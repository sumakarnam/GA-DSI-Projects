languagelearning,I would like to dedicate the rest of my 20s to language learning. Any advice?,"(Age 24 from the USA) I've realized that the only dream I currently have right now is to learn languages. (Currently no dream job, no dream of marriage, kids, physical location, etc.) I'd like to dedicate the rest of my 20s to becoming proficient in a couple languages. I currently have a B.A. in Spanish but still struggle with listening/conversation.

The languages I'd like to learn over the course of my life are Spanish, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese. I know this is a lot, so I'd like to just focus primarily on Chinese and Japanese over the next six years. I'm basically a complete beginner in these.

I'd like to use my language abilities to interact and have friendships with people from other countries. So no need to use it for academia or a career.

I'm currently unemployed and living with my parents and I'm looking to get a job and move out. $20k in savings, -$26k in federal student loan debt.

Any recommendations on what type of job to get and where to move to?

Should I get any decent-paying job in the US and then just dedicate the rest of my time to online study and Italki tutors?

Try to support myself by working in Chinese restaurants/stores?

Teach English abroad?

Get a student visa and then try to stay afloat financially with part-time work?

Something else that I haven't thought of?

I'd like to give language learning my best shot while still relatively young and then focus on figuring out my career later. The career I've considered the most is teaching, so I'd be fine trying to break into that in my 30s after focusing on language learning for a few years.

I'd appreciate any advice and life-plan ideas, no matter how weird/normal they are!",1630453380,TheSweetOnion,25

languagelearning,"The 10,000-hour method (ancient blog post by khatzumoto)","So, there you are. You’ve been mining your sentences diligently, but you still have trouble even following a conversation let alone participating, right? Maybe you still can’t follow your favorite series. Right. OK, I have a question for you. How much [language] are you listening to? Whatever your answer is, I can guarantee you that it hasn’t been enough for long enough yet. Which is why I suggest you:

Listen to 10,000 hours of [language] over the next 18 months. [(1) yes, there are more than 10,000 hours in 18 months: it’s called an estimate; (2) sleeping hours count, but obviously you’re going to want tons of waking hours, too — in any case, go for 24 hours a day.

Why 10,000? Am I obsessed with this number? Kind of. But, it is based on a rough calculation. I was fluent (perhaps not native-level, but definitely, absolutely fluent) at about 18 months. Over those 18 months, I listened to 18-24 hours per day of Japanese, which comes to 10,000 hours. Because my learning was input-focused, my listening ability was even stronger (much stronger) than my speaking ability; everyone needs to be able to understand more than they usually use — you don’t talk like a politician or a newscaster, but you need to understand how they speak. And in order to get to this state, you need to spend every waking moment listening to [language] — and every sleeping moment, too.

EVERY. WAKING. MOMENT. Of course, you may have school to go to, maybe a job. You can make small exceptions. But your school doesn’t run 24 hours a day, does it? You do sleep at night, right? Leave the [language] on all night. You have class, right? Listen to [language] in class if you can get away with it (i.e. if it won’t damage your learning experience). If not, listen to [language] while you do your homework. You take lunchbreaks, don’t you? Listen to [language]. You walk or drive or otherwise commute places, don’t you? Listen to [language] while doing it. You do have free time, right? [Language] owns your free time. You do sentences in an SRS, don’t you? Good — listen to [language] while doing your SRS entries/reps. Do you lie around and stare into space? Listen to [language] while doing it. Do you take walks? Runs? Go to the toilet? Take baths/showers? Eat? Hang out with [language]-speaking friends? Take road trips? Take plane trips? Listen to music? Surf the Internet? Cook? Clean? Wash dishes? Go shopping? Do pilates (sp?)? Tae-bo? Kung-fu? Listen to [language] during all those times.

Remember that silence thing? Silence has left the building. Every moment of your life needs to be soaked in the sweet water of [language] listening. I had Japanese playing even when I went out into the mountains behind Momoko’s house to watch the sunset. And in the toilet. And in the shower. And in bed.

languagelearning,Will learning Dutch make my German worse? Or is that just a myth?,"Oh and to clarify, I'm not talking about learning German and Dutch at the same time as a beginner (Obviously that would be a terrible idea given the similarities between them). I'm talking about learning Dutch after I've reached a conversational or proficient level in German.

I'm a native English speaker who wants to learn German and become fluent enough to use it at a professional level.

However I've heard from some people that trying to learn Dutch after German made their German worse because they kept mixing up the words. Someone even said that they had to intentionally forget their German to make any significant progress in Dutch because of the muscle memory interference.

I should also mention that I learned some basic Afrikaans throughout my high school years. Now obviously Afrikaans isn't widely used in Europe or an in demand skill compared to Dutch and German.

* Should I learn German at a high level, forget about Afrikaans and take on Dutch later stage?
* Or should I learn German to a high level, forget about learning Dutch and hold onto my basic Afrikaans for old time's sake?

I have been improving but feel as if it is only because of the amount of hours that I am studying and not the quality of those hours.

The routine goes like this.

I will listen to a 20-30 minute audio lesson, making note of any mistakes that I make. I will review and practice those mistakes for a few minutes, and then repeat the same lesson again. I will do this for 2 lessons. Next is a writing exercise. I will try to write a story using words from my vocabulary list from memory, making sure to use correct grammar and sentence structure. I will then record myself speaking that story and I will send it to a tutor for review. Each day I try to add more and more to the same story using more and more new vocabulary words. Then it's either a tutor session or Anki flashcard review. The tutor session is just grammar, sentence structure, etc. The flashcard review is usually around 100-300 words. The last hour or so is shows / movies with subtitles.

This routine usually takes around 4 hours a day mon-sun, so about 24 hours per week

I review flashcards at work when I am able to, and I also listen to music the entire night, which is usually 5-6 hours.

languagelearning,"""You can always cheat. Language learning is one of the few places where cheating is usually just another form of winning.""","In a recent thread on /lit/, a user writes:

&gt; I'm in the very early stages of learning ancient Greek, but I'm struggling with memorizing the case-endings. I feel like brute-forcing them is the most efficient way to learn them, but if anyone has some suggestions, please enlighten me.

Another user responds with the following advice:

*Post 1*

&gt; Brute forcing definitely works over time. In my Greek exams I would take out a massive piece of blank parchment and write out one or two full paradigms purely from muscle memory. That isn't a testament to my memory either, it's just how embedded they had become by then. But there were still things I struggled with too. I had certain ""routes"" I would take through the paradigm to eliminate ambiguities (easier to remember what form X looks like if you've already done forms F and T which are the ones you confuse with it most often and which ""blur"" your memory when trying to think). Rote memory really works. Eventually you just ""feel"" the structure of the table and you can fill it out by process of elimination even if you don't perfectly remember everything in 0.1s flat. But the more you do it, the more stuff will pass from ""remember it with a second of effort"" to ""remember it because I just remember it."" This happens through reading as well, but it's a nice boost to have the rote memory exercises on your side, and vice versa - you will eventually ""feel"" most of the obvious conjugations just from reading them so often.

&gt; Try using tricks like, obviously, remembering the signposts for very obvious conjugations (imperfect, aorist, perfect). But another key trick is to dwell on the thing I just said in the last paragraph: habitual use will make more and more of the conjugations come by feeling rather than a cognitive effort. Remember you're not going to be digesting a textbook forever. Soon enough you will be reading and translating, and much of what you currently find slipping from your mind will be ingrained in it. This will make the actual difficult or weird stuff that much easier to remember, because you will be expending the same amount of cognitive energy, but focusing it on fewer and more isolated things.

&gt; Trust in that process and in yourself. There's nothing magical about Greek. You WILL learn it if you just keep going. Imagine watching a TV show three or four times, then ten times. You'd start anticipating things you didn't even know you remembered, things you don't remember remembering. You could be an inattentive shitty passive viewer and you'd still be absorbing a thousand subtleties from the sheer repetition. That's happening in the background every time you feel like you're struggling.

&gt; Another trick is to remember that not all the conjugations and constructions are equal. You will mostly be encountering easy ""bread and butter"" ones, for the same reason the future perfect exists in English too but is super rare. When you do encounter hard ones, they'll stand out AS hard, and you'll be able to open your grammar and check them. That's normal. Don't get it in your head that you're ""learning Greek"" to be like a Greek-processing machine who recognises every form and decodes every page. Hate to break it to you but that's never going to happen. It happens even when you're a champion who has been reading Greek for years.

*Post 2*

&gt; Just finishing off this post. Above all remember the last bit, you aren't reading to have perfect memory of the textbook. Look at it this way: right now you are mostly digesting and remembering grammar and morphology facts. At some point, you'd like to be able to pick up a book and just read it. That's the simplest way to look at what ""learning a language"" is. But it's also too simplistic. The reality is there is a vast middle period between those two extremes, a hybrid period where you will have both a text you're working with and the textbook or grammar open. You will always be consulting dictionaries, glosses, grammars. What happens over time is not that you pass from phase 1 (assimilating and reviewing facts about language) to phase 2 (reading the language), but that you do less and less of 1 and more and more of 2, never really reaching the abolition of 1 altogether.

&gt; Not realising this was my big mistake when learning Latin and Greek. I stayed with the textbook and grammar way too long out of autistic devotion to being perfect before I was allowed to leave the shallows and really swim. But there's nothing to be lost and lots to be gained by just wading out and failing.

&gt; You could literally learn to read Greek reasonably well by half-learning morphology and just winging it with real texts, returning to the grammar as necessary. It'd be slower and (for most people, but maybe not for some dispositions) more tedious, but this has always been a valid and venerable way of learning. What you're doing by putting effort into memorising morphology is a modification of this strategy designed to make it easier and faster in the long run, not fundamentally a different strategy. Don't reify the textbook or deify the morphology tables. You can always cheat. Language learning is one of the few places where cheating is usually just another form of winning. Just saying all this because this is the advice I wish I had gotten.",1630361518,caleb-garth,4

languagelearning,"Spanish, Catalan, and French in a single semester: too much to handle?","Hello all! I'm currently attending a university in the US with an especially renowned languages department. I went into my freshman year (currently a junior) speaking no French whatsoever, and, after having taken French classes during all four of the semesters I've spent here, I am now at a C1 level (tested B2 last year but have improved since then). I really enjoy learning languages, especially within a classroom setting (I lack the discipline to do so of my own volition), so naturally I've begun considering taking another language (or two).

My father is from Catalunya, Spain, and speaks both Castilian and Catalan. Unfortunately, however, he taught me neither of his mother tongues, and, as such, I'd like to take both languages, as they're both offered at my university. I know much more Spanish than I do Catalan (I'd say I'm a B1 for Spanish and A1 for Catalan).

Would it be stupid to take all three languages - perfecting my French, improving my Spanish, and beginning Catalan - in the same semester? I really want to, but I'm worried it might just preclude me from making any progress in the first place. Also take into consideration the fact that Catalan is essentially a bridge between French and Spanish, so learning it should be quite easy, just as Spanish should prove quite easy considering my having been exposed to it all my life.",1630358175,citadelledugel,6

I've been planning to learn Chinese ever since I got to uni, but the course wasn't available so I opted for Japanese first. Do you think it would be best if I first reach a higher fluency in Japanese before I start Chinese? Lexical similarities aside, I know that there really aren't much similarities with the two languages. And in terms of grammar and speaking, I'll have to start from scratch. I'm just concerned if it would be better to get to N2 first before I fully focus on Chinese (complete beginner &amp; self-study) or should I split my attention to both and learn the two languages alternately.

languagelearning,How to get the most out of my new teacher?,"Hi everyone,  


Quick background and context for my question.  


I'm planning on doing an Interpreting Masters in two years time with the focuses being on Spanish and Mandarin Chinese. This question is regarding my Mandarin.  


I currently have 200 hours of completed study in Mandarin:  
\-100 hours = Beginner apps, beginner youtube videos, note taking, beginner text books (HSK 1 content)  
\-25 hours = Italki tutors reading stories together  
\-40 hours = Active listening ( Viki shows, Donghua, Peppa pig)  
\-12 hours = Passive listening ( CCTV, Peppa Pig, Podcasts)  
\-5 hours = Reading (Graded readers)  
\- 18 hours = Other (Handwriting practice, making sentence mining cards etc..)  


As you can see from the above I am an input advocate and love the progress i'm making using these methods. However after only minimal hours of input, I am not nearly ready to start outputting. I'd ideally like to hold off on speaking and writing for a few hundred more hours. That being said, I've found a Mandarin tutor who is a male from Beijing with a similar tone of voice to myself. So he'd be perfect to listen to and copy in the future. Furthermore, he was also an Interpreter (Mandarin-English), so knows exactly what I will need to succeed on my journey.   


My thoughts were to use our time together to read stories together while staying 99% in TL, my output would be limited to answering yes/no questions and reading out loud.  


Do you have any recommendations or suggestions as to how else I could maximise time spent with the tutor?",1630340383,Gaelgeyr,2

languagelearning,An Absolutely Amazing (and Detailed) Book Available Online as a PDF About Challenges Faced by English Learners From All Over the World,"I found a simply amazing book online that diagnoses problems that English learners have. Its called *Learner English: A teacher's guide to interference and other problems.* It goes into great detail about various challenges that English learners have in terms of pronunciation, intonation, stress, writing, listening, etc. As a native English speaker, it has even taught me subtle things about my language that I was not even aware of. It really gives you an appreciation for just how complex language is. Right now, I am learning Spanish, so I listen to a lot of native Spanish speakers. I can practically hear them talking when I am reading the Spanish section of the book.

I especially like the book because it goes country by country, so its fun to compare and contrast the challenges faced by speakers of one country to the challenges faced by speakers of another country. 

Hopefully I can keep in mind some of these challenges as I talk to my language exchange partners. 

Take a look at the book. Does it seem helpful to you? If you are a non-native English speaker, do some of the English challenges you have match up with those in the book? Are there any that are inaccurate or left out?

Enjoy!

languagelearning,Languages saved my life,"Hey everyone ! 

I wanted to share my story about language learning and if some learners had some similar experience.

I am a French native and in 2020 I lost my job because of the Covid. As the lockdown start I felt immensely bad for this loss and couldn't find any work. Besides that I've always struggle with anxiety attack and overthinking. 
With nothing but time on my hand, I decided that I would learn Spanish again, which I studied at school for 8 years but didn't used since 5 years at the time. I wasn't very good at it back in school, A2 or something like that. Besides, it wasn't a class I liked very much.

So in may 2020, I start picking grammar book and manuals to learn it again. However, it didn't went well and  I was bored of it quickly. I was also putting a lot of stress to myself for not learning fast enough. In june, I decided to stop using books and just listen to it. Just the sound and it strikes me how beautiful it was. I then decided that I will go on but in a less pragmatic way. I swore that I will never compare my Spanish to a native or my learning speed to someone else. Just enjoying it, not getting stress if there was a word I couldn't understand. This way of treating like a hobby helped me so much. By june 2021, I was able to speak it at a C1 level. I used mostly Italkie, tandem and other ressources. I've start using the same mindset for portuguese since may 2021 and same result. I am at a B2 level already. 

As I learned I realised how much pleasure I took on my class and listening to ressources. It became a way to calm anxiety. Listening to Spanish was like a warm hug to me. It brought me also a lot of proudness and made me see myself in a better light. It helped me also taking the decision to try to heal my anxiety. Thanks to this, I have never be so good in my life both personal and professional. 

I see a lot of people stugling here and I am in admiration for the hard work lots of you put in your target language. But please never forget to take pleasure in it. Languages are beautiful and have the power to heal, to make you grow as a person. If you feel like giving up, just listen the sound of your TL. I hope it will remind you why you started. Because you admired a culture and wanted to be closer to it. Or because it help you with work. Any good reasons to learn ! 

Long story short, I would love to see if someone was saved with languages just like myself. I took the decision to never stop learning new languages until my death. I am looking to learn Italian now.

Thanks for reading me ! Bon courage dans votre apprentissage !",1630307469,presidentvaljean,64

·       ¿Dónde vives? ¿Qué tipo de lugar es; una ciudad, un pueblo, una zona rural?

Vivo en Auckland. He vivido en Auckland durante catorce años desde que me mudé a los Estados Unidos. Auckland es una ciudad muy grande. De hecho es la ciudad más grande de Nueva Zelanda, pero no es la capital. En Auckland hay muchos países para hacer cosas interesantes. Hay playas, centros comerciales, estadios y mucho más. Para mí, me gustan mucho las playas en Auckland, son muy bonitas y limpias. Cerca de mi casa, hay una playa increíble llamada Mission Bay, donde me gusta mucho nadar con mi familia. 

·       ¿Qué es lo que más te gusta y lo que menos?

Pero, todo Auckland es increíble. Mi parte favorita es lo bonito que es Auckland. Cuando no estamos en ‘Level 4’, me gusta mucho salir con mis amigos y visitar lugares bonitos. Lugares como, bibliotecas antiguas, parques lozanos y torres gigantes. Sin embargo, Auckland no siempre es bonita. El clima es horrible. Ayer, quería pasear al perro, pero estaba lloviendo. Así, no pude salir. Creo que nueve de cada diez veces, va a llover. Pero en el verano, hay cielos claros y es muy bueno. 

·       En tu opinión, ¿Es un buen sitio para vivir? ¿Por qué?

En mi opinión, es un buen sitio para vivir. Hay muchas cosas que son buenas cuando vives en Auckland. La gente es muy buena, las escuelas son geniales, y las calles están limpias. Según ‘The Economist’ Auckland es la ciudad más habitable de dos mil veinte. Para mí, cuando estoy en Auckland, me siento más seguro y más feliz que en otras ciudades.

* Being interactive, they make you focus. It's not a movie where you can sit back and relax, you can't afford missing the point of the quest.
* At the same time, you can go at your own pace - when the NPC stops talking, you can re-read what they've just said, check the dictionary, etc.
* There are a lot of generic characters, dialogues with whom are in some way repetitive. And repetition is exactly what we need to revise the new vocabulary and to reinforce sentence-building patterns, right?

There is an obvious downside: quite a bit of the vocabulary is not very relevant. After all, the conversation in the bar on a Friday night is usually not about enchanted melee weapons. When I want to upgrade my outfit, I don't go to ""Divine Elegance"" to buy a pair of huntsman leather pants. And I would hardly be able to maintain my real-life diet in Tamriel... Still, there is so much everyday vocabulary in between those medieval/fantasy terms that it keeps the experience useful language-wise.

languagelearning,"Problem encountered when I learn English, please help!","&amp;#x200B;

I am an English learner from HK, probably around B1-2 level. I learn English for both my exam and interest. I believe that learning English through English content is the best for me because I am not that good at memorization. I use anki as my memorization tool (for that magical spaced repetition system), discover new vocabularies through Youtube, news, blogs, and any content that is in English. Every time I see a new word, I use the dictionary for definitions and different examples of the word in contexts(because another Reddit post tells me to do so to increase comprehension and easy to memorize), even though I did all this stuff including active recall, spaced repetition, I found myself still having difficulties recalling words I've learned when writing. Unfortunately, my English exam requires more high-level words to increase the accuracy of my writing. Sadly, I can only recognize those words when I see them, some( or most) of the words are just hiding in my brain, so damn difficult to recall and use them in actual writing. I wonder how could I improve my learning strategy? (btw, sorry for my poor grammar and rambling passage） 

conclusion:

1. How do I recall more vocabulary when I am writing? 
2. How could I learn English better/What should I implement to my learning strategy?",1630252064,Reasonable-Maize5696,6

languagelearning,Looking for perspective regarding French vocabulary learning (B1/B2),"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I have had 8 years of French in elementary school and highschool and am 24 years old now. I did very little with the language at age 19-23, but this year I started reading French comics (the magazine Le Journal de Spirou). I can read it just fine and guess the meaning of new words thanks to context. However, there were new words that kept coming back (avouer, désormais, oser, se dépêcher, empêcher...) and they didn't stick to my memory, so I decided to learn new words with Anki. I am already fluent in English so I have an idea which new words will be useful to me and which won't. For instance, old scientists with white mustaches use words I don't need to know. Parts of an airplane are not useful to me either etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I have now read approximately 660 pages and my Anki deck contains 534 words now. Learning them is pretty easy and honestly quite fun. I have never enjoyed learning French as much as now. However, I have heard people say they tried something similar but it will never end.

&amp;#x200B;

I am planning to add cards to Anki until September 2022, when I will start with Swedish classes. \_\_Hopefully by then I can read comics like a French 12 year old child? What do you guys think?\_\_ I did some quick math and if I keep encountering new words at this pace, I will have learned 2700 new words by then.

&amp;#x200B;

But like I said, I was told that this will achieve nothing and the new useful words will just keep coming. But none of them used Anki so 2700 words might look ""endless"" to them.

&amp;#x200B;

It makes me wonder how I ever learned English in such a short time. Well, I know the answer: immense immersion through TV, music and internet. But it's still crazy when I think about it.",1630234292,Kikkervelf,3

######Week 8

**Saturday**
Today I gave a score to Dragon Ball that's lower than the week before. I expected this to happen sooner or later because it is self-assessment after all, but it still
feels bad. Speaking of my scoring system, so far I'm pretty satisfied with it, I like how I made no mention of how well one should be able to follow the piece of content
on a whole at the lower levels, because this varied to great extent, depending on how much the visuals helped. 

But I'm not happy about a few lines I included like:
'understanding them[sentences] is 'the norm''. Although I do understand and expect to understand most of the sentences if I rate something above this score, it all
still feels like a miracle that I can understand them. This may just be because of how intense my learning has been, I knew basically no Spanish two months ago.

Also 'I understand the majority of sentences I see, but it feels like I still don't understand the imprtant ones'. I didn't get this feeling at all, when learning Japanese
this might have been the case, because I feel like cognates in Spanish seem to be more frequent in exposition dumps, the absence of which in Japanese lead me to not understand
'the important bits'. That, or I might just remember wrong and this didn't happen with Japanese either.

And finally I don't like my mentions of nuance, it doesn't seem to correlate in the way I thought with the other parts of my descriptions.

Going on a tangent about 'I knew basically no Spanish two months ago', I have to mention that this all feels very weird, I know it a sounds dumb but it feels
like the language is just made up, like it only exists in the bubble that is my room I use to immerse. This may be because Spanish was not a part of my life
before I started learning it, sure I heard a few songs and they spoke it in Breaking Bad, but for English I had video games, for Japanese anime and for German I live
next to the Austrian border, and the presence that Spanish had is basically nothing compared to that. The fact that I don't care that much about actually learning Spanish
might also play a part.


######Week 7

**Monday**
Phonology update: I think I can hear the difference between r and rr, other than that I'm pretty sure about afew things like: y and ll are the same sound, and they
only refer to one sound, the two different sounds I noted earlier seem to be allophones of this one phoneme, and that ü and u are the same sound. Of course I can't really
say these for certain, because there is always the possibility that I just can't hear the difference, but I have some conscious evidence for the former: the dude I mentioned
who replaces his y-s with a sh sound does the exact same thing with ll, and I hear certain words like 'yo' pronounced with both sounds that I think are allophones.

The one thing that I'm very unsure about is the sound they write with an h: I have no idea if it exists or not. If it does exist it is definitely different from a j
and it must be a much softer version of it. I do hear it sometimes but I also thought for a long time that I can hear the difference between English 'night' and 'knight' which I obviously can't.
It's crazy how much spelling can effect what you think you hear, and all the conscious evidence I have points towards the fact that the h-sound doesn't exist and that it's just a silent letter.
The evidence is the following: the word for 'and' is 'y' and is pronounced as 'i' but when it comes before an i it's an 'e' e.g. 'e importante'. But it also changes
before a hi like in 'e hiciste'. Second, I seem to hear the phenomenon I described earlier where phonemes aren't repeated at the borders of words also happens if there
is a h between two vowels as in 'voy a hacerlo' which would be pronounced as 'voyacerlo' I think. 

**Friday**
Today I switched from using headphones to using speakers for listening, and for the Youtube videos I watch it makes little difference, but Dragon Ball
is way harder to understand and I'm not sure why. Maybe it's because of the poor sound quality. Also, doing long listening sessions this way is a lot easier
for me. This, combined with my light week before has completely cured my burnout for now, I feel great.

**Saturday**
I came across a meme that comes pretty close to explaining some grammar, so I thought I should mention it:
https://www.planetaneperiano.com/neperianada/64174/latest/all/LO-HERMOSO-DE-LA-DIVERSIDAD-VERBAL
I was mostly aware of all of these and have a rough idea of what they mean except for the ones in the bottom right and some in the bottom left 
that I recognise by the ie part in them. I thought these was only one with that ie part but it turns out there are actually 3 (times 6 for the different subject of course)

Also, today I was reading a manga called Gantz and at around chapter 200 the already bad translation got so bad that they literally just leave half of it in Japanese
and just write the translation in the white space between the panels, but sometimes they don't even bother to do that. Luckily my Japanese reading is not as effortless
as my latin alphabet reading so I can avoid reading them.",1630225988,faceShareAlt,8

I’m enrolling in Med school next year, I’m 18 years old and I want to learn another language bc I love multilingualism and languages in general. 
I’m a native Spanish speaker and I speak English as a second language, I want a third one but idk which one to pick, my options are French and German. Some of the options I’m considering are:
- For German
I’m interested in German culture and also in the possibilities that are coming up for med students to study abroad in Germany or pursuing a medical residency. Don’t know if that’s a path I’m going to take but learning the language doesn’t sound bad in the meantime. 

- For French
It will be easier because I already know Spanish and english, I started learning French last year and managed to get a lot of vocabulary knowledge thanks to the similarities it has with Spanish among other factors. It also has more speakers than German does.

In conclusion, I could get fluent in French easier and faster than in German but also think that German could be more beneficial for my career.
Both cultures seem interesting to me and if we see the number of speakers, french wins.

So learning them together won’t ever confuse me with each other or get tangled up(ex. Learning Spanish and French same time). But what do you guys think?

Do you use a dictionary and/or a translator when you write as well? Or is it better to forgo these tools and just write based on whatever you’ve successfully managed to retain?

The last year I wanted to learn another language, German but, in the language institutes of my town, from 18 you can enroll (I think that's stupid). I tried to learn by myself but I couldn't because I lose focus easily.

Yesterday I noticed a little building which had German and French flags on its walls. I asked the teacher about German classes but she told me that something happened to the German teacher and he couldn't teach anymore so, my other option was French.

I don't know if I'd get interested in because: If I wait until I turn 18, I barely could get a A1 level in German but I would be more interested, in the other hand, maybe learning French isn't too exciting but at least I would've learned something.

Written Norwegian and Danish are very similar (Could we say that they are the same language in the written form, just as similar as Serbian and Croatian or American and British English are)?

languagelearning,Are there any bizarre rules in your TL or others you have heard of that make you think about reality differently?,"One of the things I like most about languages is how they offer a different way to look at reality through their rules. It is a little thing, but it always blew my mind that in Arabic you put the action verb before the name it belongs to, for example: Walked Sarah, Spoke Sarah. That it is as valid way of conveying reality as Sarah Walked, Sarah spoke.

I may be way off here, but isn’t the way that the Chinese see time, with less emphasis on the past, derived from tenses in their languages? I’m sure I heard that in a talk once. 

These reconstructions of reality are why I think it is important to preserve languages and why it would be sad to move towards a universal translator type system or an Esperanto. It can give you an entirely different reading of reality which is as valid as your own.

languagelearning,I feel like giving up,"This post might get removed for being low quality content but I can't help but share my frustration with people who might understand what I'm going through.

It's been 5/6 years since I started learning English. Those initial years were really great and I made some progress in the middle phase too. I adopted new learning techniques, employed immersion technique and everything that had been suggested to me from stopping to translate in my head to forcing myself to get stuck in situations that require me to speak English.

But these days, it's going really bad. I have not been making any progress and even seems to be making errors that are not expected from a learner like me. They say I'm already an advanced learner but I don't sure about it. I get scared when I have to interact with my professors using English and inevitably make mistakes. However, when it comes to formal writing or like creative writing(writing essays or notes), I do quite well. But when it comes to interacting with people, I fail miserably. It has gotten to a point that every time before interacting with someone, I make sentences and search them on google to find validation and if I don't find any similar structures, I feel like my sentence has errors in it and end up using the sentence but having regrets afterwards. My  lack of confidence has been getting me into a lot of troubles recently.  For example, I had failed to report my professor that I had sent them an important document, I wanted to say that I'm sorry that I hadn't informed him earlier with a direct sentence like "" I sent you my paper, I'm sorry to inform you this late(this as in the degree of late)"" and I did so but had regrets after sending it. Also my habit of making errors while typing is making the situation even worse. Instead of writing 'draft' I had written 'drift' and I didn't have the nerve to tell them afterwards. I'm fed up, I want to quit. But I possibly cannot because it's late.

languagelearning,Learning new languages is hard for teenagers,"I am a 15 year old wanna-be polyglot and, as stated in the title, I find learning new languages to be hard for those in my age group. I have taken a serious interest in studying French and Japanese in my free time but find my motivation thinning no matter what I do.

All of my friends and classmates are too busy with video games, social media, and other random things on the internet that I hardly have anyone to share my language learning passion with and keep me motivated. Plus, the ones who do have some remote interest in learning a new language don't really take it all that seriously.

Since I'm just a kid, I can't book any classes for myself nor buy resources to help me as freely as I'd like to and have to use pirated textbooks online to study.

At school, I also get made fun of for being a ""weeb"" by wanting to learn Japanese; however, my desire to learn Japanese isn't just limited to opening Duolingo once or twice every few months, but rather, it includes me rigorously reviewing my Anki cue cards every single day and night.

Moreover, in my school, French is also a subject being taught. Unfortunately, the school system ABSOLUTELY SUCKS at teaching languages and, as a result, has made all of my friends hate the French language. This is kinda frustrating for me when I try to actually speak in French and people in my class just start yelling ""Baguette baguette baguette"" mindlessly.

The only solace I've found is using the Internet to connect with other language learners digitally (through Discord, Reddit, etc) but then again it's hard to form meaningful connections over the Internet and I rarely find anyone close to my age who's taking language learning as seriously as I am.

Anyways, sorry for the rant. I just felt like I needed to get this off my chest. Worst of all, Im starting grade 11 next year, which is the year that I've been told a multitude of times that ""grades matter"", so I already know I'll have less and less time to continue studying my languages.

languagelearning,Am I doing the language immersion part correctly? Need some advice.,"I have Been learning Spanish for around 18 months. Whenever I try to watch Spanish tv shows or other video contents with Spanish subtitles, I always end up being unable to follow the context after a few minutes and end up turning on the English subtitles. 

After seeing where I lack and putting some effort into it, today I was finally able to start a new show and understand few episodes with Spanish subtitles. I believe this will help me train my ear to these new sounds. 

The question I have here is should I stop when I don’t understand a sentence/word, learn it and continue or should I just let the flow go and keep immersed in the story and go on? 

I tried the former and after 30 minutes was tiered and hated watching anymore. However I am able to watch 2 long episodes using the latter method. 

Which is more beneficial for me and which should I follow?",1630070921,Cosmos_spectator,7

languagelearning,Spanish or Russian?,"So basically I’m trying to choose between learning Spanish or Russian in depth. Some background, I am actively learning German and have elementary proficiency. For Spanish, I took high school courses and tested out in college, for Russian, it took college courses and get elementary proficiency on the military’s DLPT (the basic basic level of it).

So the differences for me are the I can pick up Russian better than a lot of my peers have and the Cyrillic alphabet isn’t hard at all for me. Plus I like to learn it and think it’s kind of cool. However, it isn’t widely spoken. Spanish on the other hand is widely spoken and the utility of it for work or travel is readily apparent, plus I don’t have difficulty picking Spanish up. However, I am not really enthusiastic about learning it and I feel like lots of people in America learn that for their second language if they’re going to learn one (go to any Midwest, rural high school and I bet Spanish will be the only foreign language offering if not accompanied by a remote learning French or Spanish offering).  So maybe I’m thinking it’s not as niche/unique to know here in America? Although it certainly would be useful and helpful since it’s our rapidly growing second language in the nation. 

So basically I feel like it comes down to utlility versus fun for me. What thoughts or advice do any of you have? Thanks!",1630064809,SilverBadger90,2

languagelearning,My progress and why you should keep learning,"For some background, I’m a mandarin learner who’s been learning serious for about a year and a half now. Almost a year ago, I started recording how long I spent each day studying/listening to/reading Chinese. In a couple days, I will reach the exactly one year mark, and I have recorded around 900 hours of Chinese study. Here are some things I’ve discovered.

1.) I never give myself credit for what I CAN do, but always beat myself up for what I CANNOT do.

I’ve gotten to the point in Chinese where I can randomly read a news article or internet article with ease, and can watch a YouTube video or show (with Chinese subtitles) and understand virtually all of what it being said. Theoretically, I should be overjoyed at this, since getting to this point was my goal not that long ago. But since there are still many things i have a hard time saying, I still feel like a beginner in a lot of ways. This is despite the fact that I can now hold conversations pretty well. Just remember to give yourself credit for what you’ve accomplished.

2.) keep going, keep going, keep going. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gotten lazy or thought about stopping, whether it be to learn another language or just something else. Remember that doing remarkable things takes a loooong time, and that doubting yourself and what you are doing is to be expected. Ignore those doubts though.

3.) Don’t worry too much about methodology. As long as you are immersing, you are progressing.

Anyways, hope that can help some of you.",1630044516,MinusInfinityKarma,37

I tried to post it in /r/LearningEnglish but it seems that the sub is dead. So I try it here now.

In the year of 2017 I took an english test it was B2 level. At the speaking part I scored max points and got graded with C1. In the other parts writing and grammar I got B2.

Now 5 years passed and I got naturally immersed with even more english. I'd say my ability in writing, grammar, listening and speaking clearly improved.

Now the thing is the following: I'm pretty fluent but holy shit my grammar sucks ass.I can talk fluently and even write precisely what I want to say but I think I'm doing so many mistakes and often I'm really unsure if my output is correct.

To say it with a metaphor: I think my english ability is like a good crafted sword but it's dull as fuck. Now I want to polish and sharpen it up. And I think the best way to do so, is to drill some grammar because this is what I've never done in the past. Learning grammar. And I think if I get to know the rules I'm becoming more confident.

Can you recommend me something? The thing is I'm a little bit scared buying something and then get bored because I think I still know a lot but on the other hand I'm sure there are a lot of basic concepts which I don't know about. Is there a book you know about I could use to sharpen my english skills?Like a good grammar book in english for english?",1630016832,Noridem,6

Me and my partner have been thinking about learning Japanese for a while now. I am bilingual English/Dutch and she is a native English speaker.

We currently have zero knowledge of Japanese (or any Asian language for that matter), so we are struggling a little bit on how to get started. Because we both work full-time we need tools/resources to study at our own pace.

We are a little oldschool so hardcopy textbooks are not an issue for us but browsing on Amazon gives us so many choices for beginners that we are even more overwhelmed now.

We have also been looking at platforms like Verbling where you can get help from tutors as well plus we’ve been browsing on Udemy as well for pre-recorded video courses. We are willing to pay for quality material so that is not an issue.

Most of the information I have found seems to implicate that it's best to start with vocabulary and grammar first (in Romaji) before getting into the writing systems.

languagelearning,Suggestions on how to learn without translating?,"Hello Everyone :)

Apologies in advance for the long post! 

TL;DR: Ideas/suggestions on learning a language without the use of translating. 

I have been on/off the boat trying to learn different languages for forever now :P I have a “small”ish list of the languages I want to learn, each of which has a different reason for it. Throughout the years, I get super pumped and just as quickly lose steam and then I stop, only to repeat the pattern over and over again. I find that I spend more time trying to figure out *how* to learn + finding the resources rather than actually learning. THANK YOU so much to this sub for introducing me to Anki. Now my dilemma has continued and persisted and I think I’ve finally figured out why. Please bare with me!!

When I was a student at University, we had a language exchange program and my language buddy and I would meet every week and just talk for a couple of hours. They would point at things around me and say it in the language I was trying to learn (Brazilian Portuguese), then after learning a few words – they would test me on it. We also talked about our weeks, topics in general we were interested in and we would translate each other’s sentences, go over grammar/how to structure a sentence, etc. It was such an amazing experience! I got so good I was able to talk at a basic level about soccer and politics!!! But then my language partner had to return to Brazil and then I had no one to practice with so I’m basically back to full fledged beginner. 

I’ve tried different apps and I like certain aspects of some more than others. My favourite thus far is Rosetta Stone because it forces me to learn that language in that language rather than based on translating. I also find that when I am taught grammar in a more traditional way (i.e. this is an adverb, adjective) it goes completely above my head, whereas with Rosetta Stone I’ll notice the patterns presented (conjugations) and it sticks so much easier in my head, it feels almost intrinsic? My only qualm with it, is the lack of focus on pronunciation. Like in English, we have “ship” and “sheep” which sound very similar and could easily be mixed up. Or like how you make an R sound in English is different than the way you do it in Spanish (placement of the tongue). 

In my ideal world I would learn languages by basically trying to imitate being a baby/child: Learning the different types of sounds a language makes, learning words by pointing to things, stringing together basic sentences, immersing myself in different ways to learn more abstract words, and failing to speak properly over and over again (and being corrected) with a native speaker. 

I was thinking:

Purchase the Fluent Forever Pronunciation Trainer in my target language

Use Rosetta Stone

Find a tutor on italki

Find children’s books, youtube, radio, etc in target language just to feel more immersed 

Input new words along with image into Anki + Have a different deck in Anki dedicated to images and pronunciation (this idea comes from memrise but specifically the Russian course where there are images to help you remember how something is pronounced so like the letter п has a picture of 2 pillars)

languagelearning,Alternatives to Anki?,"Hi!
I've been using Anki almost everyday for the past few weeks.
The problem is that I just create cards, but don't review them. It feels almost like a chore sometimes, even though other times it's a matter of starting the review and then I'm in the flow.

I'm a strong believer of reaching high levels in a language through reading. Usually I create Anki cards from the vocabulary words I don't understand while reading.

Is there an alternative to Anki to remember the words I encounter while reading? Because at some point the deck becomes too big and the daily Anki review can take like 2 hours, time that could be spent reading.

Or could you just tell me some pieces of advice about enjoying Anki more? Like, is there a way to set a maximum number of words to repeat each day (like 20 and not 200)?

The problem is that the fantasy genre (sci-fi, too) has too many words I don't know (usually for descriptions that help build the world of the story).

How would you go about this? Should I approach it with intensive reading (example: learning every word from the first chapter, and then see how it goes) or what?

languagelearning,"Is the Pimsleur ""only go 30 minutes a day for optimum learning retention"" real?","Since Pimsleur is a subscription-based service, I'm thinking that it might be a load of BS. You're paying every month for it. I think they want to suck the money as long as they can, each month you go adds another $20.

Technically, the faster you get it done, the less you pay in the long run. That means that if you are to hypothetically double down, you can complete 60 lessons in one month instead of 30 and end up paying for one less month in the long run. Why would they want that? They'd make less money.

I'm unsure because I don't want to diminish my learning experience, but I recall learning somewhere that the best way to learn fast is to increase your immersion and how much you surround yourself with a new language.

To explain my situation: my university doesn't offer any courses in Italian, so out of all the ones it offers, I recently chose Spanish. I've already signed up and got my books, started the Spanish course on Duolingo too. But now, another organization is offering a course in Italian in co-operation with my university. It's not as comprehensive as the Spanish course (1 credit less), but they both begin at roughtly the same time (I don't know the exact schedule of the Italian course yet).

I have almost zero prior knowledge of either of these languages, just a couple of phrases and a few words. Italian interests me quite a bit more than Spanish does, but the current situation is such that I can't just do the Italian course, it's either both or just Spanish.

languagelearning,I'm so tired of failing to learn french; now I'm in school and it's even harder,"When I was not in post-secondary, I failed to learn french for many reasons.

I also had to build my own curriculum across multiple websites, apps, subscriptions, etc., which felt frustrating, confusing, and it never felt like I was learning in a convenient order.  


Now that I'm in post-secondary, I've learned how to handle stress, build structure, and have good habits -  but I have no time! I also have no money for apps - mayyyybe I could justify one.

languagelearning,Heritage Learner Finally Reached C1 After Self Study,"Don't really have any one else to share this with who would care (about language learning) so here I am.

About a year ago I became really interested in re exploring my family's culture and history. Improving my Spanish to be able to interact with the culture in its original element seemed like the obvious first step. I've been conversationally fluent my entire life thanks to Spanish being spoken by literally every one at home. However, at the start of this process, I really lacked a lot of literary vocabulary  (I had literally never read in Spanish, ever, apart from in businesses / restaurants) and specialized domain vocabulary. I also hadn't used my Spanish (apart from conversing with relatives from time to time) in almost 10 years. 

I did the opposite of what most immersion sites suggest -- instead of focusing on consuming narrow content, I basically just blasted my ears with 3+ hours of Spanish podcasts every single day, about literally any and every thing, often being discussed by numerous speakers. If at any point during my day I could have my earphones in listening to Spanish, I did. I would sometimes pause to quickly look up word definitions if it was repeated more than once, and quickly continue listening. I was very aggressive with vocabulary via Anki to start (35 new cards a day to begin, now tapered down to 10 a day).

I primarily consume content from the country my family is from, but don't shy away from content I find captivating that is produced by native Spanish speakers from other countries. I read a lot of YA books (where I can focus on engrossing myself in the story with very, very minimal word look ups) and spend 1-2+ hours a day reading almost every day. I also text all of my friends all day long in Spanish and have hour+ long phone conversations in Spanish with family and friends a few times a week.

I still battle with the subjunctive tense and make mistakes when conversing but people always understand what I'm saying. Overall I am still working on adding vocabulary (Feel like I'm always finding new words!) and my speed when speaking. (I can speak pretty fast but there's a noticeable increase in errors in re: conjugations / tense usage etc when I try to speak too fast). I have always had strong pronunciation so I'm not concerned with my accent so much. Sorry for such a long write up, this was a damn ramble. 

I guess I just want to say: keep going, and you will improve. Make the decision to interact with the language as much as possible every single day and there is no way you will not make some sort of progress. Thanks for reading.",1629875441,louisprimo,16

languagelearning,Do foreign languages develop slang as quickly as America?,"I noticed a lot of youtubers (primarily the younger ones) who speak english as a second language are very adept with American slang. I'm assuming it's American because because I recognize most of it coming from the AAVE. It got me to start thinking about how much the internet has sped the growth of english in general to non-english speaking countries. 

As an American I can confidently say that modern slang obviously changes with each generation. Today's words mostly come from internet and rap culture (just like in 2010 and probably in 2000).

Most others are somewhere in between: they think studying is very important at first, but you should use immersion more the more you progress with the language. I believe they implicitely refer to the [Input Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis): immersion is invaluable when input is comprehensible, but studying is better or even necessary if you can't understand much. A way to measure how comprehensible something is is the [Comprehension Percentage](https://www.sinosplice.com/life/archives/2016/08/25/what-80-comprehension-feels-like): how many words you know for every 100 in a book.

languagelearning,What are some languages of which TV news announcers don't read aloud verbatim what is shown on subtitles?,"Hong Kong Cantonese is.  Not sure about Cantonese TV in other areas but they should be like Hong Kong.  I can't imagine news subtitles in spoken Cantonese.

Spoken Cantonese (SC) can be written but no formal settings would do so.  News subtitles are always in Standard Written Chinese (SWC).  SWC are close to Mandarin.

I think what news announcers see and read from their teleprompter is identical to what the audience see on subtitles.  They see SWC in the eyes and speak SC in the mouth on the fly.

I know they see SWC because they occasionally make mistakes that can't be explained if not SWC.  Example: possessive (the 's in ""John's Dad"") is 的 in SWC and is 嘅 in SC.  News announcers see 的 and say 嘅.  的 however is also in the name Baltic Sea (波羅的海).  This name is unchanged between SWC and SC.  Careless news announcers would blindly substitute this 的 and say 波羅嘅海, which becomes ""pineapple's sea"".  This is a classic joke.

So i have an on&amp;off relationship with chinese, where i never progress past the very first lesson. The reason? I can’t find a system for this language! Every course i looked at was focusing on introducing the symbols and make you memorize the expressions, and i know how helpful and fast this can be to put you on track, especially conversational. The thing is that this is not how i learn. When i was learning Spanish i had to make sense and break down everything to the original grammatical rule first and understand the different usage of things before i can keep the phrase for life. Is there anything like that in chinese?
The other problem i have is the tones and pronunciation. Oh my this is the toughest ever. I have really hard time distinguishing which is which and needlessly to say I cannot even say them properly.
The last thing is the writing system. Is there any to begin with? I know there’s no alphabet but is there a way of scheming those symbols that makes them easier to retain?

languagelearning,What do you think about using the Koch method for ear training?,"By «Koch method» I'm referring to Koch's method of teaching morse code, which has this central idea:

Instead of first teaching you to listen to all the Morse alphabet at a slow speed and only then slowly increasing speed, the Koch method teaches you to listen to **full-speed** Morse code *from day one*. The trick is that you only get introduced to two symbols at a time. Once you can listen to those two symbols with 90% accuracy, you're introduced to two more symbols, and so on.

The reasoning behind the Koch method is that, if you get used to slow Morse code from the beginning, it's hard to then get used to full-speed Morse code.

I've been thinking about ***applying this idea to language acquisition***. My theory is that if you get used to slow audio, with **clearly separated words** during your entire “level 1” course, it's going to be hard for you to adapt to full-speed audio with **connected speech**, because it's not just the speed that changes, it's the pronunciation itself!

So, my idea is: Why not listen to full-speed audio with connected speech **right from the first lesson**, but only introduce a very limited number of words per lesson? Say, instead of Pimsleur's 15 new words per lesson, keep it at 10 new words per lesson, and focus on n-grams (chunks) instead of individual words. If the learner is using recordings produced this way, he/she can always lower the speed to 0.5x when stuck with a particularly difficult phrase, and it will still be natural speech... just slowed down. The opposite is not true: If you use slow recordings, it will not become natural speech if you speed them up.

After a bit of Googling I found that user emk shared [this exact same idea in the language-learners.org forum 4 years ago](https://forum.language-learners.org/viewtopic.php?p=64479#p64479). One of his comments resonated with me:

&gt; full-speed listening seems to decay much more slowly than formal grammar study and vocab lists. 

Back in 2017 I spent 3 months transcribing Chinese dramas by hand. This helped me a lot both with my listening and with my writing abilities when I took the HSK 5 that same year. I repeated the intensive listening exercise (minus the writing) with Shanghainese drama «Meteor Garden» in 2019, and last week I discovered that I can still remember some lines from back then!

I know some language learners have also used transcription as the core of their routine, and this has helped them immensely.[This thread in the language-learners.org forum is particularly encouraging](https://forum.language-learners.org/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=9631).

*TL;DR: Do you think that using natural speed audio right from the first lesson + only introducing a few words per lesson + making intensive listening (maybe with transcription exercises) to comprehensible input the very core of the curriculum... is a good idea?*",1629767893,SpanishInput,14

languagelearning,My progress so far,"Note: this is mainly for me to keep track of my progress because I'm always losing my tracked information! But you guys can have a look at my language learning journey

I started learning Brazilian Portuguese during lockdown, so what I believe would be in april/may 2020 and currently I'm at around (I think) a B1 level. I made lots of progress very quickly considering I was self taught (but then there was nothing else to do in lockdown...). I'm now having lessons on and off from my partner and a friend whenever we're able but I haven't been able to practice my speaking as much as I like. From today I'll start scooby doo in Portuguese and focus more on speaking Portuguese rather than just reading and writing. I'm also not sure if I'm at B1 as, oddly, I haven't been able to find a good test for it. But I am able to have basic conversations in Portuguese with my partner about various topics, mostly when we don't want to include English speakers around us in our conversation 😅

And today is also the day I'm starting French! This will be less of a focus but I've been offered free lessons by a friend so I thought I'd take advantage of it. I'm not too worried about mixing up the languages as they feel quite different (unlike Portuguese and Spanish which I tried at one point, didn't go well) and I'll be focusing my time more on Portuguese and have French as a sort of 'breather'.

languagelearning,[Need advice] Building vocabulary out of the words you encounter spontaneously throughout everyday life,"Hello,

Here is the situation. Very often I come across a new word or phrase outside of the dedicated learning time. For example, I am simply *thinking about an everyday object or a common concept* and then realize that I don't know how it is called in my target language. If not the laptop, then the phone is always at hand, so I look it up in a dictionary (or I don't but I surely can). Or I may be just browsing the news in my target language or come across something in my Facebook feed. 

*My impossible dream*: the moment I see this new word/phrase, it (together with the translation and with an example of how to use it in context) gets added to an app that supports spaced repetition.

*Reality*: I don't do anything about this word/phrase. Most of the times, later I can't even recall what the word/phrase was (although I remember coming across some useful piece of vocabulary, so I am left with this frustrating thought of losing it).

*My realistic dream*: something in the middle, combining **a good habit** (that I have yet to develop) and **a good app**. Now, I would like to hear your ideas about these two components. 

1) If you succeeded in building your vocabulary in a similar spontaneous way, tell me your story! Do you put everything on hold and spend a minute to add the word, or do you make a quick note and return to your notes at the end of the day/week? If you struggled with self-discipline, how did you build your habit in the end? 

2) What app do you use? My ideal app should have *spaced repetition feature* (I used Anki in the past and quite liked how they implemented this feature there) and *integration with a dictionary* (basically, the ability to add words to my database right from the dictionary without selecting text, copy-pasting, etc., which is very cumbersome on the phone). If a word has multiple meanings, I would like to be able to add only selected meanings to my database.

I think I understand the material without translating (maybe because of the pictures), but if I don’t translate, I’m not confident I’m actually acquiring the language.

So I’m curious what it “feels” like to read in your target language, from the early stages through the fluent ones, and how things might evolve over that time. 

Should I be trusting myself at the start that I understand the material and things will naturally become more clear as time goes on?

Or is it normal to translate for a while and then things suddenly switch and you just absorb? Or maybe it’s more of a progression?

Is the goal to understand the general meaning of what’s going on? Or the individual meaning of words?

languagelearning,I think I hit a wall (English),"I've been learning English since I was like 7. I had it in school, but I wasn't really great back then. My mum signed me up for an English course when I was 10, I really enjoyed it and I was getting better, but I had a real breakthrough when I was 13 and discovered One Direction (lol). I learned about 2000/3000 words in 2 months, when I religiously rememebered every song by heart, every translation and every possible grammar rule used in them. Then, when I was 14, I was put in a group of 19-20 years old on that English course. They were preparing to take the most important exams we take when we graduate high school (an equivalent of A-levels I guess). I was struggling a lot but in half a year I catched up and... nothing has hapened since then. I never had to do ANYTHING in class ever since, I aced the same exams five years later (got 100% on both basic and advanced level) and haven't even opened an English book since I was 14. I went to uni, we had a year of Enligsh and I learned some of the basic business English vocabulary that is related to my degree. I am 22 now, I use English every day on Twitter, I watch videos in English, I search the Internet in English, I travel a lot (well, I did before covid) and after a few hours of adjusting I am able to have full conversations on different topics with people.

But I also still make many grammar mistakes, I hit a wall and I don't seem to make progress anymore. I would place myself at strong B1, but the exams I took are said to be around B2/C1, so maybe that's my level, I have no idea. I have always prided myself in never having to le-learn any words or phrases. I hear a word once and remember it for the rest of life. Well, I haven't lost that ability, it still works for me in Italian and Norwegian (zero boring vocabulary reviews, yay!!), but every time a see a new C1 level word in English, I just cannot seem to remember it. 

I feel like the only soultion would be to move out to an English-speaking country like I have always dreamed to do. I would be forced to learn new vocab every day, practice and enjoy the language. I don't know if I should force myself to continue learning. Maybe it is okay to give up, to stay on my B1/B2/C1 level, just enjoy the fact that I undestand 99,9% of content i see every day, be easy on myself and learn a new language? How much do I need a C1 English, anyway? I find so much joy in learning Italian lately, maybe that should be my new goal? Reach B1/B2 in Italian and then start with another language and another, stop pushing myself and just enjoy other languages and cultures now? Can anyone who has been in the same place tell me what worked for them?

Back then in 2020 I was also learning some Korean and knew the writing system and basic grammar (I'm taking a break from it but I totally wanna study it later in the future). I do have some experience studying languages. I did study Spanish (in school) and French (at home as my family speaks it) at the same time and I find those languages to be fairly simple. I'm only able to have simple conversations in those languages. Irish was compulsory in school but me having a conversation in Irish is impossible haha.

It wasn't until February 2021 that I decided to take Japanese seriously. I joined a Japanese Discord server where I could practice with learners and natives and receive help pretty quickly. I learned kana pretty quick and I was excited to be able to partially read Japanese. On and off throughout the months of this year I've been trying to wrap my head around basic grammar. It's been a slow progress but mostly due to procrastinating and giving up. 

I wonder what my level would be if I actually started 11 years ago. I decided that I genuinely wanna master the language and speak like a native even if that takes 10 years to do so. But I always feel like I'm going too slow and that I'm not really making any progress. I do understand that it takes longer to learn compared to romance languages for example.

For those of you who are learning hard languages, how do you stay motivated throughout your journey?",1629649455,thespacecowboyy,11
languagelearning,English as a second language," 

Hi!

I'm a french Canadian and I have English classes. I have to write about myself, my new classmate and the new teacher. 8-10 sentences each.

Of course I know the basics in English, but I would like to really improve and write something with a better vocabulary, better grammar. I want to impress the teacher and to learn a lot while doing it. Instead of just using basics (like every other students). I want my homework to have 90% or more, I really want to excel.

I think I have a very good understanding of English, whoever my pronunciation isn't really good since I rarely speak it. I only speak it my new English classes (we have to).

I'm looking for someone who could show me how to write things better. I would really like using ""advanced/expert"" words, structure, grammar...

languagelearning,Studying a language at university is not a good way to learn.,"I was at a bar in Paris with my girlfriend and a friend of hers when an english girl came over to speak to us. It was pretty clear it was just because she wanted to practice her french, which is fine as it is very difficult to practice your french in paris if you don’t have french friends as everyone responds in english (unless they are old). 

I quickly noticed she was only a beginner  as she had such a thick english accent that it was difficult to understand what she was saying. She would also often forget simple words like ‘travail’ and would make frequent grammar mistakes, it seemed to me that she was translating directly from english to french in her head. Out of curriosisty I asked her how long she had been studying french for and it turns out she just finished 2 years of studying only french at university and did 2 years of A levels before that! This shocked me as, although I am only at an intermediate level, my level of french is much higher than hers despite me only self studying since 8 months. I don’t mean to say that in a cocky way, I make frequent errors and still have a long long way to go.

I have a feeling that possibly she simply just goes to her university classes but doesn’t consume lots of french content which would explain her low level.

Do you guys think university classes are worth it? I think for me, I would gain more value out of watching 1 hour of french content than sitting in a classroom for 1 hour. Also, one of them options costs £27,000 over 3 years (in the U.K.) and one is completely free! Also, what career options does a french degree really give you? It’s so easy to learn a language from home right now I don’t see the need to go to university.

She explained that her university course isn’t just about learning the language but also about french culture. However I don’t think university is the best place to learn about culture either, you learn about culture from living in the country! To really understand culture you have to live it.",1629640289,Temporary_Media2888,56

I still suck at German but I know that if I carry on for a little longer, it might become more enjoyable &amp; easier to do.

But even when I sucked, I still found learning German fun. I was learning all this stuff &amp; I still am learning a lot but I’ve been doing German for almost 7 months now (had to take a month off tho so more like 6 months) and I’ve dedicated an hr every day to it &amp; I feel kinda defeated right now. I still suck a lot &amp; I know to be decent I’ll need to dedicate a lot of time to it, and it’s just kinda soul destroying in a way.

I haven’t done any German for 10 days (I was on holiday for 7 days tho &amp; was constantly out during stuff with my family so I guess that isn’t really my fault) and I just slightly dread doing it again bc it doesn’t feel like a habit anymore, and I keep wondering what is even the point anymore.

She and her friend went to polish stores and pretended to only speak English to not only get better at it, but also to have some fun. At that point English was not common in Poland so they usually caused a minor inconvenience to the workers.

Today I drove hundreds of miles to Kraków, the second biggest City in Poland and decided to only use English whenever I go out. 
I went to the nearest McDonalds, put on my best British accent as its the easiest one for me to pull off and managed to order food. The lady panicked a little bit at the beginning but I understood her English and she was pretty good at it.
My next destination was a little cafe and I thought that since they're not a big business like mcdonalds maybe they didn't get many clients who didn't know English but I came in just at the right moment because I saw an old British couple and the barista having a nice chat in English. Managed to order coffee with a little bit of stuttering because my British accent started to slip half way through but I don't think she noticed as she was also nervous.

It feels really good to be able to communicate with people in your second language. It shows just how much I learned over the years.

It's also really funny how people get nervous when they have to speak English no matter how fluent they are.

I'm a Hungarian guy, who had learned English, and now learning Japanese. It's been a year since I've started my Japanese journey, I started it because I was bored in lockdown and always wanted to learn the language! 

My progress so far: I can read hiragana, katakana easily, and I have a pretty good understanding of the language, until I know the words! This is why I started reading recently (about a month ago), no not child books, since I found my vocab size is way beyond that, I usually read Slice of Life mangas that has furigana! Couple of days ago I started reading even more difficult mangas since I couldn't find more intermediate content (or at least not of my liking)! This way I read less every day, but introduce more words! (I usually read 1-2 chapters a day, which is between 60-80 manga pages, the most amount of words i didn't know was 132 so far, in a day).

So here's my question! Since I have about 10-15% of the words as new daily, should I read the same 60-80 pages more than once, to make sure I don't just look up and forget the words?

languagelearning,I made a Chrome Extension (Free!) for us that enables dual subtitles on Netflix,"**TLDR**: Here's the extension:

[Dual Subtitles for Netflix - Chrome Web Store (google.com)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dual-subtitles-for-netfli/ljnmedkgcgidbbjhbkdonempgcgdhjfl?hl=en)

It uses the browser's built-in translator so just turn on the subtitles for your target language, and make sure the translator is activated (Right Click --&gt; ""Translate to \_\_\_"")

**It does NOT work when the original subtitles are in the following languages:** (Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Thai,  Japanese, Traditional Chinese, and Vietnamese). Only because they're injected with images so the browser can't detect them. (\*\*^(possible work-around mentioned at the bottom))

Yes, it is [open source](https://github.com/DeeFrancois/netflix-dual-subs#readme)!

# Why did I make it?

Dual subtitles are an incredibly underrated language learning tool! They make the method of watching a show with its native subs a little more efficient by making it so you don't have to keep another tab open to constantly look up words.

Unfortunately, it isn't a commonly available feature so I figured I'd learn how to make it available myself. After getting it to work for NRK TV (Norwegian service, extension available [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nrk-tv-language-learning/lmjfcijpnghdkpnoakgljodpjnimbakp?hl=en)), I thought I'd try getting it to work for Netflix.

# What's different about this one?

There are other dual subtitle extensions already but they all work by downloading the subtitle tracks for both languages and displaying them together. **The problem with that is the subtitles are based on the audio tracks, so often times you're seeing completely different sentences.** While that's fine for people getting familiar with a language, I feel like I learn way more with 1:1 translations (or as close to 1:1 as Google Translate can get).

Also, the other extensions are either not open-source, cost money, or they're too obtrusive. I just wanted something lightweight that felt like I was still just watching Netflix rather than using a full-blown language learning program.

Tons of people still find the other extensions useful though so don't just take my word here. Definitely check them out if you haven't already and if you think you'd want more learning oriented features.

# How do you use it?

* Turn on the subtitles in your target language
* Right click --&gt; ""Translate to English"" (or whatever your native language is)

That's it! You can also click the extension icon at the top for customization options and the on/off button. Since I wanted to keep it simple, the only settings are Opacity, Font Size, and Text Color.

(There are also two buttons on the player so you can still adjust font size in full screen)

I'm happy with how it is now but if there's a feature that isn't too obtrusive that you think I absolutely need to add, feel free to let me know.

# More rambling (sorry for the long post):

*  Incase you didn't know, you can browse for shows by subtitle/audio language here [https://www.netflix.com/browse/subtitles](https://www.netflix.com/browse/subtitles). Finding a show through there will actually enable audio/subtitle tracks that are hidden by default. (But just putting the language in the search bar is better for finding actual foreign shows).
* \***\*** You can also watch shows in your native language and then tell your browser to translate the secondary subtitles into whatever language you're learning (including languages that I said aren't supported). But I don't know if that's an effective way to learn and it's too many steps to ask of people so I don't advertise it as a main feature.
* Google Translate is not perfect! The accuracy is fine for me, but I'm someone that already knows enough to notice the mistakes. The benefit of using the other dual subs extensions is that you are guaranteed to get sentences that make sense even if they aren't direct translations.
* [Here's the link again](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netflix-language-learning/ljnmedkgcgidbbjhbkdonempgcgdhjfl?hl=en), please rate if you end up liking it! I'm a recent grad and this is a project I actually use regularly so I'd love to be able to use this in my portfolio.",1629545757,DuhMeTreeUs,56

languagelearning,Struggling with pronunciation,"I'm a native English speaker who started to learn French at the end of July. My main challenges are around pronunciation:

* I can't differentiate (e, ɛ), (ə, œ, ø), and (ɔ, o)
* I can't differentiate or make the nasal vowels
* I can't make the ʁ or ɥ sounds

I've spent hours watching YouTube videos on IPA and French phonetics (including Fluent Forever). I've looked elsewhere on the Internet for audio recordings, repeated what I heard, and recorded myself. Every week, I take two italki lessons with professional teachers. I feel like I'm just winging it and hoping for the best. 

The last time I learned a new language was five years ago. I don't remember having a hard time differentiating the sounds in Mandarin. If anything, it was making the ""c"" initial sound and tones (3rd and 4th) correctly. I overcame these issues on my own by doing audio drills. Now I'm putting in more time and effort with French but I don't see any sign of improvement. Since I'm a bit of a perfectionist, part of me thinks I'm expecting too much for someone who hasn't even spent a full month learning French. 

If you've struggled with pronunciation, can you share how you overcame it? Or let me know that I'll eventually improve if I continue to put in the effort? I don't want to give up so easily but I had to vent and look for some advice here. Please be kind to me! :)",1629506987,ctch42,13

I'm learning new words mainly with premade vocabulary Anki decks (a word on a side, translation and example sentences on the back). I suspect that the vocabulary is and has always been the limiting factor during my entire learning experience and I am curious about the whole word-learning process.

I'm wondering:

1. What methods do you know to learn new words? How effective are they? Do some become more useful or less at different stages of language learning? Do you use only one or combine them? Which one would you recommend the most?
2. Do you try to learn words bidirectionally (so that you can both recognize them and recall them) or only in one direction?
3. How many words do you think are needed to reach various milestones? For instance to be considered intermediate or advanced, to read an average fiction book, watch a movie or understand everyday conversations.
4. What do you think is a healthy range of new words to learn each day? An amount to learn a language quickly without running a big risk of burnout. (If you shoot a number or range, is it to learn words bidirectionally or only in one direction?)
5. Do you have any other tricks to share on increasing one's vocabulary quickly and effectively?
6. Besides learning new words what do you think are the other most important points one should try to work on? Did you ever feel like your limiting factor to learn a language was not the vocabulary, but something else?

languagelearning,Rosetta Stone is frustrating due to bad interface design.,"I just spend an hour trying to get past a single exercise. Farsi has invisible spaces that prevent letters from joining. (Imagine cursive, but you don't join certain compound words.) The people at Rosetta Stone have not actually tested their lessons because there are lots of places where there are two or more invisible spaces together.  There is no valid reason for doing that, it's an error!  It's also an error you can't see so this frustrating software flags the whole exercise as wrong but gives no useful feedback as to what's wrong. The software ""highlights"" the invisible space, which you can't see because it's invisible. So all you know is ""somewhere in this long sentence there is one or more hidden spaces that are invisible.""  You can't even test by trial and error because cut-n-paste does not work with the application.

To make things a bit extra frustrating, the sentences come in groups where the entire exercise is wrong if any part is wrong. So you need to type 4 long sentences that have multiple invisible characters correctly with absolutely no errors, or start over. It's the most fun I've had since getting a tooth pulled.

At this point I would take pretty much any other option for learning Farsi. It's very clear to me that no one at Rosetta Stone has done QA for this product and I hate using it. Getting stuck for hours on an exercise that should only take five minutes ruins the experience and sucks any possible fun out learning.

Suggestions regarding alternatives would be welcome.  

If anyone at Rosetta Stone sees this, then tell someone that the Farsi lessons are a disaster and desperately need some QA.",1629493908,IagoInTheLight,16

   2. Vowels are modulating when i'm speaking (like the Cow diphtong)

I have a Master’s degree in Accounting, and that took years to get and classes of slowly learning concepts and new vocabulary. There’s a lot of nuance in how things are described, and certain words can have different meaning in the profession vs how the average layperson learns them. I almost felt like learning this profession was like learning a foreign language, and it wasn’t until I had much practice that I could “speak it fluently” so to speak. I imagine it’s like this in many other professions! Well, I’m moving to Zürich, Switzerland and currently learning German (before eventually learning Swiss German dialect) &amp; am hoping to become fluent enough in German to speak about accounting topics in it.

languagelearning,Learning grammar - how do I integrate it into my daily life?,"Hello, I decided to improve my English. I thought learning the rules behind grammar would help. I am 21 (male) and for most of my life, I am used to just typing/saying what feels right to me. And usually, I am correct (Although I do mess up here and there).  
But I feel like it's absolutely necessary for me to know Grammar. For those moments I am making mistakes, and also to know how language works (sentences structure) so that I can excel in other languages that are similar.   


I just finished with Present Progressive. and I knew what words I should add ""ing"" to (some were surprising, but not a lot). I mean, I didn't know why, but I know their ""ing"" form if that makes sense. So I basically just learned when to use it. In what situation.   
How do I integrate it into my daily life though? Writing is easier because I have time to think about the situation that I am in. But talking? It's much harder isn't it? (My native language isn't English, so consider the fact I won't have that much practice speaking. Although I plan to find a way).

languagelearning,How do you properly make the jump to the more formal part of language learning? The jump just looks very extreme and it's killing my confidence and burning me out.,"For the sake of discussion, this is what I mean by formal and informal. For starters, casual spoken language is different from written formal language. Like what you'd hear and say in mundane conversations, tv shows, etc. would be different from what you'd read in news articles, magazines, etc. Second, informal in this case would be I get to choose which material I get to read, write, talk about, etc. rather than a random topic dictated by the proficiency test or the level dictating which words you need to know.

Most of my experience with studying Japanese for the last 8 years is on the informal side like talking with Japanese friends about mundane topics, watching anime, reading manga and light novels, sometimes playing games in Japanese, etc. The formal part of writing formal reports or the sonkeigo polite spoken language is something I've never had to do so it's something I've never practiced. While I sometimes read news articles in Japanese, I never read them with a magnifying glass with the intent of making a report about it.

While I was able to pass N3, N2 really kicked my ass. I absolutely had no idea what the reading passages wanted to say and it contained too many vocabulary that I did not know. It's a massive jump and the reading passages contained rather deep material. It's also worth mentioning that the Japanese Language Proficiency Test never tests speaking or writing so that's another reason that formal writing and speaking has been largely neglected. It's killing my confidence knowing that I can comfortably watch a lot of anime without subtitles, I can speed through manga but I have to bang my head against the wall to read and make formal reports about a deep topic I wouldn't normally talk about in my native language either. Like it's telling me that all the exposure I've gotten was all for naught because I chose to partake in media I enjoy and media that would be more relevant to my everyday life rather than drag my feet against the mud for the ""formal"" stuff I won't really need or I'm not interested in. I know that the formal stuff isn't going to be easy but is there any way to make the jump more reasonable? It feels too much like I'm biting more than I can chew.",1629353983,InsomniaEmperor,15

languagelearning,Can't hear the difference between L and R sounds no matter how hard I trained. Should I seek professional help?,"\*TLDR - I've worked so hard on the issue for more than a decade like Cristiano Ronaldo trains in football but nothing really works. Should I just accept the defeat, or seek out for really 'professional' help?

The title says it all but it's a long post - please bear with me as this has been tormenting me for years.

My background: I'm a Japanese native speaker and this has been the biggest challenge for me ever since I started learning English 10+ years ago. I've really worked hard on it but no amount of practice or training doesn't seem to fix it and I've been honestly at the point of refusing to believe any native Japanese speakers (who have learned to speak English as an adult) are really capable of overcoming this.

Over the course of 10+ years I did my undergrad degree and graduate diploma in English speaking countries, worked professionally in English speaking environment for 6+ years, acquired C1+ level certificates in multiple European languages, have been in relationship with an English speaking partner for years, English has been my primary language in daily life etc etc - the point is that I really don't think the lack of effort is the problem.

I've learned to pronounce the L and R fine but that's only because I've learned to do so by studying where to place the tongue and so on - I'm actually not even hearing the two sounds differently myself when pronouncing. In listening, I've obviously learned to cope by just knowing a lot of words (so that I can figure out which letter is being said from the context but I often find myself feeling clueless when it is a name of place or person that I've never heard of), looking at the placement/movement of tongue if I'm talking to someone. I can hear rolled R or 'more exaggerated' R in some languages but in English I find it much harder.

This has been honestly TORMENTING me for years and I feel it is massively hindering my language learning too as I always have to visually memorize how every word is spelled. And I feel so embarrassed every time I get it wrong.  

I've consulted with teachers and friends in the past but I feel so frustrated as they seem to believe if I attentively listen to minimal pairs 10000 times, one day I would be able to hear the difference magically. Admittedly I'm probably taking too much pride in myself as an 'experienced language learner' at this point, but I'm genuinely sick of being guided to learning materials aimed at A1 level learners, usually slow-speaking videos made by monolingual teachers who never had to go through the issue themselves - now I'm thinking this is akin to showing different colour panels to colourblind people and no amount of 'practice' will cure this.

So, as a last resort I've been thinking about consulting a professional speech therapist/linguist of sorts, only if someone specializes in this specific topic exists. My concern is that it will be incredibly expensive and so much effort for probably what is a miniscule ROI. Should I go for it, or should I just give up and learn to live with it for the rest of my life? Has anyone (probably native Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese speakers as I've heard they tend to have the same issue?) else been struggling with this, or managed to overcome? If so, how?",1629349122,TheKochInstitute,80

languagelearning,Am I in the wrong for being annoyed at a guy's pronunciation in my Ancient Greek course?,"Basically what the title says. I am currently in my second year of Ancient Greek and my class size has diminished to 5, including myself. I have this one classmate who is very book smart and generally excels in this course. My \*only\* problem with him is that he insists on using Modern Greek pronunciation when we're reading Ancient Greek passages. It is very hard to hear him read aloud, as he pronounces letters differently than the rest of the class. Even today, the teacher told him to say a word, then had to have him spell out every letter as he could not discern what word he was saying. My past two teachers that have taught this class have both not had problems with his pronunciation and have even been impressed with him. All of you linguists out there, am I being too nitpicky when I get annoyed whenever he ""pronounces"" Ancient Greek??

Why I think I'm justified: It's an Ancient Greek course, not Modern Greek. His pronunciation the majority of the time derails the class for about 30 seconds. We try and perfect our reading aloud skills, and he just makes it harder to learn how to do that.

languagelearning,Anki is actually so amazing. I never new.,"This is a bit more like a rant/story. I have been studying Mandarin for about 8 years independently (yes, I'm still not great at it and it is pretty much as hard as they say.)

However, I only started seriously committing hours to it about 2 years ago, and it's made all the difference. I have burned through several work books and hired a tutor and watch dramas a listened to podcasts, pretty much a little bit everyday.

During these times, I had heard tell of a mythical app called Anki, which was lauded as a language learners dream tool. At this point, I had no idea what SRS was (spaced repetition), I just heard ""Get Anki, Learn easy."" So I downloaded it and was... Unimpressed. I didn't really know how to control the information. I thought I HAD to make my own decks. It seemed like a lot of frivolous work just for some review. So I set it down and continued about my days.

Flash forward to a few weeks ago, I am still hearing all these things about a Anki, so I decided to give it another whirl, this time, with tutorials. Anki is a deceptively complicated program. All of your cards are shuffle-able into myriad decks, you can tinker and reorganize like crazy. The trick is to parse out the elements of the languages you want to learn.

Anyways, since I live in Taiwan, the proficiency test is called the TOCFL using Traditional Characters. Interestingly, there is a full 15000 word deck of all these words organized by level. Moreover, you can split the deck by level and learn things at reasonable interval!

Due to this discover and the functionality of SRS, I have expanded my vocabulary by about 300 words last week alone and have been able to find them in reading and listening EVERYWHERE!

I truly feel the level up, and I encourage you all to find find out which proficiency tests exist for your target languages. I guarantee an Anki deck exists for it and that you can RAPIDLY gain exposure to myriad new words and concepts.

AWARENESS OF SELF

Many years ago I became interested in the language of Korea - Korean. I knew a few phrases like 안녕하세요 and 네 or 아니요 but not enough to form sentences or converse with natives.

I didn't ask as to why, I just quit only to come back a few months later at an attempt to learn again.

After some deep self observation these past few months, I realized what I was lacking - and that is self awareness. When I studied a language, I would study it with the goal of being able to learn it fully in mind. However I did not try to find the process of learning it pleasant as I only stuck to the end goal which made me frustrated and want to give up.

Instead of being aware of my own body and mind and constantly reminding myself of the reason I learned the language I did the opposite. So it was very easy for me to say ""fuck this"" and move on.

I never saw learning another language as ""hard"" or something that takes months or even years to do because I learned English fairly quickly (2 months). Same with other languages, Thai, Chinese, etc, I realized that it's very easy to pick up on a language when you make the decision to do so wholeheartedly and by learning the alphabet/tongue positions (which is why many second+ language speakers have accents!)

With a strong ""ground"" or ""soil""/""bottom""/(whatever you call it) for my language path I made a decision - from this day forward I choose to be aware of all the choices I make, not just for languages but for my life. You see instead of constant living on autopilot I decided  to take ""control"" of my life by understanding that I cannot know a language by wanting to learn it.

So these past few months I've been living like that, with constant realizations throughout the day that I have a DECISION to learn a language which always bring me back to it. I've been studying Serbian for over 5 months and I can gladly say that I'm fluent in the language. I'm also learning Thai, Italian, Mandarin, Arabic, Khmer, Tagalog, and etc with good pronunciation but still working on vocabulary 😁

For me before, motivation was watching other people speak languages or encouragement from others to learn some language. Now I motivate myself by going back to why I wanted to learn because who's gonna do it if I won't?

Blessings to all and always go back to the reason for learning your languages. Once you have a stable belief that you CAN learn you will learn any language you wish with ease 🌟",1629325381,lucifer_7712,10

Ser vs Estar, Preterite vs Imperfect, Por vs Para. Back then, it was too hard for me. And well, what I regret now, instead of starting to study harder, I started French instead and immediately fell in love with it. But I regret Spanish. My Spanish is a weak B1 and my French is around A2. I know that if I leave French until I ""learn"" Spanish, I will forget it (French) immediately, but interestingly, I don't forget Spanish. But that is irrelevant. Do you think I should learn both at the same time? Or should I rather learn French first and then go back to Spanish?

languagelearning,Uncanny Valleys,"Do native speakers (not of English, or of other major lingua francas) feel uncanniness when they hear foreigners speak their language imperfectly?

As an English speaking American, I think we're trained to understand English at all sorts of imperfect levels and accents from people around the world. But I have had this suspicion that for native speakers of languages which are not widely studied by non-natives (probably most of the languages of the world, besides some of the big former imperialist languages ie. French), hearing someone speak imperfectly in their languages is difficult to understand and/or creepy. 

We all had that experience when we started studying our languages (not counting English), native speakers would praise us for speaking even a word or two in their language. But as we get better, do those native speakers, especially strangers, have a difficult time listening to non-native TL? I think it might be more than just the usual wish for them to practice English, or defaulting to English in an international situation. As if it's just so rare to hear ""bad Laotian"" or whatever language that the brain can't register it. 

And, in addition, has anyone ever met someone who speaks their languages *very* well, but not fluently? Is there an uncanny valley effect to that?

So I’ve noticed something about myself that I find kind of strange. I can speak English &amp; French fluently, but whenever I need to express my feelings—or when I’m sad—English comes first to my mind.

This one time I was crying because I was having an argument with my roommate (who speaks French only), and every time I would talk it felt like what I was saying had literally no emotions attached to it. My words felt kinda empty. It literally felt like I was translating my emotions into French, but it didn’t sound right. However whenever I thought about something I wanted to say (in English) I knew I could literally not even say any of those words cuz they would make me cry like a baby.

languagelearning,What are your most specific language learning tips for the languages you speak?,"When you learn a new language and its underlying grammatical structure, it seems like each new “milestone” is an ability to use more complex rules and patterns. What are some of these patterns, in the most idiomatic way to that language, can you describe? I’m wondering if chunking those pieces, in the most concise while most detailed way, applies among languages. Think it as a way to map universality of linguistic features.

For example, in Farsi the usage of verbs means that when two verbs are used, the first is in a present form with prefix mi- and the second one is in a subjunctive form with prefix be-.

Another example, from one language to another is from Spanish to Portuguese. When a word ends with the sounds “ble” in Spanish, it becomes “vel” in Portuguese. In the same way, “on” endings become “ao” and “les” becomes “is”.

What tips, among any languages you know, can you share?",1629310532,SuchSuggestion,81

languagelearning,SECOND LANGUAGE DILEMMA,"Hi folks, I need some advice regarding my English. English is my second language and I've been using mainly English for the better part of the last three years. I've never been to an English spoken environment or in a community. To better my English I quit doing everything in my first language except using it for dealing with basic needs and communication. English provides me with everything that I enjoy. For that reason, English has become a vocation for me. My favorite bands, writers, directors, singers, all of them are produced their works in English. I don't want to type a long post so I'll get into the dilemma. I'm so good at my first language since I read so many books, wrote so many poems and such in it. However, ever since I was able to do those activities in English I don't want to write in my first language. Since I'm inspired by English. By writing, I mean writing poems, songs, and some poetic prose. I do my best to work on my English but knowing perhaps I'll never be as good at English as my first, makes me think about gravitating towards my first since I can express, describe, create better in it. However, this thought seems to be too logical and practical. A utilitarian and logical approach. But my heart doesn't want it. I want to use English as a poet, as a singer, and songwriter. I know it is already tough to do these in your native language but as I said, I do my best. Besides, I don't think I could turn back to it. Back when I wasn't able to speak English I'd always read translated books, listen to songs in English despite not understanding the lyrics, and watching movies with subtitles. I was writing in my first because I had no choice. Writing is a need for me. A need to express and that happened to be a language that I was born into. Now I'm able to write in the language that I liked even when I wasn't able to speak.  Much obliged for any advice in advance.",1629303534,D3nbo,1

languagelearning,Dunning-Kruger effect among language learners (especially Japanese) is detrimental for the whole community,"I am a pretty privacy conscious person myself so I stayed away from virtually all social medias my whole life. However, during COVID, I decided to push myself towards better utilizing all the available free time and picked up learning Japanese. Being a westerner, I am unfamiliar with the script and at first, like everyone else, I was utterly terrified of Kanji. However, I slowly started progressing, covering new Kanji, words and grammar points. I am still at a very elementary level but for the sake of gathering resource, I started frequenting /r/LearnJapanese subreddit. Over the past couple months, although I found a great many helpful folks sharing lots of useful resources, unfortunately I also encountered far too much toxic elitism. I felt like this is one of the specific area where Dunning-Kruger effect is not only too visible, but it is also harming the general language learning community as a whole.

I also checked other language subs and various Discord servers and noticed that this trend is fundamentally most common among westerners, especially English monolinguals. YouTube channels like Xiaoma promotes a sham unrealistic timeline of ""acquiring"" languages and combining that with the English natives' obstinate outlook towards foreign script, it probably answers why Dunning-Kruger effect is endemic here. Many learners expect to magically become fluent by seeing these fake online stories and shams like Xiaoma (I don't know about Chinese but his other videos on Spanish/French were laughably ridiculous), and when they fail to achieve their goal, they rave on internet. Instead of blaming themselves, like the upright westerners they are, they blame others, i.e. the target language, culture and people. 

I cannot tell how many times I have seen on Reddit and Discord of folks claiming why it is better to get rid of Kanji in Japanese or switch Chinese to Pinyin. These people are, in virtually all cases, eternal beginners. They love to create their own Dunning-Kruger echo chamber and parrot whatever imbecilic reasoning they have for their uneducated opinions. When these folks rant on forums, blaming the language, they inherently discourage and misdirect newcomers, who may think their lack of ""magical learning capability"" is not actually their fault, but is a fault of the language itself. The most stupid matter is when folks compare languages like their T-shirts, without inherently understanding anything about linguistic.

I'm a french native and I've been watching animes since elementary school (japanese animes/games are really a thing here).
 At the beginning I wasn't interested in foreign languages so it was pure entertainment.
Anyway I began watching animes in japanese around 11 yo, 4 years later I began learning Korean quite seriously. As time passed I really had that thirst to learn new languages. Eventually, about 3 months ago I finally chose to study Japanese as my 5th language. As my Korean reached a satisfying level and being coucious of the existing similarities with Japanese I couldn't not try. During those 3 months I haven't been that consistent because...life. Still, I learned about 100 kanjis (probably forgot half of them 💀), some basic grammar, tenses from genki and basic vocab. Almost nothing! But whadda you know? It's 1am right now and for some reasons I decided to watch an anime in jp and turned on jp subs.
Listen, I am shocked to see how much Japanese I understood... It's like my brain was understanding things without me even putting in the effort. The sentences I understood are ones that contains grammar points I never looked up or even thought about. Which is why I was speachless: during all those years of exposition to the language (99%passive) my brain actually sorted out the syntax for me and created something like a mini database of Japanese??? During all those years because of repetition my brain treated Japanese like a puzzle to solve, like how cool is that?? That's so interesting! Just wanted to share these feelings. I know animes are nothing like what conversations japanese people have and I'm not saying I'm a genius and hacked the language. Just saying that I'm glad I exposed myself to Japanese for all of those years and because now the journey to learning it feels genuinely less foreign and frightening.

languagelearning,Seriously regretting my college major after discovering my love of language learning,"Language lovers of Reddit, 

A few months ago, I discovered my passion for language learning, and needless to say, I am OBSESSED. Although my current goal is to become proficient in Spanish, I am also learning Catalán via DuoLingo. I absolutely adore absorbing content from Spanish media outlets, learning the vocabulary and lexicon of this beautiful language. 

I wish with all of my heart that I could go three years back in time to my first year in college. I would double major in Spanish and Italian, pursue a career in teaching, academia, or government contract work. As a total Humanities nerd who spends most days in the library studying and reading, this would have been perfect for me. I know that I can learn languages outside of an academic setting, but taking languages at university via intensive courses and composition classes would have been so enjoyable and fulfilling. 

But its too late for me to change anything at this point. A few semesters into college, I changed my major from History to Nursing because I wanted ""predictability"" and ""stable employment prospects."" Although I regret this decision, I only have two more semesters left of nursing school, and jumping ship to something else would add 2+ years to my graduation timeline. Nursing is okay, but it's nothing like what I envisioned it to be, and it's not something that I am particularly excited or passionate about. I am greatly concerned about the potential strain this career could have on me physically and emotionally from moving patients and caring for people during the toughest periods of their lives.

I had been thinking of trying Malaysian as it has the Latin alphabet too which I figured would be easier. But one of my Malaysian friends told me it was useless learning it due to how few speak it globally.

languagelearning,Kids learning Chinese and Japanese at the same time,"I have an 11 and 8 yr-old who just started learning Japanese recently, and we are thinking to enroll them to learn Chinese next school year. We know it will be tough for them, but they don't seem to mind. We are not Japanese nor Chinese speakers, just English and our native language which is not remotely close to Japanese/Chinese. The reasoning behind this decision is that because we want them to start early and they still have a few hours extra free times (3-4 hours) in a week, so why not.

So my questions are:

* Has anyone been in a similar situation? I.e. learning both languages (or any multiple languages) around the same time. If yes, at what age?
* Any tips and tricks if you've been in a similar situation?
* What are the drawbacks? What to watch out for?

the different sounding ones from romanian are ""ur"" for 1, ""tint"" for 5, ""devet"" for 9 and ""deset"" for 10, the words for 9 and 10 are borrowed from croatian.But i didnt found the numbers for larger numbers from 11 to 100, now my question, how to say this numbers in istroromanian?can i use the same grammatic as for romanian numbers for istroromanian?example, 11 in romanian is ""*unsprezece*"" so translated to english its ""one and ten"", so in istroromanian it would be ""urspredeset"" right?15 would be then ""tintispredeset"" and 19 ""devetspredeset"".Numbers like 20 is in romanian is ""duazeci"" and 90 is ""nuazeci"" so in istroromanian it would be ""duadeseti"" and ""devetdeseti"" is that correct?",1629211117,apollon92,7

languagelearning,Learning Languages with Limited Resources,"I am currently learning Latin, which I have been studying on and off for years, by reading (I'm currently about half-way through Ad Alpes, whose language is probably at the intermediate level). After I started using LLPSI (essentially a reading course) and avoiding formal grammar about a year ago, I started to make great progress. I am interested in learning many other languages (Old English, Ancient Greek, French, German, Mandarin, Arabic, Tamil, Navajo, Basque, Georgian, Classical Nahuatl, Biblical Hebrew, Swahili, and perhaps something Celtic). For about half of those there are sufficient reading materials for beginners (I think I would use LingQ and readers), but how could I learn the rest? I have tried Jeff Brown's method for German and Mandarin, and it did work, but I found it to be too time consuming and inefficient as I had to travel to meet language partners and also had to help them with their English. I also had difficulty finding German language partners in London and there's no way I could find a Navajo or Classical Nahuatl speaker to help me. I much prefer to learn by reading; would I have to just find unadapted texts and struggle through them very slowly? Or would it be much more sensible to focus on the languages for which I can find materials? For some of them I could use Jeff Brown's method to get a foothold, but I do much prefer reading. I'm not really interested in any of these languages for practical reasons (apart from that I would like to speak Latin and Old English fluently); I am just a language nut who loves languages for their own sake.

You can compare languages to your own native language in the comments. 

Personally, I feel like the difficulty of Hungarian is vastly overestimated. I know it looks scary to a native English speaker because of the 18 or so cases, but when you find out what most of the cases actually are (basically postpositions) it's like the ""oooh scary 18 cases alien language"" just disappears. Its tense system is not as complicated as Spanish or Italian, it has no grammatical gender, it's pretty easy to pronounce and read, once you get into it it feels very ""logical"" like a lot of the things make sense because they're made up of smaller things that kind of fit like a puzzle.

languagelearning,There's a clear limit in how much new information the brain can take and retain in a single day.,"It's undeniable that vocabulary is the building block of languages and your mastery of a language is measured by the depth and quantity of vocabulary you know and how well you know them. Then you got a lot of language learners (me included) trying to rush language learning and trying to cram years of a native speaker's exposure into a few months. Combine both and you got people obsessing with SRS, memory palaces, optimal mnemonics, intensive language courses that try shoving a ton of new vocabulary in a single day, etc. since the urge to cram all that vocabulary and such in a short period of time is real. I myself experience this problem where I try to learn 10 new vocabulary words a day then eventually the reviews start piling up and stuff quickly slips out of my memory no matter how much I try optimizing Anki's algorithm.

Unfortunately, it takes a while to process new information and there's only so much new information the brain can take in a single day. The more new vocabulary you try to cram in a single day, the less depth you are able to absorb with each word. This leads to situations where I recognize a lot of vocabulary or at least feel like I've heard them before but I sometimes forget what they mean and I'm not able to properly use them because I haven't achieved that level of mastery yet.",1629087617,InsomniaEmperor,23

languagelearning,"People who started learning a language 10+ years ago, how have things changed?","I feel like it's been lost on a lot of people how much easier and easy access things are now. So some questions:

**What did you start with to learn? What didn't you have?**

**What did your first 3 months to a year look like**

**What are some things that exist now that kind of astound you in comparison to when you started?**

**What's the one thing that's new or more accessible that has had the biggest positive impact on you?**

When I started none of the oldest most popular websites/apps existed. I started before Anki, AJATT, Duolingo, Memrise... between my cousin and I we had a paper dictionary, a pocket grammar book, a phrase book, and Heisig's remembering the Kanji. And a few websites with very sparse grammar explanations. 

I've had 2 people now ask me how I didn't realize something was wrong after 3 months of study when everyone else was ahead of me, and I laugh because the only people ahead of me had spent years longer than me at it. My first 3 months to a year I was happy to know a bunch of nouns and have basic grammar down. I didn't have classes or anything to guide me.

I think things are WONDERFUL now. There's been a HUGE jump in technology and accessibility. I have a dictionary on my phone! I've got access to subtitles in my TL now with virtually no effort! (as opposed to spending $40-$60 for a DVD from overseas). There's an obscene amount of apps with course work and flashcard decks.

But now I have decided to get good at the things I want to be good at, and one of those things is that I want to be good at English. Because now I have started high school.

 About half of my English sounds good, just because I pronounce it the way I heard it (a bit like a baby learning) while the rest sounds crap. Anyway, you get pretty uncomfortable talking in class with that English. 

So now I started to learn English grammar(I don't really know how to learn it, so I am using this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVYfyTvc9KY&amp;list=RDLVAVYfyTvc9KY&amp;index=2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVYfyTvc9KY&amp;list=RDLVAVYfyTvc9KY&amp;index=2)

Then I am from Europe, and here you learn the British English accent, so I guess I would try to learn it. But how do you master (the sound of British English?)  The International Phonetic Alphabet or what it is called. this video shows how you say every letter or what you now call it. But how do you know what word uses what, like why is O in Hot and boring pronounced so differently, why? (maybe a bad example, didn't know what words to have as an example )I know how to say them, but I don't know why I say them like that

Apparently, Netflix has two versions of the show: if the language of your account is in English, the texts will be shown on screen in English but if your account is in German, the texts will be in German. This has nothing to do with the language that you choose for the dubbing, rather with the language of your account that you can change in your account settings.

######Week 6

**Monday**
So I guess it's time for an update on verb conjugation. I didn't find out much consciously, I realised that there is a separate form for 2PL that's distinct from 3PL
contrary to what I thought, same with the perfect and continuous forms, the former tends to end with -do and the latter with -ndo, and I noticed the existence of
what I call the hyopthetical form, because I don't know a general linguistic term for it, some examples include 'podria' and 'gustaria'. I have no idea about the actual
rules for conjugations, but I think I can conjugate certain verbs in the present tense. For example 'soy eres es somos sois son', 'se sabes sabe sabemos sabeis(??) saben',
'hablo hablas habla hablamos hablais(??) hablan' I think I can also recognise the past and future tense for the most part, but they are still fuzzy.


**Thursday**
It looks like the Amazon package tracker thing cickstarted my acquisition of the names of the days of the week, I still can't recall most of them, but I can recognise
them in context most of the time: the one that's similar to luna is Monday, the one that starts with a v is Friday, sabado(?) is Saturday and domingo is Sunday, two of the
others start with an m and one with a j I think, but I have no idea which of those is which.

I'm also starting to get the hang of the numbers, 0-10: cero uno dos tres cuatro cinco seis siete ocho nueve deiz, 11-05 are irregular: once doce trerce(?) catorce quince
and for other two digit number you make with 'name for the tens' + y + 'name for the ones'. 20 is veinte and 30 is trenta and I don't know the rest. For higher numbers
I think you just say the digit plus 100 1000 1 000 000 etc. which are ciento (sometimes just cien ?) mil and million respectively.


**Friday**
I am reading surprisingly slowly, it took me like 6 hours to read the first 100 pages of Harry Potter. On the bright side, I noticed that there are two distinct past tenses
as in 'estaba' vs 'estuvo' I'm not exactly sure what the difference is, but the latter feels 'closer' if that makes sense, so I'm gonna call it the recent past tense,
for example if someone says a good joke and you want to say 'that was good', 'estuvo bien' sounds better than 'estaba bien'. And with that I think I got all of the inflected
forms of verbs: present, past, recent past, future (e.g. iré), imperative (e.g. escuchen), hypothetical(e.g. podría), infinitive (e.g. caer), perfective (e.g. hecho) and
continuous (e.g. haciendo), plus different forms of these conjugated for the subject where applicable.

I used to think that there were also different inflections for different objects, but it's so much of an inflection as it is just appending me/te/lo/la/le/se/nos/os and
their plurals to the end or beginning of the verb. They are in a pretty straight forward correspondence with pronouns, except for 'le' which is used in place of lo/la
for indirect objects and 'se' which means something like 'one's self' in phrases like 'hide yourself'.

With that being said, I mentioned that this 'se' bothered me before along with 'ya' which is used similarly to 'already'. I didn't learn these today, it's just that
it's hard to pinpoint when exactly I learn something, so that by the time I'm sure I know it, it feels like I've known them forever.



######Week 7

**Thursday**
I started watching more Minecraft videos today and to my surprise, gameplays are not neccesarilly easier to understand than scripted videos about more complex things.
This is great because the Youtube algorithm is very good at making you waste your time, which actually works in my favor now, making immersion a lot easier.
This also means that I'm exposed to nontranslated Spanish for practically the first time, and it's not really aproblem to be honest, it doesn't feel any harder,
aside from the fact that I'm exposed to more accents, for example 'Miguel Gamer' has an interesting one where the main change is that he pronounces his y-s and ll-s
as an sh sound. I still find it a lot easier than European Spanish though. People also swear in English a lot, like 'what the fuck.' Although this might just be
because they are nerds. 


**Sunday**
I should mention that when giving my comprehension ratings, I'm not really thinking about it the whole week, I don't even remember my scale, instead, on Sundays or 
Saturdays, I ponder for about 30 minutes on each rating while immersing in that content. If the piece content I'm rating is shorter than 30 minutes (today should be first day that happens), 
that means I'll think about the rating for the whole duration of said content.",1629019673,faceShareAlt,10
languagelearning,"Italian dictionary + translations site like SpanishDict, Larousse?","Hi guys, 

I would like to start learning Italian on my own, and in the past when learning Spanish, apart from using the textbook and exercises, I really benefitted from working with a good dictionary site that also includes translations to English (when I am completely out of my depth) and conjugations. 

For Spanish, such a site is SpanishDict, for French I found Larousse. 

Is there anything similar for Italian? I cannot seem to find anything and it is getting me all kinds of frustrated as I find this to be an indispensable tool when learning languages now. 

(Bonus points if somebody can tell me about such a site for Romanian, but I understand that is such a niche language that probably really doesn't exist.)

I've been thinking about going abroad for college and the majority of the schools I've been looking at are in Germany. I'd obviously have to learn German if I were to go down this road which shouldn't be that hard.

I am already fluent in English as I have lived my whole life in England.
The remaining two are French and Japanese. I tried free mobile apps as I have no money to afford subscriptions since I'm a student (university in September).

I have a friend who knows 6 language and would be happy to speak to me in French but in terms of Japanese I really don't know where to start.
What I wish to know is how to successfully study and learn a language. Given my financial situation and upcoming university is it even possible? Should I wait till I have my degree then start studying or should I focus on French with my friend first?

languagelearning,Advice on getting back into learning my language of Choice (Japanese)?,"Japanese is my major and it’s a language I love, I love Japanese culture, media, history, they whole 9 yards. But ever since quarenteen I’ve been slacking in the Japanese department. I can’t even watch stuff in Japanese without it being a chore, me pausing and reading and not even paying attention to what is said (wich I know is horrible for language learning).

I’m going into my JR. Year of College, and last semester I got a C in my comunity college Japanese course, wich isn’t good. However when speaking to my professor, she said I was the best Japanese speaker she’s ever had, however, my grammar she said is a bit lacking in areas, especially with particles, and that I need to check for typos before I hand in tests. I’m transfering this semester and I will be on campus the whole time.

Recently, while getting in touch with distant cousins on my Ukrainian Grandmother side, I found out I have partial distant Japanese ancestry through my Grandmother’s mom’s side. And I might be descended from Japanese teachers in the Russian empire. Learning this fact got me even more motivated to learn Japanese, knowing about my newly found heritage in the culture. 

All day today I’ve been watching videos on language learning and language acquisition. So I feel this is a good step forward.

I do have a few conserns though

1) I will be on campus this semester and only have Japanese twice a week. I want to use the language as much as humanly possible, how can I achieve that?

2) I will be living on campus for the first time , how do I stay away from distractions?

3) Where do I start? Should I review grammar? Conjugation? The pages of vocab my old Japanese tutor tutor gave me when we read books and she would write down words I don’t know?

4) How can I relax in the language. I tried to play Pokemon in Japanese a while ago, but I haven’t really picked it up since. Not to mention when ever I watch something in Japanese I always have subs on, since I want to fully understand whats going on to talk about it with english speaking friends.",1628981673,CosplayThrowaway1015,4

Last year, at least in my country, a new exam type was introduced, the “Mediation Exam”.

For example, in the last exam, I must read an article that explained how to avoid Nedles Fear and then write an Email, summarizing the info of the article, to my friend Alice that needs to get vaccinated.   

The problem is that I don’t know exactly how should I study this exam. My school offers some models to practice and made some exams, however the number of exams is quite insufficient. Another method that could be interesting is make a writing and then summarize it as much as possible. What do you think about these methods?

languagelearning,How language learning changed me,"When I was 15, I was always a firm believer that English proficiency is an acceptable way to measure intelligence. I used to think of that for many years since I'm good at English.

Everytime I see someone make a grammatical mistake, I always find a way to correct them, sometimes not even correct them, but degrade them. I used to laugh at people making mistakes when speaking English. I was a very harsh person. Up to this day, I still think of every disturbing thing I have said. A year later, I came across at this one article entitled, ""Why you should learn a foreign language?"" and the rest was history.

I started learning Brazilian Portuguese as it was a Category 1 language. The whole experience was an eye-opener for me, to say that it broaden my perspective is a very big understatement. I used to ridicule people who are bad at English, with the help of language learning I got to reflect on those awful things I said. I had met my first online Brazilian friend through language learning, he was such a good person, encouraging and he's actually one of my motivations to learn it.

Learning Brazilian Portuguese made me feel vulnerable like a normal English learner would, like in a minority. I was once in a receiving end of degrading comments about my Portuguese skills and it hit me hard. Like really really hard, I lost motivation and the drive to learn it, gladly I recovered from it and still learning it. I reflected and reflected on it. Sometimes you have to be on the receiving end of what you've previously do to experience the damage it can cause. 

By that experience I became more sympathetic towards less privileged people and people I'm different with. After all the experience I had with language learning, I realized now why most monolingual Americans (US) are probably harsh towards the minorities because they never get to experience first-hand the adversities the minorities experienced and they're not open to other cultures and languages other than their own. There's no better way to connect with their heart other than speaking their language.

I actually think at some point on our life we need to atleast learn a foreign language, it can be a worthwile experience you will forever cherish. Now I'm 16, and it's crazy to know that after a year I can correct everything I was wrong about and change my perspective about something for the greater good. After all the things I have experienced, I'm glad one of it was language learning and I'm glad to be a proponent of wonderful possibilities it provides. Learning a language is definitely worth it, educate that mind of yours. Goodluck to your language learning journey! I hope all the best of luck to you all! 🤗",1628939128,RupertRobbed,82

languagelearning,An Idea for a YouTube Channel (with a caveat),"Let me start by saying that I know some of you reading this will think this is a bad idea. I have my doubts as well. I've asked one native speaker, and he thought it was a good idea. So I am putting it to the group to get your thoughts.

I'm thinking of starting a YouTube channel, and what I have in mind either doesn't exist, or it's simply not done often enough for me to find any examples. (Or it's a horrible idea and that's why no one does it)

I don't want to specifically teach the language nor do I want to give language learning tips — those are the two main types of channels I peruse. Basically, I want to practice speaking, and if I am going to be doing so out loud, I might as well have the camera rolling.

It wouldn't be just a Spanish vlog or a comprehensible input sort of gig, though that's the closest thing I can think of. There may be the occasional tip or whatever but mostly me reciting prepared scripts.

# Here's the ""bad idea"" part: I'm not fluent. Not by any stretch of the imagination.

I put my reading comprehension at an A2 or B1 depending on the text. My casual speaking is about as beginner as it gets...well, not that bad. I can say some stuff. But I'm definitely not confident. My pronunciation isn't bad (though not perfect), so if I have a prepared script, I won't necessarily sound like a native, maybe more like an intermediate learner with the occasional pronunciation slip.

Here are a few things I've thought of doing.

* Read a book meant for children (not necessarily meant for beginners though if I find one approved by a native, I wouldn't mind)
* Read a passage and break it down in English—this is most likely where any specific learning or teachable aspects might happen, such as how I remember the meaning of a certain word.
* The typical comprehension input video where a simple story is told (like Dreaming Spanish)
* Dialogs between me and my daughter
* Chats with natives (later on once I can hold a decent conversation)

# So, first of all: good idea or bad idea?

*Second, if it is a good idea—or at least not a completely horrible idea—do you have any other ideas for videos?*",1628928262,MasqueradeCrew,22

How do I know when I’ve properly learned it? Is this efficient? Is that efficient? Am I using my time effectively? Etc...

I need a structured, organized format...a roadmap. If there was an app that tested you through lessons, videos, exercises, etc...and finished off each lesson with a pass/fail quiz...that would be perfect. I feel like I have too many options, an app for this, an app for that, videos for this, books for that...and everyone says to go in a different order. Some say intense immersion, some say no don’t do that, do this instead...it all stresses me out. I start to think “what am I even doing? Am I really learning?”.

I know this post is scatterbrained but I started German recently and i feel like I’m not using my time wisely because I’m always jumping around. I have no plan of action, it’s all just “in the moment” learning. I need a roadmap, an efficient structure. Yes, I have duolingo, but it’s repetitive and boring to me. I need interactivity like videos and different kinds of exercises to switch things up.

When i was learning italian i took college courses on it, and I was eventually able to use exchange apps and that made everything better. But I don’t know much in German at all right now. And I don’t know where to put my time effectively each day to practice. General advice like “oh just do grammar” is too vague, again I end up wasting my time.

languagelearning,Question About Vocabulary Size by age,"So I was looking up studies about vocabulary size in native English speakers, and I found some odd stuff. The first I found was a study done by the site http://testyourvocab.com. In this site, [they have data about the vocabulary size by age](http://testyourvocab.com/blog/2013-05-08-Native-speakers-in-greater-detail). The problem with this study is that it was self-assessed and it doesn't differentiate active vocabulary from passive.

So I kept looking up other studies and found [this source](https://www.superduperinc.com/handouts/pdf/149_VocabularyDevelopment.pdf) that was mentioned in a Wikipedia article. It says that a 6 year old knows about 2,600 active words and 20,000-24,000 passive words. Then it says that 12 year old has a passive vocabulary size of 50,000 words. Now that seemed a lot to me and I was wondering if they had a different definition of 'passive' vocabulary (they call 'receptive' instead of 'passive').",1628898578,WasdMouse,5
languagelearning,Is learning Italian first the best basis for Moving onto other Romance Languages? Also is Italian (or the various languages of Italy) the closest of the modern Romance family to Latin?,"I was told by a few multilingual language that Italian gives a basic middle ground between all the romance language in that for example while a Spaniard will understand a lot of Portuguese easily without any prior study,  he'd have a much harder time with French and won't understand most Romanian basics.

Italian on the otherhand not only has a lot of similar pronunciation to Spanish in addition to word but also shares a lot in common with French structure and in addition was deemed on a quick google to be the closest language to Romanian of the Romance family. And its a big help plenty and plenty of other romance languages such as Sicilian are within the modern Italian borders and islands nearby Italy as well as also in regions cross Spain like Catalan and various islands and port locations in the Mediterranean that were major trading hubs dominated by Italian merchants in the Medieval Ages.

So plenty of people tell me Italian is the best starting point as a result of being in the absolute center ground if you plan to specialize in romance languages. And its a big help that Italy is the capital of Catholicism and most cultures with Romance tongues are primarily Catholic and that Italy is one of the economic superpowers of modern times.

It is all for this reason I was also told that Italian is the closest to Latin of the existing Romance languages in their current form. So I was told specialize in Italian first if you intend to go deep into Ancient Roman studies because its the closest (and it does't help Italy is where the Roman Empire's heartland was so you'd have to learn it anyway if you start Latin language as a hobby).

I imagine it’s generally easier to learn French from Spanish due to the similarities between the two languages and it would be useful to practice Spanish but I worry that it might be better to learn from English so I lose less nuance (I don’t want to learn French as a copy of a copy, so to speak). I also get the sense that there may be more resources for learning languages from English than from other languages.

languagelearning,The problem with language learners is they see what they're most comfortable with rather than that which is most effective.,"I used to be one to do this myself so I'm not just bagging on people here.  But the reality is, the harder something is for you to learn, when you do learn it, it sticks in the memory far more effectively than something which comes easily, something which doesn't tax us at all.  So to learn more quickly always challenge yourself, always seek the difficult path and trudge through it, you'll come out the other end with far more appreciation of the language and more pride in having worked so damn hard at it.",1628829687,OnlyANinjaCan,18
languagelearning,It takes a while to be comfortable with reading so ideally you want to practice with something that doesn't require you to look up words often.,"It's a common dilemma for us language learners when there is something we want to read in our target language but they contain a lot of unknown vocabulary. Even if you know every single word, understanding the meaning of the sentence or the passage as a whole takes effort. If you have to look them up or try guessing the meaning through context clues, that's additional effort and you'll be burned out before you know it. While being uncomfortable with uncertainty and not needing to know every single word is a sign of comfort and mastery with the language, the little holes in understanding because of so many words you didn't know adds up and you'll end up missing out on an important detail or two.

Another reason for this is reading speed. If you're used to reading stuff with a magnifying glass and looking up a lot of words you don't know or having to stop and guess what that new word means, you won't be able to read stuff at a normal speed as native speakers do. It's not a waste of time even if you know 100% of the words since reading them gives you additional exposure and reinforcement to those vocabulary.",1628827422,InsomniaEmperor,16

For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance,
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.

How charged with punishments the scroll,

What I've started doing is giving priority to Spanish, as I can practice easily, and that my progress is much faster thanks to it being a romance language. For 20 new words, I generally have only a few that I don't remember right after the lesson, and close to none after getting a skill up to level 5. I will be incorporating more methods to have a variety of Spanish input.

In the meantime, I also practice remembering and writing Kanji and complete Japanese words, for which I use Kanji Tree as well as a homemade spreadsheet.

For German and Arabic, I will just continue doing my Duolingo lessons until I can't progress just from that anymore, and give them a lower priority on days that I feel less motivated.

Does that seem reasonable? Any suggestions?",1628709178,Ultyzarus,6

This is not all of what i m doing but these methods are ideas i m thinking of implementing. 🤹🏽‍♀️

The Song Method, Receptive and Expressive Skills: 🎶

I m thinking of finding some French &amp; Chinese songs and reading then translating the lyrics into English. This is a way to get vocab and see grammar in action. I ll also listen to the song lyrics and sing to them so i can work on listening and pronunciation skills.

The Text Writing Method, Expressive Skills: 📰

I m thinking of making up scenarios that i will write about in the target language. Kinda like how in school u ve to write text about stuff. I think this will help with using specific vocab and tackling themes better. I also bought a Visual Chinese-English dictionary to help with vocab abd topic selection. The first method will also help with method vocab wise.

To put an example, the word ""set"". My native language is Spanish and in Spanish ""set"" has a lot of meanings. Seriously, too many. So it's sort of complicated to put this information in a flashcard so that I can't study it through flashcards. Most of the times, or course, I can perceive the meaning and the main idea of what people are trying to communicate. However, I do not want to have a vague idea of what something means, I would like to understand it as a whole.

As well as set, there is a bunch of other words with lots of meaning in my native language. So that's why if you had any advice for this sort of issue, I'd love to hear your suggestions. Thank you.",1628692932,santiorjuela20201,32

languagelearning,What are the best tools to turn words from sentences into something I can understand?,"I run into words in my target language that I don't know yet all the time and I'd like to get them *explained* to me (a translation, definition, image or anything to let me understand the word).

Copying the word into a dictionary or translator often doesn't work because many words in most languages have several different meanings or even composable forms. For example, ""turn"" in ""turn the lights off"" has nothing to do either with *a curve* or with *rotate*, but those are the main results you'd get from dictionaries and translators.

An option is to copy the entire sentence in a good translator, but if the sentence contains multiple words you don't know, or if you don't fully know the grammar it uses, it's going to be really hard to understand what's going on.

I'm looking for a tool that can take in a whole sence and *explain* single words from it. In the example above, I'd like to be informed that ""turn"" in ""turn the lights off"" is part of the phrasal verb ""to turn off"" which means to make the lights go dark.

languagelearning,"Would it be easier to learn a language I’ve heard all my life, pretty much everyday, but don’t speak?","
Question/short explanation: So basically my parents are both from The Gambia, and despite being from different tribes, mainly speak Wolof at home. My problem is that despite hearing it constantly, I really can’t speak it at all. I was born and raised in the US. My parents always spoke English to me and my siblings at home out of fear that teaching us both would “confuse” us. Would it be easier than learning a language that’s totally foreign to me? I took French for 4 years and I still can’t speak it so it kind of worries me. I’m too embarrassed to really immerse myself. I also fear that I would have a strong and noticeable accent.

Long explanation: As a child a I repeatedly asked them to teach me and I would basically get 1 of 3 responses: my dad would ignore me, my mom would laugh and tell me to say some random word(she thought it was funny?? Or maybe she’s just not a good teacher… idk she just never took it seriously) and then there is my least favorite response (also from my mother), who would say that one day she would send us there and I’d pick up on it. This was an acceptable response when I was 7, not so much now that I’m in my late teens and I still haven’t been there.

It’s not like they avoided speaking it to each other or to relatives so I heard it constantly. It really bothers me because it seems like basically all of my cousins and relatives are receptively bilingual at the very least. I am slightly, if I hear a conversation I could probably tell you what the topic is, but that’s it. It becomes more annoying and embarrassing as I get older because people in my community just randomly speak it to me until I reply in English or say that I don’t understand. They always kind of laugh or start talking to me like I’m a kid. It bothers me because I feel so… culturally isolated? Like I don’t have a culture.

I don’t want to ask my parents because my mom couldn’t teach to save her life nor does she think it’s a big enough deal to try. My dad gets mad every time I bring it up. They say they made a mistake and tell me to leave it at that as if it isn’t an ongoing problem for me. Wolof isn’t widely spoken enough to have many online resources.

Sorry this turned into a bit of a rant but the question remains lol.",1628672290,RoseThorne_,66
languagelearning,"Which language should i properly learn first, Spanish or Italian?","I lived in Spain for 2 years as i did my Master's degree, however I was too busy studying and ""living the life"" along with having all English-speaking friends (even the Spanish friends i had) made me just lazy about learning. My spanish is around B1 (maybe lower now as I haven't spoken any or practiced for over a year). 

On the other hand, I have an Italian girlfriend who i plan on proposing to very soon. Her family and friends speak no English (nothing to write home about at least) and therefore communication is and will be very hard, to say the least. 
My Italian is between A1 and A2, just from sponging things up from her, similarities between Spanish and Italian, and what I just guess based on context and memorize. I have never really practiced it or academically studied it like I did Spanish, basically bits of words that I somehow gel into a sentence (with abysmal grammar and structure) that conveys the gist of what I would like to say.

I would love to learn both as I plan on moving to either Spain or Italy once covid subsides or life normalizes a bit. I love both countries equally and finding a job in either requires me to know the language.

I am really on the fence about it, as I cannot really decide which to pursue or even begin with.

languagelearning,Is it normal to burn out and cap out at the more formal part of language learning? I seem to have reached my limit.,"At first, language learning is fun for me because it helps with travel or living in a country, allows me to make more friends, and allows me to enjoy media in that target language. Among languages I've learned, I've gone far enough with Japanese and Korean to be able to consume media, talk casually, and survive on a daily basis while I've learned enough Italian to be of use whenever I travel there. I wouldn't say I speak these languages, but I know enough French and German passively to know what I'm ordering and know what basic place names mean. There was enough sense of reward.

I'm planning on attaining at least level N2 in Japanese for career purposes and I'm studying and taking a class for it but now I'm realizing why it's burning me a lot recently and why I never got past intermediate level with Korean. It's the formal part of language learning where you gotta read, write, and talk about stuff you don't necessarily care about. It's no longer the phase where you can choose which media to consume or phase where you can tailor fit your study plan to fit your needs. It's no longer simply reading an article or watching something casually cause now you gotta be able to write about it formally and understand it in a deep level. You now have to sit through stuff that you don't need or care about. You have to study vocabulary that you're not necessarily going to use. This isn't really an issue with lower levels because the topics and vocabulary isn't as complex but it quickly reaches diminishing returns on higher levels.

It's an inevitable phase that I just don't think I have the willpower to push through since I'm not feeling the sense of reward anymore. I wouldn't feel this way if this was an immediate need like say if my job consists of writing formal reports in Japanese then the sense of need will kick in and I wouldn't feel like I'm just dragging my feet through the mud. I thought I can get around this or at least minimize the drag by exposure to a lot of media I care about (like maybe if I read enough light novels in raw Japanese it should be easier for me to understand and write about more formal articles) but nope. I get that when we were learning our native language in school, we had to go through the same formal phase of learning more formal vocabulary, reading and writing about stuff we don't necessarily care about, etc. but our native language is something that's essential in our daily life and survival and it's not something you can just run away from so there's at least meaning in the formal phase. 

How would you go about this? While I can't deny that I need a break, that's not going to make the path of formal phase any less of a drag.",1628660639,InsomniaEmperor,1

2.) A lot of you love to learn a ton of language and that the difference I would like to but it’s almost like i feel content.

languagelearning,There's a large difference in vocabulary I encounter through exposure and vocabulary that you have to know to pass proficiency tests. Is this normal?,"I'm studying Japanese and I'm gunning for N2 in the Japanese Language Proficiency Test which is the 2nd highest level. I supplement my studies with a lot of anime, manga, light novels, random news articles, etc. I get that anime and manga have more casual speech, light novels use more formal vocabulary and grammar, and full blown novels, newspapers, essays, etc. use much more formal language. Now the big dilemma is, a lot of the N2 level vocabulary don't appear in the stuff I read or watch. They're essentially stuck in Anki hell where I just don't encounter them outside my Anki reviews or looking up sample sentences where those words are used. Meanwhile, the vocabulary I commonly encounter in exposure seems far more useful yet not really that helpful when taking practice tests or the like.

How do you go about this? The big frustration for me when I took N2 2 years ago was that there's just a ton of vocabulary I just don't know. I have to have a huge arsenal of vocabulary just to pass the test so it's incredibly tempting to put them in Anki because I just absolutely have to know these vocabulary. Of course that alone isn't enough so I supplement it with exposure to actual material but again, the issue is when there's a large difference in vocabulary for both cases. Had the same issue with Korean too where the vocabulary I encounter in tv, radio, music, etc. is vastly different from vocabulary for higher level proficiency tests. This might not be an issue in lower levels where basic vocabulary can be more easily found. I can't help but feel like focusing heavily more on exposure is more productive than focusing on the test material.",1628497807,InsomniaEmperor,9

So this is my problem: For getting better at English I read books. One series that I like a lot is Terry Pratchett's Discworld. I read some years ago several of them, but in my native language, and some months ago I read two in English. 

The thing is that not all the characters speak gramatically correct, and sometimes they spell things horribly; Terry does this to express that they are incultured or whatever. And here is where the problem is. I stopped reading more books of Terry's in English because I feared myself starting to adopt that broken speech of those certain characters, and above all that some mistake of the kind slip past by my awareness and think that it is correct (when it is not). I really want to read him in English, but I stilll got that fear within myself. 

Has my fear some logic or am I totally overthinking this and worrying because of nothing?

Thank you in advance.",1628409222,Xavier_Carax,7

languagelearning,Apps &amp; Services that offer lifetime membership for multiple languages,"I know this isn't an ""app shopping"" reddit, but in reality it seems that we end up looking for and going through various different apps and websites/services throughout our language learning journeys (which is also helpful and fun in itself).

Especially once you fall in love with learning a foreign language, i think many of us start looking for another language or culture/country we're interested in and would like to keep going if possible (hence there, one of the practical constraints become the money you need to pay for each language app/lesson series per month or year). 

So i thought it could be a good idea to have some idea about which apps offer multiple languages with lifetime subscription options. Granted, ""lifetime sub"" isn't as useful when you're only learning one language, since for most services, we'd rather want to go beyond what the app can help us with (at least at this point in technology). But i think it does have good value once you use the app for other languages too, even if it wouldn't take you  further than intermediate level.

I'd like to have some list of such apps for my own future use, and thought it can also be helpful for some other people, especially if you like it as a life-long hobby.

I'll start with some i've found so far as i tried or checked out other apps, and i hope some people could add more to the list. I won't write down how much each service is, since those numbers can change with time and region. I think we can probably find good deals during times like Black Friday sales once we know which apps offer subs we're interested in.

So here are some i've found:

\- Babbel (multiple language sub available at higher price than single language option). If i may add a little description, i think this one is good for beginning and having a solid grasp/understanding of a new language. I've used it for a less popular language (not FIGS), and appreciated what it does, but didn't seem to help that much beyond that level. Perhaps some people who've used this one for the popular languages can chime in and let people know if it's also good for higher levels.

\- Clozemaster.    (Sidenote: Lifetime sub price seems to be a bit over twice the annual sub and seems to be the case for most other services also)

\- Speakly   (doesn't support many languages, at least not yet. Has some interesting offers like Finnish and even Estonian though if you're so inclined)

\- Drops  (personally found this one really fun to use in spare times, and not stressful while learning new words in a way that sticks. However, i'm not sure if subscribing is really necessary for this app yet. Might be worth it at advanced level)

\- Memrise (This is a big one that i'm yet to try. Would like to hear if this is really worth the money and time)

\- Busuu (another big one i haven't really tried. Would love to hear some opinions as well, especially if you've tried lifetime sub)

\- Pimsleur (lol..  j/k  'lifetime option' is indeed there)

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's all i know of. Apps aside, i think Youtube and Anki (depending on people) are really, really helpful and not to be neglected. Youtube, i think, becomes much more helpful once you're at an intermediate level or above (aside from some free beginners' lessons). 

I hope we can have some additions to the list above if you'd like to share (and your experience with it if you have).",1628401336,asti27,5

languagelearning,Studying Several Languages at Once: The Pros and Cons,"I know the community is divided on this topic, but it's a question that pops up so frequently here that I want to share my personal experiences with learning several languages at once:

The Pros:

\-&gt; I don't have to decide which language to focus on first.

\-&gt; Since I'm at various levels in my languages, I can adapt my studying to my current level of focus and energy (e.g. watching something in French, where I'm already C1+ in listening comprehension, is much easier than working through a textbook chapter of an A1 language where most of the stuff is still new and possibly confusing).

\-&gt; If I need a break from one language, I can just switch to another one for the moment and still continue studying.

\-&gt; Cross-linguistic reference, e.g. comparing similarities and differences in grammar aspects or ways to express something, can actually reinforce learning them in both compared languages. 

\-&gt; I love learning about how different languages work, so learning several at the same time satisfies this curiosity way better than learning them one after the other would.

\-&gt; Learning more than one language at a time feels natural and like nothing special to me since it is expected from German students in school and I grew up with it being normal.

The Cons:

\-&gt; Progress in each individual language is slower (assuming you compare spending the same amount of time on one language versus on several languages). Take Icelandic, for example: I started it about a year ago and am still somewhere around A1, I'd say (except for reading comprehension, which is probably at A2+ by now). Had I spent the entire amount of time focusing only on Icelandic, I'm sure I'd be at a solid B1 by now instead.

\-&gt; Interference. This isn't unique to learning several languages at once; in fact, some amount of interference is normal as soon as you start learning a second language (whether it's more than one native language, or starting your first foreign language). But it's probably more noticeable if you switch between languages for a long time while studying, especially if two or more languages you're studying are very similar to each other (say, Romance languages, or Dutch and German). Be prepared that, while your INPUT usually benefits from the similarities, your OUTPUT will likely have a lot of interference at first and it can take quite a while for your head to sort them apart, and potentially require a lot of effort on your part. So if you have some important event in one language coming up, say, an exam, consider taking a break from the other, interfering language(s) for a little while beforehand.

\-&gt; Choice paralysis. Sometimes, when I want to start studying, I can't decide what exactly to do because there are too many tempting choices...

\-&gt; Use it or lose it, meaning you need to use all your languages kind of regularly (the amount and time frame may vary from person to person) or some of your progress will get lost (mostly active skills in my experience, while passive skills, in my case, stayed mostly intact even after a ten-year break for some low intermediate to low advanced languages). So naturally, the more languages you are learning/have already learned, the more time you need to spend in order to prevent losing them. This, again, isn't unique to learning more than one language at a time, but lower-level languages get lost faster than higher-level languages.

I invite civil discussion and am actually interested in hearing other people's experiences, but please refrain from claiming that ""it's not possible to learn more than one language at a time"" since I've been doing exactly that for over two decades now, and there's tons of people around the world successfully doing the same.",1628385781,Miro_the_Dragon,33

French speakers like to pronounce words in strange ways. For example, they often say **pt'être** instead of **peut être.** You would have a hard time recognising it if you never heard it spoken like that before!

We're doing an academic research study on language learning algorithms. This app helps you actively practice your listening skills from native speaker videos. The goal is to help bridge the gap between what you study and the 'real world'.

Instead of passively watching YouTube videos, the app asks you questions that force you to pay attention. That way you learn better! Each question consists of a short video clip. You have to select the right option that corresponds to the missing word, by paying attention to what the person says.

languagelearning,Disentangling Romance Languages,"I feel like I'm in a bit of a pickle... I'm about B1 in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese.

This is part of what's allowed me to keep learning this hard language for the last few years.

Anyone else notice this helpful effect in learning a language?",1628284620,Rigel444,63

languagelearning,Trying to speak early in learning a language,"Ladies and gentlemen,

Does trying to speak freely with a native early in the language learning journey, let’s say by A2 level, affect negatively the speaking skill by creating early wrong patterns that would be hard to get rid of even when you reach an advanced level? Or does the speaking skill improve over time as you learn actively the language and practice free speaking regardless of the mistakes you make early in the process. 

In my case, I started practicing speaking somewhere in A2, then continued doing so for around a year now. My level at the moment is mid B2. Of course my speaking skill has improved enormously since I have first started. However, I still make mistakes while speaking especially when it comes to gender and grammar but  the difference now is that more comfortable, can effectively deliver the message, and use wide range of vocabularies. My concern is that if I continue practice speaking (around 3-4 hours a week) I might reach a level where I’m too comfortable and stop trying to speak correctly and the mistakes I usually make become a habit. 

Thank you",1628278299,EthEnth,15

languagelearning,Pronunciation practice advice?,"So, I’ve recently started learning a new language (Korean), and I’m trying to get a grasp on pronunciation and reading first. I’m not necessarily learning the vocab or the grammar, but instead trying to learn how to say/read things correctly so that when I do learn them, I feel confident that I am saying most things correctly in different contexts and can more so focus on the words and grammar at hand. However, it’s a little bit difficult to grasp the many rules and I’m not sure how to go about it? I’ve done practice worksheets for each rule and have taken time to look up videos to get a better grasp, but when I start reading it’s hard to put all the rules together without forgetting some or suddenly getting confused. Especially since Korean has rules where spelling and how its said can differentiate, I get mixed up a lot.

I’ve already been practicing for a few weeks and have made sure to grasp the alphabet first. I feel confident with that, but I’ve been having trouble memorizing the pronunciation rules, despite taking separate days to really learn each one.

languagelearning,"Trying to move from intermediate to advanced, are these good techniques?","I've begun reading books for young adults that I have about 80% comprehension of. Some of the books I stop and make flashcards of every word/phrase I don't know. The others I just read and try to increase my ability to understand through context.
I do the flashcards pretty regularly (anki), but don't know how much they would help me in using the word in speaking instead of just recognizing the word in reading.
I've also started listening to some more advanced (faster, thicker accents) material, like Ted es Español (about 85%comprehension). I'll re-listen to an episode many times to see what I'm missing and look up words I don't understand.
I've been taking a conversation class which has really helped me understand where I fall short (vocabulary, using the subjunctive).
I have a lot of time at work to listen to podcasts, so I listen to intermediate stuff (Unlimited Spanish, Duolingo- 98%comprehension) mostly because those have better recordings and are easier to hear. However I don't feel like they're helping me at this point and are really just for entertainment. I really like the grammar tidbits in Coffee Break Spanish, but the volume between speakers usually varies so dramatically that it's hard to listen to while I'm working.

I've been learning Russian for 8 months and I'm well on my way to B1. I can understand the majority of the beginner content I listen to, and I use LingQ to read along with the audio and translate unknown words to bolster my vocabulary. With all this being said, speaking is incredibly difficult for me.

I've just started taking lessons with a tutor and the practice is definitely helping, but I still feel like there's a rift between what I can understand while listening/reading and what I can actually produce while speaking. Even writing is hard for me because the grammar is so difficult with all the different cases.

languagelearning,An English book that won't make me want to die,"Hi guys.
I'm a Ukrainian student now, and I have been learning English almost all my life, but to be honest my skills are pretty low anyway. I learned it in the school well, but not more than it was required. I think the reason is that... I HATE English. I hate the fact that I need to learn it, but still.. I actually need to.
I want to break this walls I built around myself. I want to break myself and love this effing language cause I can't live on like this.
Today I want to ask for your guys help. My English teacher in university gave us an optional task: to translate a book. It should be not very big, like 100-300 pages, as he said. I totally ignored this all the academic year, but now I'm feel like really motivated to do so. I'll force myself to do this. I even think now about writing something in English by myself, but translating book first.
Could you guys please advise me some fiction book that won't be too difficult to understand (for me as a Ukrainian) and not very big as I already said? Let me explain: I had translated a couple of books a few years ago, but it was a really old XIX century literature so I didn't stand it after ten pages. One more book I tried to translate was a ""bestseller"" by some psychologist, it was kinda about family sth like that, and it consisted of VERY long and complicated sentences. Even my elder bro who is really cool in Eng was pop-eyed with that book. Oh and I translated a couple of stories by Isaac Asimov, and it was not bad, but it was distopia about distant future, I guess it's not that genre that I like. So about a literature style.. I will be very glad to read n translate something like Jack London stories, although I don't know how difficult he's style in original is. Or something like Alexander Green stories, but he already was writing in russian hehe.
It will be great you to share your experiences in translating English books by yourselves (especially if you are slav like me).
So.. thanks for reading, I'll be waiting on your advices and books :)

1. Those who really want a native-like accent, but recognize that it's extremely difficult (perhaps even impossible), and learn to accept that having a foreign accent is okay.
2. Those who, even if given the chance, wouldn't want a native accent because they see it as an identify issue. ""Why would I want to sound like a native Korean if I'm a Swede, born and raised in Sweden? It's like pretending to be someone I'm not"". 
3. Those who genuinely like their foreign accent because they think it sounds cool and/or sometimes even cute/sexy to the opposite gender.

languagelearning,Need Help With Listening Skills,"I've been studying Russian for a while now and I still have trouble understanding things that are spoken. I have hypothesized that the reason for the lack of understanding is not vocab but the cohesion of certain sentences, for example ""Как Получится"" from my understanding is ""it depends"", however the translation for как is ""how"" and ""gonna work"" is from Получится. Do I have to study sets of words to understand the meaning? Keep in mind, if I listen to a podcast or something and hear ""Как Получится"" I'm instantly going to try and translate it into English in my head, which would probably take a second or two, but then it wouldn't make sense so I would have to do a double take and remember that this set of words means (Fill in blank). Trying to remember just these two words would take like 4 seconds and by that point the podcast/TV would have said another 10 words by that point. People also say that they've learned a language just by watching YouTube videos and studying some grammar. How does everyone translate a language in your mind? When you hear a word do you automatically visualize it and know what it is in a second? My Russian speaking skills are far better then my listening skills, this is a problem because I can't really use my speaking skills if I don't understand and can't have a conversation. I guess overall I would like to know how you all translate words so fast in a face to face conversation, what listening exercises best worked for you and if anybody else has had trouble like this and found some information that turned it around.

languagelearning,"Has anyone successful learned a ""heritage language"" to an advanced level (C1/C2), what have your experiences been like?","So I grew up completely in Australia but I have an Indonesian background. Since I was not formally educated in Indonesia and really put no effort speaking the language from ages 5 until 17ish my formal Indonesian was almost non-existant until I started learning myself. I started learning Indonesian really lazily 4 years ago but have been going hard this year. I don't know where I am now but I definitely should be at a high level according to the teacher of an Advanced Indonesian class I took in uni one time, I don't think I'm a C2 yet though.

So far, it's a bit frustrating that I can't prove to people I can speak in Indonesian. Whenever I speak with my parents they always say things like ""you probably dont know this word"" or they think everytime I misunderstand a convo, it's because of my Indonesian skills, which is annoying because I tend to take a while to understand things regardless of language lmao.

Whenever I speak to new people, they always ask me if I know this saying despite already speaking native-level Indonesian to everyone else. Most of the new and sophisticated Indonesian words I've learned are also formal words that I can never showcase in front of anyone. So despite putting a bunch of effort into learning Indonesian, I'll still be always put in the category of kid who grew up in Australia that only knows a smidge of Indonesian.

languagelearning,Why is it that Romance languages are less difficult for native English speakers to learn than German?,"I've taken both German and Spanish classes before. My first was German, for around 5 years. 

I found German pronunciation a lot easier to pick up than Spanish. Sounds like /x/ came easier to me than most because I focus on pronunciation a lot. Once /x/ was down it was relatively easy to learn /ʀ/. The umlaut vowels were all taught to us in the span of several days and we had learned them pretty quickly. 

Being able to do a German trill helped a lot with picking up Spanish /r/, but even then it took a lot of practice. It's still difficult for me to articulate it quickly in when it comes after certain sounds. I find Spanish orthography more inconsistent than German- labials change depending on the letters around which can be confusing. Another problem for me was Spanish g, which often confuses me whether or not I should see it as a silent letter or as an /x/. 

But for some reason, Spanish grammar is a lot more penetratble for me than German ever was. One less gender to worry about meant that there were tons of conjugations I don't need to learn. There are only four versions of the word ""the,"" adjectives only get conjugated for gender/number, and as far as I know weird word order changes/variability are less common in Spanish. 

I know that German vocabulary is supposed to be more recognizable for English speakers, but I think that Spanish vocab was easier to learn. 

I wonder why German grammar is more difficult than German. I've heard that, since German and English are more closely related, their grammar should be similar. Actually learning German, though, grammar was often super strange and seemed alien to me. This was a lot less common doing Spanish. 

So, German learners, what do you think about this? Do you also find the grammar frusturating? What issues did you run into? 

Spanish learners, do you agree with me that Spanish is an easier language to pick up? Am I too early in the learning process to make a judgement like that? What problems did you have to overcome with Spanish?",1628212772,synthpop1917,23

We're hard at work building features for our beta launch, and we wanted to get some input from the language learning community.

We've got a few quizzes created for the app (and a statistics page to analyze them, which we may split off to another page):

https://imgur.com/a/p52JHek

We want to have several configuration options for tests (for example, letting you choose between your own list of words, an skill level (HSK/A/B/C levels etc), and just going wild and getting random words from the dictionary)

Some of these test options could be global per test - for example, if you choose skill level 3 words, we could make it so that all tests that can work off a list switch to skill level 3. That would mean less work for you.

Alternatively, you might not want that - for example let's say you're really good with the matching game, but you have a lot of trouble with multiple choice. You may want to switch to skill level 3 words for the matching game, but leave them on skill level 2 with multiple choice.

So what do you like better? More granularity, or greater ease? Or do you want us to try to figure out a way to let you do both (which may make the app more complex to learn how to use)?

languagelearning,Approaching languages with way less cognates,"Hi. I'm interested in hearing about any tips you guys have for languages that are linguistically a bit less related to English and therefore are harder to learn simply through input and immersion.

When I would read in French and Portuguese I never noticed how many words I would pick up just by seeing them a couple times; I didn't even need to look them up - words like *confortável, punível,* or *conteúdo,* that either looked like an English word or shared some sort of root or base with an English word.

However, when I was studying Hungarian and dabbling in some Slavic languages, I felt like I would try to read and pick up a few words just through context or repeated input or something, but the messages just never made it into my head. Obviously I know not to get too hung up over words that I don't know, so I usually just move on and try the next sentence, which leads to the same result. I felt like I was putting in double the mental effort and getting less than half of the reward.

languagelearning,Readefine - Reword the Internet,"Hi there,

I recently built a browser extension called Readefine that lets you reword the internet. Check it out: https://www.getreadefine.com

By default, Readefine automatically simplifies thousands of words and phrases, but you can also create your own personal dictionary or contribute and use community dictionaries that reword certain domains - it's even used for passively learning the vocabulary of other languages (members of the community have created Spanish and Numu, or Paiute, dictionaries so far), sort of like Toucan, but created by members of the Readefine community.

Readefine is available as an extension on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge, and it's also available as an iOS Safari extension if you're on the iOS 15 Beta. You can download it on your browser at https://www.getreadefine.com/installreadefine",1628197002,anlinguist,4

I know Google Translate, it is a very useful tool. But today I searched in Google for ""querying pronunciation"" (my mother tongue is Brazilian Portuguese, and I'm improving my English).

If you search for ""&lt;anything&gt; pronunciation"", Google will show a box where you can listen the word, and while listening you will see lip/tongue movements, you can listen also in slow motion, and the best feature I see: a ""Practice"" button. Clicking, it will record your voice speaking the word and it will say if you said correctly, and if not, it will give clues like ""it looks you said xxx instead"" or ""Good Job"".

languagelearning,Olly Richards Short Stories in Icelandic--Review,"The book (I used the Kindle ebook) contains eight short stories that greatly differ in topic and setting (and some are written in the present while others use past). It claims to be at CEFR level A2-B1. Each story is divided into three or four chapters, with each chapter being followed by a brief summary and comprehension questions (all in Icelandic), as well as the vocabulary deemed too difficult (typically about a Kindle page full, translations given in English). Each story is also preceeded by a full-page illustration setting the tone for the coming story. On my Kindle app (on smartphone), each story contained about 25-30 pages of text. I needed about 60-90 minutes per story.

What I liked:

\-&gt; the stories, albeit written in simple language for learners, were actually quite entertaining, some more, some less

\-&gt; the Kindle app makes it very easy to look up words and whole phrases (the translator--needs internet connection--is hit or miss for individual words but was fairly good for longer phrases), which is  a HUGE help for a particle-verb-heavy language like Icelandic (you can know every single word in a sentence and still have no clue what the heck it means...)

\-&gt; the variety in topics and settings exposed me to a greater variety of vocabulary

\-&gt; the language was descriptive enough that I was able to ""see"" the stories in my head, aka create mental images of the scene and people

\-&gt; I liked having both stories written in the present and stories written in the past to get accustomed to both narration styles/verb tenses associated with it

What I didn't like:

\-&gt; I would have liked the answers to the comprehension questions following the questions and not being bundled in the back of the book

\-&gt; (this one's probably totally on me, not on the book!) the selection of given vocabulary help was sometimes a bit strange as I ended up looking up a lot of other words but knew quite a few of those he gave translations for

\-&gt; even after finishing, I'm still not sure whether the stories were sorted in increasing difficulty or were totally random...

What level do I think my reading comprehension is now?

Definitely NOT B1! I had to look up far too many words and sometimes whole phrases to say that I was comfortably able to read the stories. I would say, though, that it's probably A2+ by now as there were also a lot of parts I could read quite fluently (especially towards the end of the book), or words/phrases I looked up only to get confirmation that I guessed correctly.

Summary:

I can definitely recommend this reader. One big warning for those learning more than one TL, though: I was considering getting one of his other readers as well, only to realise that, based on the titles, the other book contains the EXACT SAME STORIES. Which...I mean, the stories were entertaining enough to enjoy my read-through but not good enough that I'd want to read them several times over in different languages...",1628120489,Miro_the_Dragon,6

I am aware it's a little unusual but the only reason the thought of doing this crossed my mind is that I've already finished learning most basics of both the languages and I'd probably self-diagnose myself to be at A2 in both languages. 

I'll also have to start with basics in the said college courses because they don't accept students like me who ,,self-studied their way through basics and claim to be at A2” so there's no way they'll let me skip the certificate level and take admission in the Diploma course instead.

Only thought of doing this because having covered the basics of both languages myself, it shouldn't be too hard for me to manage both at the same time (at least, in the A1/A2 aka certificate level). Would love to know your thoughts on this.",1628079246,questavoce,10

languagelearning,Goodreads for language learners - suggestions and feedback on comprehensible input finding concept appreciated,"As an intermediate language learner, I often find it difficult to find longer-form native content that I can read at an extensive or intensive level. Children's novels are frequently topic-specific and I'm well past the graded readers.

This leaves me sifting through tens of downloaded webnovels and running them through some of my analysis programs - and even then, I've had to drop books a few times, whether out of boredom or difficulty.

So, I've been thinking of coding up an app/site to help address this issue - somewhat similar to Goodreads, but with more features targeted for language learners. Before I dive into making it, however, I'd really appreciate any feedback or suggestions so it can be the best tool possible! Also hoping to clarify what feature path would be the most useful for the community.

One approach I thought of would be to have a Goodreads-esque community where language learners can post books they've read, along with reviews and ratings. There would be a number of ways to assess the book in order to build up a useful profile for it - such as its CEFR difficulty, length, how gripping the storyline was, lexical richness, etc. This could potentially be extended to shows, native websites, and so on. The tool would then suggest books for users based off of their library. However, the pitfall I see here is that of community engagement and size - is this something you think you would use? A very sizable userbase would be needed to make the concept work.

On the other hand, I'm considering doing the same as the above but on a larger scale by keeping track of the raw text of audiovisual resources. The rating system would be the same, but texts for the books, articles, shows' subtitles, etc. would be stored by the system. By allowing users to input their known vocabulary (through flashcard imports, based off an online test, their previously read books...) this could be compared to the books' text, augmented by the rating system, to create a readily available list of native resources at the right level, and even build up a 'map' of sorts that would suggest progressively more challenging content.

I'm most excited about this second route and would love to build it, but am just worried about legal or content issues not being a lawyer; while there are a decent number of free, copyright-free books on the web, they're often difficult, old, or frankly boring. This approach would work slightly better with articles or shows since the text is available freely, but books are the best medium due to their length and popularity. While, at least for Chinese, there are sites which have existed for years hosting thousands of books, I'm not sure if I could run into trouble linking to those or storing book text files for analysis - even if just for internal use, having users buy the content themselves. Unfortunately but unsurprisingly, e-book selling platforms don't seem to offer the option to access book data.

What do you think of this sort of language-learning tool? Any thoughts on useful features or ways to create a large library of accessible content without licensing issues that could bring the site crashing down? I'm hoping to be able to create something that will benefit learners like me, so any and all feedback, suggestions, criticisms would be greatly appreciated.",1628060341,LAcuber,6

Language learning apps claim their app is the best way. Anki aficionados claim that spaced repetition learning is the most evidence-based way to memorize things (which I think is reasonable).

Jeff Nippard is an exercise youtuber focused on teaching the ""science"" of working out in an approachable/parse-able way.

Spanish sounds very clear. I feel that if I don't understand something, it's because I lack vocabulary, not listening skills.

But I love the sound of French (dubbing is also very good compared to Spanish) and enjoy the fact that French shares so much vocabulary with English, more than Spanish. French is also more profitable, both in my country and as a language of countries I might want emigrate to. Unfortunately, listening comprehension is very hard, so hard that I lose hope that I'll ever learn the spoken language.

languagelearning,How do you feel about forced output? Is it effective?,"One thing that's bothering me about my current Japanese class is there's a bit too much output in what the teacher has us do everyday and in the homework everyday and not really enough input in the way of reading or listening. Here's what the teacher asks us to do when we go through new vocabulary words.

1) Provide a Japanese definition of that word.

2) Use that word in a sentence.

If I'm learning a word for the first time then I wouldn't know what it means, much less provide a definition of it in Japanese or even use it in a sentence. Even if the teacher does tell you what it means, that's still not enough info to be able to properly use it in a sentence.

Another thing that bothers me and why it comes off as forced output for me is the homework everyday where it's either we write about something or make a presentation on it. That something is always some random topic the teacher decides and a topic that I don't even talk about in my native language. Perhaps I just don't like writing but it just feels forced because I just don't write or speak in my target language unless absolutely needed. Is this normal? I improved in Korean considerably when I was in Korea because I had to talk in Korean on a regular basis and I don't remember being forced to talk about a random topic I don't even talk about in my native language. I can't seem to replicate the same effect in Japanese since it's not a language I need to use in my everyday life outside of class. 

I've seen tips like writing a diary in your target language or translating your thoughts into your target language but what if you just don't write a diary even in your native language? Can you really force output like this? I know you can't get better at writing or speaking without doing them but I'm having a hard time forcing myself to do those. I'm just at my breaking point now and this forced writing and speaking the teacher has us do every day is starting to kill my enjoyment in language learning.",1627999920,InsomniaEmperor,7
languagelearning,THE ONLY LANGUAGE WITH...,"I live in this region [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/EqHA5DYH9ssg3pTc6) in the Philippines which is called the Bicol Region were the Bicolano language is dominantly spoken among the 150+ languages of the Philippines. 

Bikol, is an Austronesian language spoken by the Bicolanos (~2 Million speakers), primarily in the Bicol Region of southern Luzon, Philippines. Bikol also has a rich set of discourse particles, which can be hard to translate in Filipino (Tagalog).

But let's get to the gist of it. The Bicolano language is the only language with ""angry registers."" Present in all the dialects of the Bicol language, the angry register stems from the strong positive or negative emotions of the interlocutors, and, hence, meaning is perceptual, specifically aural, rather than morphologic. The angry register is unique to Bicol languages as it cannot be found in other Austronesian Languages inside and outside the Philippines. It is generally used only among same-age speakers or by older speakers to younger listeners, as usage by younger speakers in addressing their elders would constitute great disrespect. On occasion, the angry register is used in sarcasm or humor, but the majority of its usage is in anger. Rinconada Bikol has contributed much to this unique feature.

To dumb it down, it means we have another existing words to certain words to constitute and express anger which certain nouns, adjectives, and verbs are replaced when the speaker is angry. 

Example of words and phrases:

Eyes
(Use your eyes)
Normal - Gamiton mo ang MATA mo!
Angry - Gamiton mo ang MALSOK mo!

Cat
(Whose cat is this?)
Normal - Kay sisay na IKOS ini?
Angry - Kay sisay na KURASMAG ini?

Woman
(Where is that woman?)
Normal - Hain/yain na daw an na BABAYI na an?
Angry - Hain/yain na daw an na BABAKNIT na an?

Mouth
(Watch your mouth!)
Normal - Iling-ilingon mo ang NGIMOT mo
Angry - Iling-ilingon mo ang NGISLO mo!

Dog
(Whose dog is this?)
Normal - Kay sisay na AYAM ini?
Angry - Kay sisay na GAMADYA ini?

Asleep
(Are you still asleep?)
Normal - TUROG ka pa nanggad?
Angry - KATIPLA ka pa nanggad?

Hand
(I'll break your hand!)
Normal - Lapuon ko an na KAMOT mo
Angry - Lapuon ko an na KAMULMOG mo

Feet
(Your feet are dirty)
Normal - Maation ang mga BITIS mo
Angry - Maation ang SAMINGKIL mo!

It's worth noting that other terms also exist in different places, but I mainly used above what is being utilized in our place.

As can be observed, the angry register forms are not generally predictable from the normal register forms, although there may at times be a slight resemblance between the two. Indeed, they would be incomprehensible to a non-native speaker who had only learned the normal register of the language. 

So yeah, I feel like I didn't explain it well to you all, but if you are interested and want to dive deep in the topic you can always search the angry register of the Bikol/Bicol language on Google. I'm happy that I've got to share what's unique about my native language and I've only appreciated it when I only dived into the world of language learning, and I'm proud I've got to share my first post here as a long-time lurker.

Goodluck to your language learning journey and remember that appreciate your language! 🤗",1627999531,RupertRobbed,16

languagelearning,Help with learning my native tongue,"
TL;WR I want to learn my native tongue so my family had the idea of only speaking to me in it but im wondering if it will work.

Hi,

I'm a 14 y/o student in the UK going into yr 10, and I'm from Botswana, in Africa.

For the entirety of my life so far i've been able to understand the language but never speak it back, although I've tried, and have been meaning to learn it for a while now.

The reason I didn't learn my  native language is because when I was entering pre-school at home in botswana my parents would speak to me in setswana but my school didn't, and so i lagged behind everyone else at school and wasnt able to speak, and so my school thought that being spoken to in 2 different languages confused me as to how to speak it (which is complete BS,  i think i was just really quiet.)

This isnt really an issue, as both of my parents are fluent in English, but I just want to be able to speak to them in their native tongue/ speak to my grandparents and extended family.

I raised these concerns with my mum, and she and I came to the conclusion that if I was completely immersed in Setswana at home, I'd be forced to recover my ability to speak it (I used to be able to speak more setswana than English) and so we've been trying that, although we keep forgetting about this agreement so i havent learnt much.
My father also thinks I should learn Setswana.

So, my question is, will this actually work out and make me learn Setswana, or will I be wasting my time?
I also have severe ADHD, which might explain why i was slow learning the language, and keep that in mind when writing any solutions. Thanks!",1627993310,moffrow-am,4

In a couple of months I'm going to have a brother who's planned to be brought up bilingual (Russian and Spanish) – we share a mother and his dad is Venezuelan. 
As we live in Russia, there aren't that many books available in foreign languages here, especially for kids. So I was thinking of ordering some books online as a present so that my brother feels an equal presence of both cultures in his early days. 

Unfortunately, I don't speak Spanish so I'd appreciate your advice, if you can recommend some authentic books for kids in Spanish that in your experience were interesting, meaningful and well-illustrated (especially if you know any Venezuelan ones).

languagelearning,HOW I ORGANIZE MY LANGUAGE LEARNING STUDIES!,"So I know that alot of people spends tons and tons of time making the perfect language learning schedule and tge perfect language learning notebook etc. 
so I decided I would show you how my setup looks like.
❌Spoiler Alert: it’s not perfect❌
So I started off with making a folder for language learning in my notes app
and just called it “📚language learning”. Then inside that folder I made another folder for the language I’m learning so it became 
“🇭🇷croatian”, now if you’re learning multiple languages you can add multiple folders, just make sure you have a folder for each language. Now inside that Croatian folder I make two folders, “📒learning” and “📚pre-planning” in my pre-planning folder I made another folder called “📒notebook setup” 
Now I will show you how I organized each folder:

PRE-PLANNING:
In my pre-planning folder I have another folder called Notebook setup(down below) I also just write things that I need to remember before I have actually started studying.

NOTEBOOK SETUP:
In this folder I made 1 note for each of my notebooks, right now I am using 4 notebooks, one for journaling, one for vocabulary, one for my goals and one for everything else.
The setups are pretty simple: I have 4 pages with table of contents then I just have everything else that I want to write.

Then in the goals notebook I don’t have a table of Contents I just write my 2021 goals on one page then my August goals on another and my weekly goals on the other etc.

LEARNING:
In the 📒learning folder I just put things like recordings for when I record myself talking or reading. I also put things like my Resources or my Monthly reviews in that folder. I think it’s good to ask yourself questions like:
What went good? 
What went bad?
Was there balance between the 5 skills?(reading, listening, writing, speaking and culture)
Is there something you need to change during next month?
So ask yourself all of these questions at the end of every month.

STUDY SCHEDULE:
For my study schedule I just use a whiteboard that I have on my door, I make the schedule based of my weekly and monthly goals. For example:
MONTHLY:
- I want to learn more food vocabulary
Then on my schedule I would write:
- learn some basic foods

I feel like using a whiteboard is easier then having it on paper since you can erase and change things.",1627982521,CowGirl080725,22

languagelearning,For improving listening skills: Audiobook or YouTube video,"Hello everyone, I am studying Spanish and now I am about A2 level in terms of vocabulary, but my listening skills are not going well because I mainly learned the new words through the news and article.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros: if along with the text version book - can know the actual sentences

Cons: paid; words and phrases are more literary; not sure if it is fit for A2 level learner

&amp;#x200B;

YouTube video:

Pros: free; phrases and words are more practical

Cons: most of the videos didn't provide the Spanish subtitles - hard to know the correct sentence

![video](wgotv33z83f71 ""Like anything in life, 
If we pretend we're something long enough, 
We may just become it. "")

&amp;#x200B;

I've genuinely impressed this scene. I could have a motivation to learn English from the British accent. As a Korean, our education system just stuck with together American accent. As you know, if something repeat enormously, I make someone sick. Additionally, the judgement about every pronunciation is horrible. I have no opportunity to speak the English language.

&amp;#x200B;

But my first trip to the UK changed all my perspectives. And now I'm released from the obsessions.

Now I think, I wish, and many people want to learn a language in a way of that we already had at the time we were learnt our mother tongue in our childhood. Just listening and mimicking the sounds.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm making an app for language learning alone. But only in a 'listen and speaking' way. I don't know all the alphabet and basic words in French, German, Russian. But I like all the way of making sounds in their languages. So, in a meantime, I'm practising several languages.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my application, I learnt iOS programming last year and published this on Apr. It's still progressing. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was a journey from far ago, and already took my several months without any income, and it's still free, and I have no plan to monetize this yet. But I'm wishing to make something to express my personal language learning experience.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I want to release as many people I can, from a bunch of books and an effort about grammar and vocabulary list.

Nearly 97% of Korean just stuck with book and I could see many foreign people who want to learn Korean but in the same way.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought, there is a specific problem. The actual speaking in face-to-face takes a lot of money.

I had tried 1:1 tutoring with a professional English teacher in my home country and joined a language school in London.

All the way takes so many times and money. I don't think the learning of languages requires to be a privilege or need many efforts for the preparations.

&amp;#x200B;

I also tried so many apps to get more opportunity.

But the best thing was watching a YouTube, the Korean English man and Jolly. And I do a repeating alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'm still fragile at all grammar and structuring a sentence. But I don't care, I'm not caring about a judgement which some Korean people or someone has less experience are usually enjoying.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently struggling with what language to learn. I hope that perhaps you could offer me some insights into what to learn. So a bit of backstory, I'm from the Netherlands, so my native language is Dutch. I am however studying to become an English teacher and I've achieved (almost formally) CPE. I however also adored Japan for years and recently also the Spanish-speaking world and more recently South Korea. I also enjoy a challenge and growth for me is important so if I can learn a language that changes the way that I perceive the world or life, then that would be really interesting too.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, what language do you recommend me to learn? I thought to help answer this question it would be useful if I included reasons why it interests me and what makes me less motivated.  


Japanese  
\+ I love the culture  
\+ Beautifucl language  
\+ Anime and I want to travel there in my life at least once. I have considered teaching there for a year though it is out of my comfort zone.  
\- I've heard it's really difficult. + It feels as if it would take at least 2 years to become even slightly okayish at the language.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             - Nearly no native speakers near me, no clue how to access native speakers.                               

&amp;#x200B;

Korean  
\+ I really enjoy the music, I enjoy the culture, the attitude,                                                                                                                                               + I watched a historical fiction series of Korea and its architecture, history genuinely interested me.                                                                       + Also a country I consider to teach for a year.                                                                                                                                                              + Beautiful language                                                                                                                                                  - Very difficult as well.

My level of English is upper-intermediate (B2/C1). 

I have noticed that I am able to read newspapers or books without any major issue. I understand the vast majority of the vocabulary.

My problem is that when I speak in English, I do not use all the words that I know, but I tend to use the usual basic words or circumlocutions instead of some adjectives. This is an issue that I don't have when I have to write, since I have more time to reflect on the right word to pick.

Do you have any recommendations for me?  How can I actually use in my daily use words that I have already learned in the past

So i really love the Russian language and I started learning intensively something like a week ago, I made good progress but I find no one to talk to in tandem because they either don't answer, dissapear suddenly or only want to talk in English or French and never actually help me with Russian so I barely practice, I tried watching youtube, reading, listenning to songs and some other ressources but even if I build a good vocabulary I just don't know where to begin and I'm completely lost with the particularities of Russian and the amount of ressources available (and because I speak French and English I have even more ressources available).

I should also mention that I never was a fan of grammar (I learned to speak English quite well and I don't even know the difference between the present simple and the present perfect) therefore even if I study grammar I don't remember it as well as if I was just talking to someone

My questions are simple

• What ressources to chose (free ones ehe)
• How to practice when nobody answers (or if you want PM me and let's ne friends !)

languagelearning,"Cantonese is linguistically a Language, but politically a Dialect.","Cantonese is linguistically a Language.

First, Cantonese is not mutually intelligible with Mandarin, native Chinese people cannot understand Cantonese (though Hong Kong people can understand Mandarin because there are Mandarin classes in Hong Kong's primary school), the mutual intelligibility between Cantonese and Mandarin is arguably less than the mutual intelligibility between Danish, Swedish and Norwegian.

Second , Cantonese and Mandarin have different grammar rules, for Cantonese, it is 我高過你(I higher than you), for Mandarin, it is 我比你高(I than you higher).

The Third one is less-known, Cantonese actually has its own written system that is different from the Mandarin one, Cantonese words such as 嘅、啲、喺、係、俾 are used very seldom in Mandarin, and some Cantonese phrases are used in Mandarin but have different meaning in Mandarin such as 犀利、得意、宜家、隔離, the most highlighted example recently is that quarantine in Chinese (隔離) has one meaning in Mandarin (Quarantine) but two meanings in Cantonese (Quarantine and Nearby), if a native Chinese go a walk on Hong Kong forums (like LIHKG or HK Discuss), they will not be able to read and understand the articles and comments because there are many Cantonese words and slangs that are not used or different in Mandarin.

Forth, the most obvious one, Cantonese and Mandarin have different pronunciation, Cantonese has 6 tones with 3 ending tones (k,t,p) while Mandarin has 4 tones with 1 soft tone, some Chinese words have the same pronunciations in both Cantonese and Mandarin (such as 馬 maa/ma) but some other Chinese words have totally different pronunciations in both Cantonese and Mandarin (such as 香 hoeng/xiang).

However, due to Hong Kong's political situation (being a Special Administrative Region under the People's Republic of China), Hong Kong is not a country but a part of the Greater China Region, under the nationalism of the Chinese Communist Party, Cantonese is considered a dialect of Chinese despite being very different with Mandarin, maybe one day Cantonese will be widely recognized as a language instead of a dialect, who knows?",1627887099,LoveEverywhere_hk,21

Watch streamers in your target language, this has been by far the most beneficial thing I have ever done for my German. I've actually started noticing the effects as well, i've started to have thoughts in German, I feel I can naturally kind of speak (based on me now having thoughts in German) despite doing 0 speaking practice.

Watching streamers is basically full immersion and I know everyone hates the pseudo-relationship people form with streamers but actually do it for the sake of your language, type in chat to respond to whatever they're doing etc. 

A few tips, actively listen; watch what they're doing so you can associate the audio with the image - just like how a child learns via Dora the explorer etc. Make flash cards; I take sentences people write in chat and I copy them into anki to learn and experiment with E.g one that might be helpful once I move to Germany is ""Du hast meinen Namen sogar richtig ausgesprochen"". People type helpful sentences in chat all the time, so copy them!

languagelearning,Spanish or French first?,"Hi, I am currently struggling with whether I should pursue learning Spanish or French first. I am in the USA. I am taking community college classes and plan on transferring elsewhere in a year or so, which require language courses from my current school. Whatever I choose will be my first formal foray into learning a language, besides the bits of Swedish I have picked up through the years as my mom and sister are both fluent, active speakers. 

I feel more excited about the possibility of learning French, as I have always been drawn to France and its culture, history, and music. I also have family and family friends in France and Switzerland who I would love to visit, and it would be wonderful to be able to speak in French with them and their children. My sister also speaks French, so I could possibly practice with her.

On the other hand, I think Spanish would be more useful for me. There are more and more Spanish speakers in the US, and in my community there are a lot of farmhands and domestic workers that speak Spanish exclusively. I am studying sociology at the moment, but I hope to eventually have a career that enables me to help communities such as the incarcerated, homeless, and disabled. Possibly law or some kind of social work? My parents greatly want me to be a lawyer, and they are encouraging me to do Spanish as they believe it would be more helpful in that field. 

For my situation, which do you think I should learn first? I feel more drawn to choosing French, but my parents are probably correct that Spanish would be more useful for both my location (USA) and my career hopes. I would appreciate any thoughts ❤️",1627843882,cloudyside,6

languagelearning,Has anyone had luck finding language partners in person?,"I have spoken one foreign language (Spanish) at a reasonably high level for a long time, since high school. I learned it without really having a reason to. I just thought it would be cool to speak another language, and the culture, history, and art of Latin America were interesting to me. It wound up being one of the most enriching experiences of my life -- I discovered tons of literature and music that would become some of my favorite things, made great friends I otherwise would not have, gained a new perspective on the world, etc. I'm sure the members of this sub know what I'm talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a vague desire to learn a third language for a while now, but my life and motivations are a lot different. I have a full time job and can't study for hours at a time like I did as a teenager. I also can't force myself to go through mountains of dry reading material or watch movies and shows I'm only half-interested in solely because *they're in my target language*. I know how much effort it takes just to maintain my Spanish, find interesting content and reading to improve my vocabulary, and so on, and don't really have the time or the motivation to do that with another language.

&amp;#x200B;

What really motivates me is people. When I started Spanish I was primarily focused on being able to read/understand, but later found that having real-life conversations with people was far and away the most rewarding part of it.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, it seems like all language interchanges these days are online. Nothing wrong with that, and understandably it's a lot easier to find people to speak with when *the entire world* is your pool, but I really just have no desire to talk over video chat. I do enough of that working from home, and for that matter I spend enough of my time staring at a screen. But I would love to find someone local I could get together with every week or so and have a face-to-face conversation with. I live in a pretty diverse, decent sized city (1-2 million people counting metro area), but I wonder how practical this would be.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have experience doing this? Tips, tricks on finding someone local to practice with?

We’re both native English so he’ll obviously pick that up, but we have a lot of other languages that we can start using around the house. What I’m more concerned about is if we will just confuse the hell out of him if we keep flipping between too many. 

Here’s what we have: mandarin (myself basic conversational, grandmother native, close friend fluent), Spanish (wife, grandmother, future nanny all fluent), French (myself conversational, close friend fluent). 

My question is if we should try to limit our household to just Spanish (which I can try to learn), just what we’re fluent/conversational in, or just try to expose him to everything. We can generally have one non-English language going at all times based on who’s in the house, but it can’t always be the same language.

###What I did
Watched children's shows from my childhood and their continuations and spin-offs, and read simple manga.

###Journal entries

**Tuesday**
It's no wonder English speakers can learn Spanish so fast, beyond the obvious cognates there are a lot of expressions that translate word for word like 
'... rests on your shoulders'


**Wednesday**
I wonder if there exists a natural order for vocabulary similar to the natural order for certain grammatical features. It would not be as strict, because
I think you can acquire almost any word if it's presented to you frequently enough in comprehensible contexts, even if the word is very rare on the average. However,
I think that the ability to retain them for an extended period of time may be limited by such an ordering principle that is more complicated than simple frequency.
For example, I just learned the word 'manga' which I believe means 'sleeve', but this word is probably not as frequent as most of the others I know, and I'm pretty sure
that I will forget it soon. But if frequency was all that there is to it, then I think that a lot more infrequent words should be present in beginners vocabularies, because,
while they are much less likely to be acquired, there is also a lot more of them.

**Sunday**
I just ordered the Harry Potter series from Amazon Spain and I learnt the word for Hungary in the process, about which I had doubts if it'd ever appear in my immersion but
I saw it when making my order so it's fine.

###Misc. comments

As a teen, I learned some Spanish via watching tv shows, and when I say learned, I mean I understood most of the tv shows without too many problems. Now I forgot a bit but I listen to songs all the time and after doing some Duolingo, I'd rate my knowledge at an A2/ low B1 level.

I also learned some Slovenian and I'd say I have the same level as Spanish, but if I want to say a sentence I struggle with both of them. I have to wait for the words to come into my mind but typically can say something decent without many grammar mistakes.

I know a lot of people, typically the children of migrants, who can understand their mother tongue 100% but who cannot speak it competently at all. (In some cases they can't even formulate a grammatical sentence despite having more or less perfect oral comprehension.)

How do you reconcile this common phenomenon with the ideas behind comprehensible input?

Besides intellectual and cultural edification, my main goal is to *understand the mechanisms of grammar at a deeper level*. My incredible writing teacher is inspiring me to write well.  I think a second language would help.

Which language do you think will help me *best understand the logic of grammar*?  Yes, I know, Latin and Greek. But I will only consider modern and frequently used European languages: French, German, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Russian, Portuguese. Maybe I can stretch to Arabic.

languagelearning,An app to learn Arabic reading and writing,"Why do I feel that learning how to read the script of a language is so underrated? Most popular apps focus of different aspects of ""fluency"", grammar, and vocabulary, but not specifically how to read and write languages written in foreign script (e.g. Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew ... etc). In Arabic in particular, I see many approaches try to teach Arabic with romanization into Latin characters, which is pretty inconsistent to say the least. Otherwise, teaching the alphabet and the script is either too implicit in the learning approaches and is assumed to be learned while learning other things, or too explicit, dedicating whole sections or learning modules just to learn a single letter. 

In my case I am a native speaker of Arabic but I live in the US. I have been trying for many years to get my kids (14 and 11) to read and to write in Arabic (they already understand and speak reasonably), but it hasn’t been working. I tried many things: in-person programs, courses, apps, books, flash cards, and many other things, and it either didn’t work, or worked very marginally. 

So, this summer, I have worked specifically to address this: just to make something to get the kids to identify the letters of any given Arabic word and sound it out. I built a small app/web page in a quiz-style, so that they can practice on it for 10 minutes a day. Interestingly, in less than a week, and without any other resources, they were able to reach very high accuracy at the app and to actually start to read many things in Arabic; e.g. the menu items in Arab restaurants, Facebook posts and memes, and WhatsApp messages ,etc. I think this is encouraging, and I’m happy that they can finally start to read in Arabic. Of course there are many things still to learn, but I think this is a good start. 

I'd like to share this app with you, I suppose it can work well for both kids and adults wishing to learn how to read the Arabic script. It is still in an early version so I really appreciate any feedback!

Here is the link to the app (it is free):

I have recently had a discussion with my mom, who knows about my passion for language learning, about my wish to learn Korean and Japanese and acquire a bit of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and French knowledge. thing is, I speak two languages fluently, Romanian and English, but I’m also learning German at school. when I go to college, I want to study in English, as the main language, meaning that I’ll have to choose a second one, and since many universities lack diversity regarding second language options, I most likely will have to go with German, where I have an A2, close to B1 level, and I’m highly aware that I still have a long way to go until I can reach “fluency”. my main concern is, though, that I really want to improve my Korean, since it’s the language, as of now, that I have most knowledge in, other than German, among the ones that I mentioned above and I really don’t want to give up on it, or stop my continuous improvement, since I’m currently studying a lot, because I know that language learning is one of my biggest passions and I would waste it all away if I didn’t put varied effort in, now that I have proven myself that I can do it. I really don’t know what to do, because my mom told me to focus more on German so that I’ll have a clear path in college. she didn’t directly tell me to give up on Korean or Japanese (I haven’t started seriously paying close attention to the Romance languages yet, so I’m a beginner), but although I like studying German, I don’t want to focus on it only. maybe I should prioritise it for now, until I progress, while still learning Korean and Japanese, just not as much, and once I feel I’m better, I can interchange the plans

languagelearning,I feel awful when taking a day off from studying my target language,"Hi everyone, so, I've been studying Japanese by myself pretty intensely for 3.5 months now, at first I studied 2-3 hours a day bursting through the first two textbooks, Genki I and II, in 2 months, that got me to around N4 (more less equivalent to A2 as far as I know). I could get through them that way because even though I never noticed it anime had actually taught me some things, so it was all already seen. After that I studied kanji pretty intensely for 10 days or so (18-20 a day, which is a lot for me) and did lots of listening practice with transcripts. At that point I was studying 4 hours a day.

Right now I'm using a book that will get me to an intermediate level (Tobira), studying 4 hours a day plus 1.5-2 hours of other immersion. Now thing is, I did take into account taking a day off every 8-10 days, but whenever I try to *think* about actually using it I feel awful. Even though I know there would be the benefit of letting the things I just learned sit, and also I think it's fair to take a break after studying this much. 

Even knowing that I can't bring myself to just take a day off with no ""formal"" studying (I still listen to some stuff in japanese for enjoyment). Do y'all struggle with this kind of thing? If so how do you get through it? I have moments in the more intense days where would *really* love a break, but when the day comes I just can't.

The vibrant indigo flowers of the Clitoria ternatea plant (or Sungupoo in Tamil) is a vividly deep blue flower with a light-yellow color in its center. The flower is native to equatorial Asia and is often grown as an ornamental plant. Butterfly pea flower tea, also known as blue tea , owed to its brilliant shade of sapphire, confers amazing health benefits like promoting weight loss and uplifting moods. An uplifted mood could also be due to the improvement of memory and cognitive function. This display of tremendous memory boosting can surely help you find your lost keys or slippers, right? Enjoy our recipe below [and video](https://youtu.be/cREF1acyd5w) which is in Tamil and subtitled into English as well as 9 other languages.

INGREDIENTS 1 cup fresh or dried butterfly pea flowers 1 litre water Lemon juice, to taste Honey or sugar, to taste

INSTRUCTIONS If using fresh flowers, remove and discard the green stalks and stems by pinching them away with your fingers. (note: this process dyes your fingertips slightly. It goes away with a few washes, but wear gloves if you’d prefer.) Dried flowers can be used as is. Rinse the fresh flowers thoroughly a few times to remove any dirt from them. Heat water in a pot and turn it off just before it starts to boil. Add the flowers to the water, clamp on a lid and wait for it to steep for 3-5 minutes. The water will be a deep blue by this time. Strain, decant into a glass jar, and refrigerate. To serve, add 1 part concentrate to 5 parts cold water. Sweeten with honey if using and squeeze over enough lime to taste. Stir and serve over ice for an iced tea . This tea can be served hot too, with the same ratio of concentrate to water.",1627704132,TUBETHAMBI,2

languagelearning,Why do people ask if you speak a language you're already conversing with them in?,"Upper B2 moving into C1 in Spanish.

Why do people ask this question when you're already conversing in the language? I run into this fairly often, where someone will ask me if I speak Spanish when we are already in a Spanish-speaking context. Everytime it happens it throws me off a bit - I'll answer very briefly and the person usually ends up thinking I don't speak the language. If we're able to move on to different topics, they probably get the idea of my level, but after an awkward introduction and a bad first impression. 

After each time it comes up I'll think about how I should respond the next time, but it always catches me off guard and the same thing happens. It seems like a strange question to me when we're already in a context in which it would make sense for the person to just speak to me in Spanish and gauge my level (like, ask me literally any other question about myself ((in Spanish)) and kill two birds with one stone!). Do others have this happen, and find it odd or off-putting? Again, it's always when I'm already in a Spanish-speaking context, it's not like I'm in a Wal-Mart in Texas and someone is trying to find out if I speak Greek or something.

My language skill is definitely a sore spot for me because of the way that I was thrown into learning Spanish (where anything less than complete fluency has never felt good enough) and my own perfectionism, so I don't know if I'm being a bit too touchy about this question. However, it sometimes feels like a weird power move. 

Most recently example: I was casually dating someone in a Spanish-speaking country. We went to meet up briefly with three of his friends whom I'd never met before. Everyone except for me is a native Spanish speaker and the entire interaction is in Spanish. We do greetings, sit down and they all start chatting a bit. One of them asks me where I'm from, I answer, and then he asks me ""do you speak Spanish?"" ""Ehmm..yeah."" ""How good is your Spanish?"" I fluster a bit because the question strikes me as an odd, and so I turn to my date, ""well, I don't know, what do you think?"" Date: ""I've heard worse."" \[Yeah, fuck him.\] Then that's that with the conversation, until a bit later the same person asks me how I learned Spanish. Another tricky question - as if there is one route to learning a language. ""Uh.. it's a long road,"" I say. ""It just takes practice,"" says guy. Finally when we get on to other topics I begin to be able to speak more freely and, really, everyone finally got their answer on whatever my level of Spanish is, way better than asking explicitly got them.

tl;dr : why do people ask if you speak a language you're already conversing with them in? Do you find it an attempt to be polite or a subtle attempt at throwing shade? Does this bother anybody else?",1627663668,calypsoorchid,43

languagelearning,FREE English Conversation Class?,"Hey Language Lovers

TL;DL - Would you be interesting in attending a free (or donation based) English Conversation Class, and hour and a half Saturday morning 11am GMT+1? 

For the past few years I have been running a volunteer English class here in Paris. I've done beginner and more advanced classes. This past year it has mainly been conversation classes via Zoom.

I'm not a trained English teacher but I am a native speaker who is studying at university level who is also interested in learning languages (French, Swedish, Esperanto, Mandarin), so I think i've got a few bits of knowledge to pass on. 

I give the classes through a small association that mainly teaches French to new arrivals in France, I started learning French with them and wanted to give something back. 

Anyway, I'm rambling now, i'll get to the point.

I've loved giving these classes over Zoom for the past few months, an hour and a half on Saturday morning, I would pick a topic or grammar point and we would just discuss it. Like I said, I'm not trained so I would usually just go with the flow, it's all free for the students so I was always thinking that as long as I can get them using and listening to English then it's good. 

What I want to know is that if I were to open up the classes, to like everyone, would there be some people here interesting in taking part?

It would be somewhat informal in terms of me not chasing you up for homework blah blah blah but I could give you resources and maybe set up a duolingo class and whatsapp group. It would be a place where you could just come and use the English you already know and get confident in using it but also pick up some new stuff too.",1627652752,Psychological-Ad6814,0

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I don't have any job and I have much time so today I decided to put in 12 hours each day for 6 months with some strategies:

&amp;#x200B;

**2 hours of listening and reading, How?**

I'll choose one video every day from My Story Animated or That's My Story channel, I'll enable English subtitles and keep listening. About reading I'll use my eyes only to see English subtitles during listening to the video ( kill two birds with one stone ).

Every video must have 10 minutes approximately and I'll repeat the video 12 times equal 2 hours.

I tested this strategy 9 months ago and I noticed when I repeat the video the level of understanding is increasing even if I don't know the vocabulary. Unfortunately, I did not continue like this because I was busy.

If you have any suggestions for other channels I'll be glad.

&amp;#x200B;

**2 hours of reading, How?**

In the previous way, I was practicing listening and reading together but now I'll practice reading only by reading a book named 4000 essential English words. This book is helpful because it contains short stories and questions to test you. This is a good way to learn new vocabulary.

If you have any suggestions for another book I'll be glad.

&amp;#x200B;

**3 hours of listening, How?**

In this way I'll be cooking, exercise and take shower, etc.. during listening but I think sometimes I'll become absent-minded. Is that will be okay or I must be a focus on the speech of the speaker?

&amp;#x200B;

**2 hours of imitation, How?**

I'll open any movie and choose 1 scene and I'll imitation a specific actor like pronounciation and way of speaking and I'll repeat the scene for 2 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

**3 hours of speaking, How?**

I'll find an academy that provides speaking practice between students, But to be honest, not sure yet, So I need your advice.

&amp;#x200B;

If I applied these strategies every day for 6 months, Where my level will be in English?

&amp;#x200B;

I wrote this topic with myself with a little bit of correction using the Grammarly website so maybe there will be mistakes. I hope the supervisor did not delete my topic.

languagelearning,A small guide to increasing vocabulary,"Whether you are a language learner or a native speaker, having a large vocabulary is always valuable. It's not fun to constantly consult a dictionary when you are watching a video or reading a book. It's spirit-taking to be at loss for words because your vocabulary is too small. Your brain is full of ideas and topics to discuss, yet you are limited by your vocabulary.

In language learning, it is near impossible to begin practising grammar if your vocabulary is smaller than 500-700 words. You will be forced to rely on the sources that your native language provides.

You can know the grammar rules perfectly, but if your vocabulary is small, it will be really challenging for foreigners to understand you. Nevertheless, someone who knows around 2000 words will be understood easily, despite his/her grammar flaws.

# Passive and active vocabulary

You should be concrete about what you are trying to improve. You will not experience great growth by setting yourself a broad goal of increasing your vocabulary. Furthermore, there are two types of vocabulary.

Passive and active.

**Passive vocabulary** is the vocabulary that hides in the back of your skull. It consists of words you understand, but are not capable of using.

**Active vocabulary** is the vocabulary that hides in the front of your mind. It consists of words you understand and are capable of using (in the form of speaking or writing).

You can evaluate your active vocabulary by observing the most used words by you during a conversation or a writing session (you can't keep many words there).

Nonetheless, evaluating your passive vocabulary is a lot more difficult. It's much bigger than the active one. You don't use every word you read in the book or listen to in a lecture. There's an abundance of words that you know, yet don't use. This is what's called passive vocabulary.

# Ways for increasing passive vocabulary

In my experience, the process of enhancing your passive vocabulary is not hard (compared to the process of active vocabulary). Two things have worked wonders for me. They are Anki and consumption of content.

Anki is a free flashcard program that uses spaced repetition for long-term memorization.

**Spaced-repetition** is a learning technique that is usually performed with flashcards. The new and strenuous flashcards are introduced more often, while the older and easier flashcards are shown less often.

If I desire to learn 20 particular words, I put them into Anki, add their definition, pictures, examples, and audio. I try to use as many senses as possible because it was proven to help memorization.

When it's time to repeat the words, I open the Notes app on my phone and type their definitions. Then, I come up with my own example (or two) for every word. Sometimes, instead of making an example, I write out an interesting fact about that word (its origin, for instance).

Every time you repeat the word, you must come up with a new example. It can be tiresome sometimes, but it's worth it.

&gt;A tiny hack: if a word has two meanings or more, add separate flashcards. It will save you some pain in the ass when you know the first meaning, yet forgot the second one.

And the best method for acquiring a large passive vocabulary (in my opinion) is **consumption of content**. It does magic for everyone.

All you have to do is to search for challenging content that will throw unknown words at you periodically. Advanced learners may face some difficulties here. Their level is so high that YouTube videos and TV shows rarely surprise them. I advise reading, in that case.

Beginners and especially intermediate learners are lucky. Their knowledge is not so giant and therefore YouTube and movies are perfect for them.

You don't have to look up every word you hear. Try to guess its meaning from its context. If you can't, you can continue watching the episode without guilt. If you hear it more than 3 times, then you have to google its meaning (this is the method I used).

However, if you are reading a book, then I would counsel you to look up every word.

# Ways for increasing active vocabulary

If you have a desire to enrich your speech and become more fluent with the language, then you have to work on your active vocabulary. It's not easy. It will put you out of your comfort zone, but the results will warm your heart, I promise you.

Pick 10 words you wish to have in your daily speech and writing practice. And give yourself a week to practice them as much as you can. Write them out on a piece of paper and carry them everywhere. When you write, use that piece of paper as your guide. When you talk, make it your goal to use at least one of them in your conversation.

Every word must be used **at least 5 times** in the course of that week.

After 7 days, pick another 10 words and repeat the process. The more frequently you use the words, the better your speech active vocabulary will become.

It's OK if you forget some of them. Your goal is to retain at least 1.

# Conclusion

This what has always worked for me. It doesn't mean that it will work for you. 

I hope I could be of help.

languagelearning,I was wrong. TPRS is fascinating.,"A couple of years ago I saw [an hour-long YouTube documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=illApgaLgGA) made by a Spanish teacher in the US about his one-year quest to get to conversational fluency in Arabic without direct study.

I thoroughly enjoyed it, and used some of the ideas in it to help get my start learning Korean.

But one thing from that video that I was extremely skeptical of was TPRS (Teaching Proficiency Through Reading and Storytelling). I watched some demos online and it just seemed... incredibly boring. I couldn't wrap my head around it.

Then I had an opportunity to try a TRPS lesson in a language I have never studied (and don't have any immediate plans to study). My mind was blown. I was 100% engaged the whole time. My brain felt like it was in some sort of hyper-focused overdrive. I woke up the next morning with phrases from the lesson rattling around in my head. It usually takes _a lot_ of exposure before I start hearing that din in the head. This was less than an hour.

When I see people write in my native language, their problem is almost never vocabulary. It's things like prepositions. Word order. Getting the nouns and verbs to agree in terms of tense, gender, and number. More word order. More gender.

Don't get me wrong, vocabulary is crucial. It's hard to read an interesting book without vocabulary. But vocabulary doesn't seem to trip language learners up the way grammar does.

What I think TPRS gets right is the concept of _micro-fluency_ with a sheltered vocabulary for the very first stage of learning a new language. It seems like it almost doesn't matter at first what the early vocabulary is, if you're getting an intuitive sense of all the basic bits and pieces of grammar.

This in turn means that early lessons or content can use whatever vocabulary is going to be easiest to make comprehensible, even if those things aren't necessarily things you'd generally encounter in day-to-day life.

So, yeah. I was wrong :) TPRS is pretty cool, and if you have the chance, you should totally try a lesson in a language you know nothing about, just for the sake of experience.",1627597492,bildeglimt,82

languagelearning,Non-heritage speakers passing down new languages to their children.,"Hi everyone - I'd like to get some thoughts and opinions on something that I've been thinking about a lot lately. 

For context, I am from the U.S. originally (Black American), but I did not grow up in the U.S. or really live here until my late 20s. I speak 3 languages (I'd say the 3rd I'm at a C1 so not perfect, 2 of them I learned in my teens/early 20s due to living in the Middle East as a child and also 2 Latin American countries. I use all 3 in my daily life due to my family make up and my work and general interests. 

I am now thinking about my future with my partner and having children. He is not from the U.S. and also speaks another language as a heritage speaker (not really fluent tbh, but it is something that would be passed on to our children just by exposure to his family). 

It is of utmost importance to me that my children are multilingual - it's just not up for negotiation because the benefits and opportunities that it has given me are immeasurable. I want to teach my children, and keep them exposed to both Arabic and Spanish and I am already speaking spanish 50% of the time anyway because I am teaching my partner, I have many only-spanish speaking friends, and I work as a translator. 

Passing down languages as a heritage speaker is something that feels like a no-brainer to me, and also an extension of culture, but how are people navigating passing down languages that they've learned/taught themselves later in life? A part of me wonders...do I have the ""right"" to pass down something that is not a part of my own actual heritage? Is it weird that my family speak languages that technically do not ""belong"" to us, even if we are fluent? Can it become generational? 

I guess I'm thinking a lot about how new generations and linguistic bloodlines are being created, as we become and remain more global and inclined to learn new languages together. I don't want it to stop with just my parents and me, so what does this look like and mean for cultural and linguistic ownership? Do these languages belong to people and communities? Are they now mine too?

My problem is that I feel like I'm just below fluent, and I'm not sure how to address that. Like, I tested out of Duolingo and 9/10 times I can get my point across in Spanish, but it doesn't feel natural. Like, I sound clunky if I'm not prepared for the topic. I feel like my written and speaking comprehension are great, but I have trouble understanding spoken Spanish sometimes (except Mexican Spanish lol, my host family joked that I spoke Mexican because when I met a Chilean guy, I was totally lost and kept asking him to repeat stuff).

languagelearning,Chinese or German? :(,"I've never posted on this subreddit but I need some help.

So I go to a high school that teaches both Chinese and German, and I decided to take both of them because my schedule was able to fit it in. I am currently a senior and going into my 4th year of Chinese and 5th of German, but today I learned that I am no longer able to fit both into my schedule since both are during the same class period. I love both of these languages equally and genuinely can't make a decision or just ""replace"" one like my school counselor says I can easily do. I contacted all of my language teachers and they can't help me either. So I've come to reddit to help me list the pros and cons since I can't rationalize this on my own as of right now. 

In college I'm planning on majoring in German with a minor in Chinese and Korean. I'm way more advanced in German than I am Chinese, so if I take German I can stay at that level, but I probably won't be able to keep my progress in Chinese as I don't have anyone to speak at home with. If you're from the US, these are also AP classes, so I can take the final exams in the classes for college credit. If I take Chinese, I may still have the opportunity to do the German AP exam along with the Chinese AP exam, even if I'm not in the class. I would also probably lose some friends as they would think I just quit German out of nowhere, even though this isn't the case. I'm in both National German and Chinese Honor's Societies and again I love these languages equally with a burning passion. I'm not sure if I can use one of my free periods as an independent study. It also sucks because I'm a peer tutor for German and I'm not sure if I would be able to keep my spot as that and in NGHS if I choose Chinese, or if I can keep my spot in NCHS if I choose German. Thank you for listening to my rant.

languagelearning,Playlist Sharing,"**TLDR:** Sharing a couple of Tidal playlists of songs in specific languages for comprehensive input. Will make versions on YouTube Music and Spotify.

&amp;#x200B;

Whilst I'm coming to the end of my nursing degree and therefore have put a hold on any language learning progress (other than reviewing the odd Anki flashcard when they come up), I have never not been interested in music. In fact, it's been a necessity with me working on my dissertation. I also really value input when it comes to language learning, so I've been attempting to build playlists of songs that I enjoy divided up by their languages.

Please keep in mind that there will of course be a lot of bias in these playlists. There are most of my favourite songs in here somewhere. That being said, I do try and add a wide range of different genres and sound signatures to my playlists and will be updating these regularly.

Here are the playlists I have at the moment (as mentioned, these will be updated so long as there is interest from folks);

\- [Korean](https://tidal.com/browse/playlist/79fc9e10-ee46-4dd1-86cd-fe68701a7fd1)

\- [Japanese](https://tidal.com/browse/playlist/b27e36df-10d0-4114-b1d5-d9a2c5248afb)

\- [Welsh](https://tidal.com/browse/playlist/b5439927-9c4c-4d9e-b311-f7861184417d) (unfortunately so far no luck on finding Welsh songs but I'm definitely going to be working on that)!

These are on Tidal, but I am going to work on making identical playlists on YouTube Music and Spotify (over time, please remember that I do have to prioritize my last few months of university).

Hope this will help some of you! Please do feel free to hijack this post to add any of your own playlists. I always love having new music recommendations so you'll have one guaranteed listener.",1627579479,RevolutionaryDance51,1
languagelearning,Strategies for Improving Reading Skills (Intermediate-ish?),"So, I've been using LingQ to read in Spanish for about 5 months consistently now. I'm at the point where I can basically get the gist of everything I read in Spanish (articles to adult novels), though I know my accuracy isn't 100%. I only feel fairly confident with native language books aimed at grade schoolers (7-12 years old). The conventional wisdom on improving my reading ability is to just keep reading and don't worry so much about looking up the definition of words or studying grammar, but I'm finding it hard to believe that my reading accuracy and fluency wouldn't improve more quickly if I did some additional studying. Like...my 12 years of English classes weren't completely useless.

I noticed that for some reason they keep the same methods for learning between levels and its honestly annoying.

Which one do you think is the answer? True, False, or Not Given?

I answered that the information of the statement is not given but the correct answer is true because best reputation is similar to highliy regarded. Little confused because the passage’s sentence refers to the system of the uni, not the degree itself, but maybe I look at it wrong.

languagelearning,Should I take German or Spanish in college?," I start college this fall as an International Affairs major and I’m in the process of selecting my courses. I’ve been taking Spanish for all 4 years of high school, however, German has a really special place in my heart because my grandmother grew up there and would occasionally speak it when she was still with us. 

  I’ve never been a strong Spanish speaker (I’m kind of trash because I was placed in Spanish III as a high school freshman for some reason), and my skills in German are very basic beginner-skills. Even so, my brain can process German better when I hear it and I resonate with the culture so much more. 

  I’m going to be honest, the only reason that I’m being indecisive about this is because Spanish is such a useful language. Would I be making a big mistake if I decide to do German? What ways can German be beneficial and what advantages would it have over Spanish?",1627525529,emeraldgumdrop,46

I've studied all three at some point in the past and I've got my language learning system down so I feel like I could learn any of them without too much effort but I really would just want to stick to one for now.  Here are my personal pros and cons but give me your opinions!  

French: Plus is I'm over the hump on this language.  Studied it the longest, had personal tutors when I was in high school for a few years, got to a very decent conversional level and felt fluent in what I knew, but it's all gone now.  I'm over the issues that I think most people have with the language like knowing how words sounds based on spelling, etc.   Minus is that it's practically useless in my day to day, only French cultural stuff I'm interested in is some French music.

&amp;#x200B;

Italian: Plus is it's the language of my ancestors who stopped speaking it when they came to the US, which is such a shame.  I think I would feel closer to my past and I would really like to travel to Italy again sometime soon.  To my ears personally it's sounds the best of the three.  Cons are same as French except I really can't think of anything I currently do that would benefit from knowing Italian.  Maybe I would watch more Italian movies but probably only apart of the language learning process.

&amp;#x200B;

Spanish:  Plus is that it's obviously the most useful.  I live in the southern US so there are Mexicans/people of Mexican descent everywhere.  I've never been in a situation where just a little Spanish was beneficial, it's usually either you need a high level to get done what you need to get done (thinking professional applications) or the person speaks enough English to get it done so I can't really say that the little Spanish I do know has been that useful, but maybe if I got to a high level.  Cons are it sounds the worse to me, and I've just never been attracted to the Spanish diaspora culture at all.   I feel like I would be choosing utility over aesthetics which bothers me, but might not be a bad choice to make.

languagelearning,Best way to improve your listening skills.,"Its so easy you might not believe it or feel silly for not doing it from the beginning.  If you don't have a way to be in contact with native speakers you can always learn for your own voice. Reading articles and books out loud practicing phrases in your car or in the shower until they almost sound perfect to you. Just reading in your mind is such a precious waste of time (Read out loud!!!) It also means looking silly in the market when your practicing words and not caring. You will need to improve your accent so it can work. That means daily practicing words and phrases and being really critical of yourself. This is very vital. If your gonna learn form your voice your pronunciation needs to be really good, If it don't sound good don't accept it say that fucking sucks and keep imitating it like a monkey reading advice on forums and watching YouTube videos. I know the frustration of not being able to understand. Now I can talk to native speakers and learn because I understand 95 percent of words they are speaking, which seemed impossible at first. You'll eventually get so good you will notice subtle nuances about the pronunciation of the language and be really surprised. My German friend says I sound native on my umlauts an r pronunciation. End the frustration now and learn by hearing your own voice. This is one of the best piece of advices I can give after a lot of trial and error.",1627477808,Hund9618,30

languagelearning,Choosing between improving Spanish vs. German?,"**Why German?**

- I've lived in Germany and have had plenty of exposure to German language and Germany. I could *potentially* be moving to Germany again for 2-3 years. 

- I've a higher proficiency level in German. It used to be B1, now it's become much rustier and is around A2 level. Ideally, I'd like to be at least C1 level proficient.

- You *can* live in Germany without being very proficient in German, especially in Berlin. Most Germans speak English anyway, and disappointingly, I found Germans to be less communicative and supportive whenever I wanted to switch to German. Topmost reason for learning German is for professional reasons as being proficient in German could be very helpful. However, note that by the time I'll be proficient, the Return-on-Investment could be much smaller. 


**Why Spanish?**

- I absolutely hate the articles in German and have difficulty remembering them.

- Most importantly, German does not interest/appeal to me that much due to
 - a) lack of interesting (for me) media - movies/music/etc. and, 
 -  b) Spanish is far, far more useful as a language for traveling. Fewer Spanish-speakers are proficient in English than German speakers. 

- I find Spanish easier and more exciting to learn. Technically there's nothing stopping me from learning Spanish after German but I am doubtful if I'd have the necessary appetite for that by then. 

- My Spanish used to be A2. Currently its around A1.

- Spanish opens the door to other Romance languages, especially Italian and Portuguese, which could come in very handy later on for travel.",1627458691,Vibgyor_5,13

languagelearning,It's driving me crazy. I really need help--please,"I've been learning English for 10 years now. and I made two mistakes, and now they're driving me nuts. So I'd love it if you guys could help me sort this out.

I can understand everyone and I really mean it. Music, movies, tv shows, youtube videos, you name it. I understand everything without subtitles or lyrics.

The first mistake was I didn't practice speaking. I was born in a place where speaking a foreign language especially English is considered fancy.

And people used to relentlessly critique me for it. So I skipped the speaking part. and I'd always watch movies and listen to music on headphones so nobody could hear what I was listening to and whatnot.

My second mistake was I got too technical with English. I studied grammar, the phonetic alphabet, elision, assimilation of manner and place...mouth position, pitch, rhythms, and whatnot. In other words, I can break down the English language into pieces and write a book on it, but I can't use it 

My problem is:

I'm a native Portuguese speaker, but I was born in a region of Brazil where the language is more stress-timed. I theoretically know how syllable stress works; you gotta linger on it, change the pitch and say it louder. but in practice, I just can't do that. When I'm not aware of what my mouth is doing nor am I not thinking about it, I can get the rhythm right off the bat, but then I always mess up when I repeat it. I've seen many videos on youtube where they're like: pay attention to how these functional words sound swallowed and unclear compared to the stressed syllables. and that's the problem. I've been listening to English for so long that even the functional words sound clear to my ears. I swear I can freaking understand and hear every single function word or maybe my brain just fills the blanks up automatically--IDK. I'm a musician and also a big fan of music especially rap and I've been listening to Eminem since I was 13 when I started learning English. I could understand his new songs and I didn't google the lyrics. But I can't consciously replicate the rhythm of English. I know the rhythm is embedded in my ears and brain but I don't know how to pull it off--- because it always throws me off when I listen to non native English speakers and they don't have the right rhythm, you know. it's hard to explain my problem because it doesn't make that much sense. But I can recognize when my rhythm is off because I have a hard time understanding myself when my rhythm is off. In other words, I have the listening of a native-like speaker but I speak like a beginner when I'm conscious. I have friends who haven't gotten so technical with English and their rhythm is just perfect. Btw I'm a musician so rhythm for me is second nature.  I feel like my knowledge has become my curse you know.

* 1 comment should contain only 1 language. Format should be as follows: LANGUAGE - LINK + TEXT (OPTIONAL). Eg. French - http://vocaroo.com/------- Text:  J'ai voyagé à travers le monde pendant un an et je me suis senti perdu seulement quand je suis rentré chez moi.

languagelearning,What would you study: Japanese or Chinese Mandarin?,"First of all: each person has their own inspirations and reasons to learn a language and that might take an important role when deciding which language to learn. But which language would you choose to learn? I think of starting to study either japanese or chinese mandarin by the next year and I really don't know which one I should, because I am very interested in everything that revolves around both. Some thing that should be taken in consideration are:

* The number of speakers: According to Wikipedia, the total number of Standard Mandarin Chinese speakers is of 1.120 billion people (921 million native speakers + 198 million foreign speakers) while the total number of Japanese speakers is of only 126.5 million (126.3 million native speakers + 121.5 thousand foreign speakers) ...... this may be an advantage of a disadvantage, depending on your opinion and on your goals
* Simplified vs Traditional Chinese: Generally speaking, Singapore and the People's Republic Of China (mainland China) use Simplified Chinese while Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau use the Traditional Chinese for writing. This has historical roots and even though all of these countries have their own dialects or languages, it is important to keep this in mind if your goal is, for example, to learn chinese to work in a Taiwanese company.
* The difficulty of both languages: while for westerners both japanese and chinese look (and are) very hard to learn, they have their own difficulties. Standard Chinese, for example, has a very difficult spoken aspect: the tones. The way you pronounce a word or the small chunks of the  word can change its meaning a lot, and this takes some time to learn. Japanese doesn't have anything similar, but in counterpoint its grammar is WAY more complex in a million different ways.
* The number of characters you will have to memorize and the complexity of the writing system: In order to be completely fluent in reading/writing chinese you will have to learn about 3000 - 6000 characters. Even though this seems like a lot (because it is), setting smaller milestones such as the 300, or 600, or 1500 most used characters can put you in an advantage. Meanwhile although the Japanese system inherits some chinese characters in the form of Kanji, which you will need to know eventually about 1000 to 2000 to be perfectly able to understand everything, it also uses 2 alphabets: katakana and hiragana, each with their own rules and uses. As I said, chinese and japanese have its differences also on their writing systems and one might seem easier than the other to different people.
* The amount of resources: Even though nowadays it is relatively easy to find resources to study both languages, Japanese seems to have more material avaiable. It is known that immersing yourself in the language can make the process of learning more effective. This can be done while passively studying through movies, podcasts, tv shows... and animes. Animes are a great way to make learning japanese more efficient and more fun, and in general I believe it can be said that there are more resources and more Japanese media accessible for foreigners than Chinese.

So... which one would you like to study? I graduate from high school in december and I consider getting into the engineering field or perhaps the law field. Even though it wouldn't really help me for studying law, do you think studying chinese/mandarin could help me in the long run? Thank you :)",1627450950,raphaelmvg,86

languagelearning,Native vs Target Language Subtitles,"I've been living in China for about 2 years, but only actively studying the language for 6 months. I've recently started watching some Chinese TV shows, but usually use both the English and the pinyin subtitles to understand. It's kinda hard to read both at the same time when they're talking fast, so I usually end up just reading the English subtitles, but sometimes I feel like I probably could have understood without the English (definitely not all the time tho). 

I've never really tried to learn a language before, so I wanted to ask people more experienced than me if this is beneficial. Does listening to your target language and reading your native actually help? I get a lot of incomprehensible input living here in my daily life, so I feel like watching it only in pinyin and being unsure most of the time isn't that helpful. Should I watch once just with English subtitles and then a second time with pinyin? How do you use subtitles to improve when you're still a beginner? 

If you have any tips, I'd love to hear them. I've cobbled together resources and methods over the last 6 months, but it's been a lot of trial and error.",1627434860,getting-theroux-this,2

I live in California and I am debating between learning German or Hungarian.  I am a native English speaker who can also speak Spanish.  

German has more speakers but most of them are fluent in English.  When I go online looking for language partners, I noticed that Hungarians are far more responsive than Germans.  Hungarians are more supportive because few foreigners learn their language. 

I don’t plan to move to either country and I see myself staying in the USA for the time being.  I like the sound of German more and their music is better but Hungarians appear to be friendlier.  I also prefer German food more because I don’t like spicy dishes.  I like how Hungarian is not Indo-European and I think learning it will help me think in a different way.

To play around with that and keep myself entertained with the process of immersing I built this site: [https://bitesizefrench.com/amuse-bouche/balades-ep-1-lesson-7-new-years-resolutions/](https://bitesizefrench.com/amuse-bouche/balades-ep-1-lesson-7-new-years-resolutions/)

languagelearning,At which point do you move on from a book you are reading?,"When choosing which books to read as a B1/B2 learner, you have to rely on the opinions of other people.  
And you are not always going to know if   
a) you are going to like the book  
or b) if the book is going to be too difficult.  

Since long-time motivation is the most important thing in language learning, a) or b) would be good reasons to drop a book. You don't want to give up a language just because you forced yourself through a book you hate and lost all motivation in the process.

So there shouldn't be hesitation to drop books, but you also don't want to overdo it so that you never end up finishing anything. So my current rules are that I allow myself to drop the book:  
 
- in the first 50 pages: if the book is too difficult.  
- after 200 pages: if I don’t like the book.  

In Russian, this happened to me with Gogol, Saltykov-Shchedrin and Rubina (too difficult) and Salnikov, Ishimova (didn't like).

It's the second highest level test. The whole course goes for 2 hours every weekday and lasts until end of August. At first I thought perhaps something that intensive would considerably improve my Japanese.

Well I guess it made a difference but it's nearly August and I'm just absolutely burned out. What didn't help was that in June, the teacher decided to up the homework from weekly to daily. Writing homework and having to make a presentation about a topic isn't bad per se, but when it piles up so that you gotta do one about a random topic everyday, it really takes a toll on you. It doesn't help that the topics are very random and feels too much liked forced writing/speaking. My normal exposure before this class started was I watch anime without subtitles and read a lot of manga or light novels in Japanese. Now the fatigue is preventing me from getting as much exposure as I usually give myself and I find myself messing up so many Anki reviews. Are intensive classes usually like that?",1627356119,InsomniaEmperor,16

I have been looking to start learning one of the Celtic languages along side Finnish, and was wondering if some speakers of those languages could give me a sort of sales pitch for one of them.

languagelearning,Are there any reliable online vocabulary lists that you would recommend to help with learning the vocabulary in a language that you want to learn?,"Right now, I am interested in trying to learn German.

I got a book about the German language and while I feel like it will be useful in learning about the language, I feel like for me, the most useful thing that I could do before really getting into the book is spend some time learning some of the words. 

While the book has a few words defined in the back of the book, most of what it seems to have is a sentence in German and then the English translation of the sentence. I don't feel confident that if I am looking at the sentence and then the translation of the sentence into English that I will be connecting the right words together. For all I know with my complete lack of knowledge about the language, the words could be switched around a bit from how you would put them together in English and I could potentially mix them up if that was the case in at least some instances and think that some word means something that it does not just because the position in the sentence is different than in English.",1627348750,ACyclist1,1

languagelearning,Importance of good headphones?,"Reaching at least a decent level of voice quality is important to understand speech properly, but I was quite satisfied with my 20$ Sony headphones for the task. My 20$ earplugs on the other hand certainly offer less clarity, therefore making listening harder and unpleasant. 

A bigger problem may have been the lack of noise canceling feature which is either useless or critical. Even at home I found myself at times rewinding simply because a car passed by. Even worse if someone in the neighborhood fancies throwing a party. 

Anyway I decided to order a Q30 as an upgrade, which order should be justified merely for the noise cancelling feature, but it's also true that I can hear better than what my headphones can provide, so I am hoping the new ones will help me tell apart nuances better.

languagelearning,Warning about ChinesePod,"If you are considering a subscription to ChinesePod I highly discourage you from signing up. Here is my experience.

I had an automatic renewing annual subscription. The full cost is $249 a year. Now what often happens with these automatic renewals is that one forgets their renewal date and are accidentally charged. Well that happened to me. So after noticing it one day after the renewal date on my credit card, I kindly ask for a refund. 

Unfortunately for me, the ChinesePod customer support says that they can’t refund any portion of the $249 annual fee even one day after the renewal date.

Does this seem fair to you? Even though it’s technically in their terms and conditions that they don’t have to refund any portion, it seems incredibly short sighted to burn a formerly loyal customer because I forgot to cancel the subscription at some point last year. 

So if you’re considering ChinesePod I think you should reconsider. They’re not fair or understanding, in fact it’s actually quite exploitative to not give any warning to someone with an annual subscription then be so inflexible after the renewal.

My leisure time is usually composed of: 

\- Youtube

\- one episode of a series at night

\- random googling during the day. 

\- Audiobooks (if I'm commuting, but lately I'm not)  


The languages I've learnt had tons of quality materials. But here comes Russian. Could their series be any crappier? Anyone here found something that is NOT about murder cases ?

I know they have good movies, especially from the Soviet times. But for movies, you first: need to search for one, then watch it for 2hours, and it's usually pretty heavy-spirited. 

Audiobooks don't seem to be a thing in Russia, or at least I haven't found any. They do post Russian read American books on youtube that I sometimes listen to, but I'm still struggling to listen to them for a long period of time (maybe I'll try again when closer to a C1 level).

I find that the lack of quality media dampens the spirit as series tend to keep your love burning for a culture.

languagelearning,How do I get my future kids into college at 5 years old?,"I hear about kid prodigy's. I know these specific siblings who started at 11 years old to go to college. There's a few number of kids in the world who finish college with a B.A. by 11 to 18. I know the parents mentioned they enjoy learning. Which is awesome, but in order someone to enjoy learning you have to grow that. So I wondered if those parents gave everything they could into advancing them. They usually put them a science degree route.

I want my kids to learn fun things like foreign languages and music. I myself am working towards becoming a Foreign language teacher. 

How can I immerse them into school while also not robbing there childhood. I actually knew someone who was 18 and working toward there Ph.D. and my friend said that he was a little off as a person. Just a little. He seemed to enjoy T.V. like veggie tales. So I think there parents weren't to strict. 

I don't believe we should be restricted on how quick or fast we want to learn. 

I promise to keep them in my house by the time they are 30 years old so they can emotionally develop better as adults and function right. If they want to. 

It might be a controversial topic because some of you would want your own kids to experience differently. But this is my approach. So please give advice to my approach. Try not to ridicule it or completely give a different option. 

I also don't like the school system. I feel like if they introduced college in high school it would be better because were still trying to figure things out. I feel like if I put my future kids into college like at 5 or 10 years old they will explore so many beautiful things. 

I feel like this world we naturally feel like we don't fit in anyway and were all meant to be unique. I hope I don't sound strict or crazy. I'm just trying to give them more opportunity.

1) Russian - that one is quite hard for me since it's native and I can't look at it as studied language. I feel like ""Ж"" is a very charasteristic letter, other ideas are ""Б"", ""Ъ"", ""Д"", ""Я"".  
2) English - I feel like ""th"" is very characteristic for English and it's very hard for me to came up with literally anything else.  
3) French - I think circumflexed vowels looks quite characteristic for French, but so as for other languages. Another my thoughts are about ç or æ  
4) German - to me the most characteristic thing about german is ""ß"" or umlauts (like ""ö"").  
5) Spanish - quite obvious ""ñ"" for me, but I may be wrong about this one, don't know much about Spanish  
6) Arabic - same with Spanish, for me it's Alef ""أ""  
7) Hebrew - I know pretty much nothing about Hebrew, but it have very cool script and sound, so I would like to hear some ideas from Hebrew speakers  
8) Korean - I don't speak Korean at all, but I can sorta read Hangul. I'm not sure what character would look more ""korean-ish"" and be appropriate at the same time  
9 and 10) - Japanese and Mandarin. Well, first of all, it should be distinct from one another. I'm also not sure if Japanese supposed to be represented by Kanji or Kana. And there are tons of characters and I'm not sure about any of them

I just completed reading my 7th novel in my target language in the past 4 months. It's hard to explain to family and friends just how cool it feels to enjoy content that’s not in your native language and have it feel like it actually is. It's also very rewarding to see the progress. The first book I read (B1 level) went okay but took a while. This seventh novel that I just finished was twice as long and I finished it faster despite the extra length. B2 novels are also feeling much better. I can enjoy native podcasts and actually understand everything depending on the podcast and/or content of the episode. But most of all I love that I’ve been able to experience Mexican culture in a much deeper way. Language learning is one of the great unifiers or people, it really breaks down barriers and is pretty damn awesome.

I still have a long way to go before I would call myself truly bilingual, but the journey sure has been gratifying.

Now that it's over and I caught up on sleep, I want to share my experiences with it since I see questions about how much studying to do per day or per week every so often (as always, YMMV as everyone's circumstances are different).

1) Studying that much is not easy. In fact, I fell behind on Days 4+5 due to stress from a medical appointment and had to catch up on Days 6+7, which was kind of brutal.

2) Some methods/skills are easier to practise than others. Know how much brain and focus you need for each and try to plan the more difficult things earlier in your study session.

3) Frequent breaks! Go for a walk, meditate, play a game for half an hour, browse social media, anything to give your brain a short rest.

4) Having a study buddy is awesome! (We didn't study together but frequently talked during the week to share progress, air frustration, ...)

5) Short intense challenges like this can be a great motivator to get a LOT of studying done, but I sure was glad when it was over and I could take a day off to rest and do other stuff. Six hours a day would not be sustainable for me for an extended period of time, but I do know now that it is possible for a short while.

###Journal entries

**Monday** I take back what I said about ustedes, there appears to be a proper 2pl pronoun which is vosotros. But I'm I think that the conjugation of verbs might still be the same
for 2pl and 3pl, for son and estan at least. My current best guess for ustedes is that it's just a plural of usted, which is the polite version of the 2sg pronoun like
Ön is in Hungarian. (There is a similar distinction in German but I don't remember the word.) Except that if this is the case than it must be used in much less formal 
situations than it would be in Hungarian. Anyways, I listened to some Spanish Spanish for practically the first time and it definitely impacts my comprehension.
I can't really pin-point any difference other than the fact that it's just harder to understand and that it has a th sound in place of an s sound when it's written with a c

**Tuesday** I came to a point where I almost never notice myself learning new words like I did in the beginning. This actually comforts me somewhat because this is what my experience with
immersion in other languages has been like, in fact, I was very surprised in the beginning by how conscious I was of the process, but now I can just sit back and let my
subconscious do the work. I will still make conscious guesses about the grammar purely because it's fun, I don't actually expect it to take me anywhere. I don't even find
myself guessing the meanings of words that I recognise all the time but don't know yet, the two that annoy me the most currently are 'ya' and 'se'. Furthermore I think I might
be starting to develop an intuitive sense of the difference between 'estás' and 'ser' which are the two main ways of expressing 'to be' for example 'estoy bien' sounds
much better than 'soy bien' and when giving your name 'soy' sounds better, but this is not at the point where either of them would sound wrong to me, yet.

**Saturday** It appears that a lot of scenes were censored in Dragon Ball. The problem is that they just staight up leave those parts in Japanase on every site I tried. 
Dragon ball Z seems to have a lot less censored scenes and they are also subtitled in Spanish, so what I do is I rip my headphones off my head when one these scenes
start, read the subtitles and put my headphones back on after the subs stop coming. I still count this as Audiovisual though because switching categories is a pain,
and it happens rarely enough that it should be negligible. On a completely unrelated I figured out a few days ago that the word for 'tomorrow' and 'morning' is the same.
I thought that this would be terribly confusing, but to my surprise it's really not, at least I didn't have any problems with it these past few days.


**Sunday** Rating content on my scale every week actually helps a lot with my motivation. Without it I don't think I'd notice any improvement, they force me to think more concretely
about how well I'm actually doing instead of just thinking 'yeah I understand some but not all', it makes me appreciate progress that I otherwise wouldn't even notice.
More great news: throughout the week I've been trying watching a bit of several different shows from my childhood and I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to choose 'easy content'
without much trouble, which has been a major source of stress so far. Yeah sure Nagatoro and H2O were great but I would dread the time they would be over because I had 
no guarantee that I'd find more things that are as 'easy'. This is not a problem anymore and I'm very happy, because honestly, this was the worst part of the experiment.",1627209305,faceShareAlt,34

Here's the thing : I learned Italian for 7 years and I stopped having lessons when I got into college. I was not bad at it but if I remember well it was quite difficult for me to talk and have a real discussion with Italian people, even after 7 years. Now, I forgot the majority of it, to not say everything.
Anyway, I really want to re-learn Italian.

Italian is the only language I learned at school that I don't remember. I don't know how the memory works when it's about languages but I honestly think that if I read, listen or watch in Italian daily it would be quick, easy for me to remember it. I also think it's more a vocabulary problem than anything else.

So, I'm here to ask you if you can give me ideas of easy books to read for a new start or even with an intermediate level. Even series would be great ! If you have any advises, I'll take them. I'd really appreciate it!",1627206131,bluemelcupcake,3

languagelearning,"What EXACTLY are the ""fixed stages of language learning"" according to SLA-theory?","Dear all, 

So according to Second Language Acquisition researchers, ALL human beings learn languages according to fixed stages which are the same for everybody. E.g. I remember Bill VanPatten mentioning that the singular is ALWAYS learned before the plural and that this seems to be built into all human beings [after minute 54 in this video https://youtu.be/vsX7ADtB2Pg ]. 

I recall Krashen making a similar case, i.e. that it is futile to ""learn"" and ""correct"" (consciously) say the instrumental case, when you haven't yet ""acquired"" it (subconsciously). And if you haven't acquired the instrumental case yet, this is only because your level of proficiency hasn't reached the stage where it's ready to incorporate said instrumental case within its subconscious map of the language. 

Long story short: there are certain fixed stages of language acquisition. My question is: What EXACTLY are these stages? 

When I look around on the internet, I find e.g. that babies start ""recognising words at 9 months"" or that they start ""babbling loose words"" at X months. But this is not what I should like to know. I want to know the EXACT stages of syntax/morphology/grammar that learners go through according to SLA-theory. E.g. the singular always comes before the plural. What about tenses? What about verb modes? Does the imperative come before the indicative? Where do pre-/postpositions come in? 

Looking forward to any suggestions!

languagelearning,New language learning app on its way.,"Hi Redditors. My name is Victor I'm a professional software developer (currently working on a YCombinator Startup, in case you are interested) and have language learning as a hobby. Some time ago I used to be an active member of SharedTalk, HelloLingo, SharedLingo - language exchange communities, they were basically real-time chats to practice your target language(s). Unfortunately those places were closed and it's been some time since a new one.

I tried alternatives such as HelloTalk or Tandem, but failed, since in my humble opinion they are language learning Tinder, I send a lot of messages to practice and receive no response :/. I also tried Discord but it's hard to find communities that have active members, and many people don't even know about Discord.

So I decided to build a new one called Polylingo, it will be basically a language learning community where you will have the ability to chat person to person, or in groups instantly, also I'm thinking on a lot of features that will be added (since I would love Polylingo to grow and have many language learning mini apps and resources), such as Notebook, Logger, (how many time you spend on such things and have a record of your language learning activity), Gamification etc.

Here is the website: [https://polylingo.io/](https://polylingo.io/) it's basically a landing so you can pre-register, it would mean the world to me if you pre-register so I know this is something worth building.

I would also love to hear from you:

Also if you are a developer and would like to help me (mostly frontend, or mobile) develop the app, it would be awesome, or you have marketing skills, or there is anything you would like to help with, I would really appreciate it.

I am looking to learn French and I am eager to find the most efficient study plan. I am 28 years old and bilingual English/Italian. I learned Italian as a child in school from the age of 8 to 18. I don't know if I can become fluent in French so easily but I am willing to try. I have been studying for 4 days.

I bought a subscription to Busuu because I feel it's better than Duolingo. I've done 30-45 minutes a day on the app, doing 4 or 5 lessons and reviewing grammar and vocabulary. In the evenings I watch a French tv series on Netflix with English subs. Around 3 episodes a night. On Mondays in NYC there's a French language conversation/apéro group that I plan to visit. I have already been once.

It doesn't feel like much, especially compared to my years of studying Italian, which were structured-lesson heavy, about 3 hours a week. How could I improve my study plan considering also that I plan to be getting back to work soon. What kinds of things can I do and for how long should I do them?

you guys seemed to enjoy my last free book (if you still want to read it, message me!) but I have created another book. This one focuses on stories and how to learn languages through stories. Stories are a fantastic and fun way to pick up new vocabulary. The book has 50 short stories in Arabic, and they are then translated into English. the book is catered for beginners/intermediate learners.

If you would like to read my new book, and would again be willing to leave me a review on Amazon once it launches, I would be more than happy to send you a book arc!

Also, in terms of my other book ""Arabic made easy - 100 verbs in context"" the audiobook production for that is in the last stages, so it should be available soon! that book is also very beneficial, and its more catered to complete beginners, who want to learn how to read and write. if you would likewise want that audiobook for free, please do let me know from early, as I know the codes will go very quickly for that one.

My first language is Portuguese and I remember one of the main exercises I had at school when I was a child was an exercise where we learn all the alphabet by hearing, writing down and repeating out loud each and every possible syllable. 

We did it a lot, all that process with all the alphabet. We started from B to z like this:

Ba - Be - Bi - Bo - Bu - bão 

Ca - Co - Cu - Cão

(…)

Ça, Ce, Ci, Ço, Çu, Ção

Cha, Che, Chi, Cho, Chu, Chão

Etc. 

We had these along with example words like for Ba we have ""Batata"", for Be we have ""Beliscão"", etc.

languagelearning,How to handle hurdles around learning a new and very different language?,"Hello! Before discussing the issue, some background: my native tongue is French and I have five years of language learning experience with Romance, Germanic (especially), and Slavic languages. The only non-Indo-European languages I've studied are Finnish and Northern Saami. I stopped dabbling two years ago and I spent 2020 awkwardly learning Russian, still focusing on it since it's extremely important to me. I decided to add another language since I got bored with Russian and I want challenges. Hence I chose Turkish, which I need anyway. 

I'm facing a set of unexpected hurdles, though. Despite being on my third day, I'm not motivated any more and I'm struggling to even find discipline. I somehow forgot how to ""get into"" learning a new language since I got so used to only doing Russian. And as you may know, Turkish has a very alien grammar compared to Indo-European languages. I thought I could battle it like I did Finnish (which to me was actually easy) but I was proved wrong. I'm trying to write short texts (WriteStreak) but it's a nightmare. I must check every single word like five times, then check three or five different resources for grammar, then I'm confused because they offer different ways, and I can't even remember new words despite repeating them and writing them using my usual techniques (which work well with Russian). I end up bored and I stop doing progress (were I anyway?). 

This sounds silly because no one should expect to do enormous progress within a mere three days of learning a very different language, but I kinda have always been extremely self-demanding and ambitious. I'm stuck because I'm trying to apply my Russian method and this obviously doesn't really work out that well. One of my pillars is writing a lot but I can't even do that since I barely know 20 or so Turkish words, grammar resources are confusing and contradictory, and I'm just unsure about what to do since all usual solutions barely work. 

Spontaneously, I'd say I should first focus on loads of listening and reading but that's boring to me: I can do that for 15 minutes but then I get bored and I just want to speak and write, and I can't however hard I try. I just spent 30 minutes trying to figure out a simple Turkish expression to try writing my daily text and I got fed up. Meanwhile, within 30 minutes, I could easily and spontaneously write a text in Russian. 

I'm sure many fellow language learners have been through similar issues. How did you solve them? Do you have any advice for people going through them? Perhaps also specific recommendations when learning a language pretty different from your native one?

I’ve been looking into learning North Sami as a sort of heritage language. My great grandmother is from the furthest reaches of Sweden and speaks it natively and moved to the US during WWII. She is pretty much the only speaker left in my family and they are very few speakers in the world (estimated ~15-25k as of the most recent census I could find). How do people find resources to learn these fairly endangered languages? Is it even reasonably possible to consider yourself fluent one day? I’m really interested in keeping these smaller languages alive as I’m sure many of you are.  Northern Sami isn’t even the most endangered language in “Sami” region. Other languages up there are measured in the tens or hundreds of still living native speakers.

Basically has anyone else gone through the process of learning one of the thousands of endangered languages in the world? How did you source materials and would you consider yourself conversationally fluent? This isn’t just for the languages of the Sami region, but for all the hundreds of Native North and South American languages, the hundreds of African languages, South Asian and Polynesian languages, and all the much smaller languages being slowly killed off in Europe.

Over the past few years, since I haven't been studying English, it's gotten quite rusty.

I'm somewhat able to apply grammatical rules, but I absolutely can't remember how the rule goes, nor could I ever explain it to someone else.

So, my question is, what's the best way to brush up on grammar a bit? I hate In Use series, so would Destination C1-C2 do the job? Since I'd like to take the CAE exam (at first I aimed at CPE, but when I realised how rusty I actually am, I backed off) should I go straight to the Objective Advanced? Would that be sufficient?

At this very moment we have almost 900 users, native speakers of 40 different languages of the region and this number is steadily growing!

[https://discord.gg/8xyHnKtmTq](https://discord.gg/8xyHnKtmTq)

The languages, which the server and its channels focus on, include:

\- **All major Germanic languages** (even Frisian or Faroese)

\- **All Slavic languages**! (even Sorbian or Ruthenian!)

\- **All major Romance languages** (including Catalonian and Occitan)

\- **Turkish**

\- **Greek**

\- **Albanian**

\- **Lithuanian** and **Latvian**

\- **Hungarian**

\- **Finnish** and **Estonian**

\- **Basque**

We're also planning to branch out to other languages of the region (Georgian, Armenian, Yiddish) as well, depending on the users demand. Now they can be freely used in #aliæ (other) channel, but they are going to have its own channels soon!

How are we different from the other servers?

1. Simple rules including ***the ban on speaking in English***, which means that the server is not about general conversations in English, but about actually learning the languages. However, every language other than English can be freely used.
2. We are not a server for all languages of the world, we focus on a specific region, so there is also a room for the less popular languages, unlike on the other servers, where such languages are put into the ""other"" channel. There could be a channel even for any minority language, as long as it will be active.",1627117710,Semorod,1

languagelearning,Is reading more efficient than listening for getting new vocabulary and grammar topics?,"TLDR at end

I always hear people talking about that people should read more and if one wants to get a vocabulary through natural ways they should read, but can listening be as efficient as reading? I’ve always had a harder time with reading in German and Spanish. For context, I started studying Spanish in 1st grade and I had terrible spelling in both English and Spanish but it improved till 8th grade which was my last year, I had a couple years of a break but than started up again and while the listening came back quite fast ( recognizing words in rap songs after hearing them for first time after 2 weeks and watching master chef Mexico after 3 months) I was dependent on text to speech and speech to text for the first 5-6 months. Everyone says that Spanish has easy spelling, but even after 9 months I still mix up e and a, e and i , and s and c. I can hear and use acabar, reír, valer, and necesitar in speech, but deciding what sounds go to -er, -ar, or -ir and oft it’s s, c, or z, can be a nightmare. Wanting to progress without all the struggle, I start listening to native content really early on with German starting after a1 and for Spanish, during a2. I find Anki and flash cards too boring so listening to YouTube videos has really been my main method for German and after 2 years and over 1000 hours of YouTube with no subtitles I can understand 95-99% of most videos I watch and am only semi recently picking up books. I of course also look up some 1-5 words a day that I had heard and grammar topics once I notice them, but I haven’t done cards for more than a week at a time and haven’t done grammar excersises. Im not saying it’s the best as it takes much time but I got somewhere so... However as I repick Spanish up, I want it to be more efficient as I actually have a deadline (AP Spanish test) I’ve already gotten about 100 hours of YouTube and crime shows this past 2 months, but would it be more beneficial to go through the struggles of picking up literacy now to possibly learn more vocabulary in the end or should I just continue my strategy of getting vocabulary through videos and pick up reading once I know more words so I don’t have to battle learning how to read, picking up grammar, and learning new words at the same time? Even though English is my native language and they share the same script, I find it hard to see words as made up of individual sounds and putting these sounds to letters, dyslexia problems I guess.

TLDR: the actual skill of reading is harder than listening for me, so should I continue as having listening as my main focus or would it be more beneficial to try to better my reading skills if the brain theoretically can learn in the end more words through reading than listening?

I don’t know if it seems as though I keep on changing my main question throughout the text so I’m sorry in advance, I’m not the best at putting things together in a coherent manner sometimes.",1627068440,Free_shavacado606,28

I'm autistic and I have difficulty describing my level of Spanish because while I'm up to a B2 in reading comprehension and a progressing B1 when it comes to writing and listening, my speaking ability is much lower. A part of this is because I haven't had much of an opportunity to talk with native Spanish speakers, but a part of it is also because I'm not good at speaking *any* language due to how fast I talk and how much I stumble upon syllables and words, obviously due to being neurodivergent. This is a problem for me even when it comes to two of native languages (English and Tagalog, especially the latter) and is only not a problem in my other native one, Hokkien, because all the words are monosyllabic. 

I'm sure other people here have disabilities that can affect their ability to speak, especially when it comes to a foreign language, and that there are likewise people with difficulties when it comes to hearing/reading/writing for similar reasons. My question is: how do you measure how far you've come with a language if this is the case? Do you still use CEFR or other standard learner levels? Do you disregard the respective component of the language you have trouble with? Or do you just eschew these levels all together since they're not accessible to us?

Brit with no formal education in languages, still rather keen to learn it, but feeling really burned out by a lack of progress.

I've been learning languages for a number of years and I've reached fluency in three (discarding my native language).

It goes somehow like this. When I learn Russian for a few days, I fear missing out on Japanese. So, I then switch to other one, and then the same thoughts plague me. I've been jumping around for months. I thought that with time I would make a decision, but I have gotten more undecisive. Unwillingly, I've been learning the two because of this. I even force my schedule for it. This has caused me certain anxiety. I don't know why I am so fixated on this problem. The thing is I wasn't like that.

languagelearning,"My native language makes me uneasy and anxious, and I don't know why","Hello, I'm sorry if it's the wrong subreddit, I've no idea where to go to. It's a very weird and specific case and I'm lost. It's sort of on topic and not at the same time.

I'm a french guy, 24, my native language is French, and in most situations, reading it or hearing it makes me absolutely uneasy, cringe, and stressed. I literally can't explain it, and I really wish it didn't make me feel this way.

It makes it really hard to express myself to people that only know French. Most of the time I simply don't talk. I used to have a therapist for unrelated issues and there were so many things I never spoke about because I couldn't bring myself to in French. Not that i would even know how to express myself in French because English comes first to me. I've gotten so much worse with French.

I can type it without feeling bad only with my brother and that's pretty much it. If I'm forced to with other people, I'll feel so bad inside. I usually can verbally speak it with strangers, but if it's typing then I'll want to nope out immediately.

I do absolutely everything in English, for years now. And as soon as I witness some French, my guts get twisted, and I have to distract myself asap. Sometimes I try to peak again to force myself and it never improves overtime no matter how many times I try.

My only guess is that repeated trauma that happened in French, while I was learning English on my own, is the reason for making me feel this way? And that me doing everything in English now could almost be like living another life, a much safer one? English also has opened so many doors to me, countless of ones, some that made me grow and understand myself better, some to be able to interact with the entire world with no more language barrier, etc, and I'm so grateful for it. 

Anyway I've never heard of anyone being anxious about their mother tongue so I have no articles to look up to. To be vague, my different traumas are physically related, school related, and multiple deaths in short span of time.
(I wasn't near fluent in English back then, if that matters.)

At this point I don't even know if I want to reclaim French. I keep trying and yet... I feel like the few exceptions where I'm fine with French are the maximum possible I can have and can never improve.

It gets to the point of thinking ""If I lived a life without French existing, I'd be happier"" and that's really weird to realize. Especially since well ... I live in France.

I'm still happy to know French, because it has a few good things, and languages in general are fascinating and if I had been a native English speaker instead I'd have struggled to learn French lmao so I'm glad I know it. But witnessing French is a Russian roulette for me, with so many more scenarios where I'll feel really anxious than scenarios where I'll be fine. I'd say 85% bad 15% good. Like another good example is that I love to help people that are learning French. This I don't mind, I guess because I am the one that proposed to help, the one that offered and willing.

On social media, usually you place your spoken languages in your bio to let your followers know, but it has come to me not putting FR at all. Only EN. I don't want people to come at me and start speaking French because I'd get uncomfortable. And then sometimes I feel like putting FR because I should try and let people know who I am still, only for me to remove it days again later because I can't risk people coming at me with French.

This post I'm writing, I've been wanting to do it for years but kept postponing because I kept hoping it'd get better, but guess what? It's literally because I once again today had to read French out of nowhere, without warning, felt uneasy and weird, and decided ""stop, I need answers"".

I'm sorry if the post doesn't make sense and goes back and forth with infos, it's 1AM.

I just want opinions I guess ... I don't know at this point.

I'd also happily repost this in a better subreddit if you know one better suited for it.",1626994920,2Zzephyr,31
languagelearning,How do you overcome days where you aren't motivated,"**Brief Intro first:**
I have been studying Brazilian Portuguese for about 8 months now, and it has been great. My main reason for studying now is to be able to talk fluently with my girlfriends parents in Brazil - hopefully by the end of the year. I did a language test on iTalki and Preply, both put me at a B1. I currently have a lesson with a tutor 3 times a week (1 hour per session) and then I try to do some extra work as well (e.g. immersion, speaking with natives etc.)


**The Question: How do you overcome days where you aren't motivated?**
For about the last week, my ""motivation"" hasn't been great, it has slowly been getting me down. I noticed that I was making some really basic mistakes that I haven't made in a long time, or ever. I would know what I am trying to say is wrong, but I couldn't think of what was correct. I would then remember at a later stage in the day, and want to kick myself. Then I started noticing it while speaking, I had this feeling that I wasn't at the level I should be, or I wasn't making the progress I should be. 

I understand that the further on in a language you go and the higher your level, it's take a lot more to progress and see that progression. I decided to talk with my teacher about it, and some friends/colleagues about it, even though I knew what they would be saying, I felt it would be better to get it off my chest - I suppose this post serves that purpose as well now.

When you have had these types of days/weeks/months, how have you managed to get through them? Did you do anything specifically? I am going to carry on learning, but also remember to take breaks and not overwork myself, but I am interested in what the community has done as well.",1626992481,GovernorKeagan,10

Also I don't find myself interested in most things people talk about so I have nearly zero common topics that I could use to break the ice.


At first that wasn't an issue until I started learning French for sometime now and also take my English speaking to a better level so I downloaded discord and omg It's been a month now with still no use lol.

languagelearning,The most useful languages to know,"It has been said often enough here that this alone isn't a good thing to base your choice of what language to learn on, but still you've probably wondered at some point: Which language is the most useful to know? With what collection of languages would I get the most coverage? So I decided to take some time to research the answer and thought I'd share the result.

------------------

Firstly I just went through all the continents and see what languages popped up the most. For some continents this is pretty straightforward. 

With the Americas, the north is almost entirely **English** (in Canada this is combined with **French**). In the south it's mostly **Spanish**, plus **Portuguese** in Brazil. 

In Africa it's very roughly 1/3 **Arabic**, 1/3 **French**, 1/3 **English** and some **Portuguese**. Africa has a lot of small and often fairly isolated languages too, but the one mentioned are considered ""the business language"" of the countries. (The Arabic part continues on into the middle east too).

Europe and Asia are basically just chaos of many languages. The most notable ones for Europe are **German** and **Russian**, since they are the official or secondary language of a good number of countries. In Asia the only one that really stands out in size is **Mandarin (Chinese)**. But it should be noted that this is almost exclusively because of China’s high population. It has few secondary speakers.

------------------

Next I looked at with languages had the most speakers (favoring secondary over native). These were: **English**, **Mandarin**, **Hindi**, **Arabic**, **French**, **Spanish**, **Indonesian**, and **Russian**.

-----------------

Then I looked at what countries were considered to be the most “powerful” or culturally influential. There was a pretty common consensus on to following countries: United States, China, Russia, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan. And a few mentions of: India, Brazil, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Spain.

This gives us the following languages: **English**, **Mandarin (Chinese) **, **Russian**, **German**, **French**, **Italian**, **Japanese**, (**Hindi**, **Portuguese**, **Korean**, **Arabic**, **Spanish**)

-----------------

And finally, just generally which languages other sources considered to be the most useful: **Mandarin (Chinese)**, **Spanish**, **German**, **French**, **Arabic**, **Portuguese**, **Russian** and **Japanese**.

----------------

So as you can see on all fronts it comes out pretty clear which languages are the most useful. 

I’ve listed them down here below, along with how much time an English speaker approximately needs to learn the language (according to [effectivelanguagelearning.com]( https://effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/language-difficulty/)).

I am currently an international business student in France. We all had to choose 3 languages. I picked English, Chinese and spanish. 
My native language is French but I used to understand Lingala as well as a child (Congolese born and raised in France). I almost forgot everything and I need to learn it again . I also studied Korean and German in highschool (along with english and Spanish that at started at the time).

The thing is that I do not improve in any of these languages except the one that I have to study for college. And even there my grades are not that good comparing to the level of the other student in the class. I am progressing extremely slowly.

I would say that I am B2 in english, A2/B1 in chinese and spanish, A2 in lingala, A1 in German and I only know the alphabet and some basics expression in Korean.

I tried lot of different methods : assimil, expensives grammar books, translating song lyrics, pimsleur, lingodeer, fluentU, hello Chinese, mandla, drops, rosetta stones and duolinguo. The result is always the same : I give up after a few month losing motivation because i don't improve at all.

I'm 45 now and have been coding since I was 15.  The KEY thing I never did was I never really sat down and read a book trying to memorize the terms.

I just started doing it and using the language in practice.

Now the syntax and grammar of a programming language is far simpler than human/spoken language but I think the strategy could be apt for language learning.

I've been trying to do this over the years and when I watch TV I try to remember words, key terms, etc.

I'm in Mexico now and trying to learn Spanish and my comprehension is much higher.

I think there's a CORE basic language strategy here to basically learn key phrases like hello, goodbye, and then also temporal words like before and after and then basic verbs, past/future tense, and pluralization rules.

I THINK if you can learn this core, then you can communicate in a VERY basic version of the language you're targeting.

At this point you can order food, shop at stores, etc.  

When you're confused you can just communicate at the BASIC level and ask help to find the right spanish word, or explain the word you want. 

Is there a formal strategy for this?  It seems to be working for me and I'm working on a spreadsheet to help define this core.

I went to a normal Gymnasium and learnt alongside the German pupils, I also regularly got fairly good grades in German (B to B+).

languagelearning,Language Learning Resources I've Seen No One Mention!!,"Ok so I've been in the language learning community for a good while. I've been here long enough to be following a lot of polyglots and language learners on social media, and I've also spent A LOT of time  online trying to find some free resources and sites to learn languages (bc I am poor T-T).

And here are two sites I've found that are not specific to any one language, but they seem like treasure troves (in my humble opinion) if you're looking for free stuff:

\- [pdfdrive.com](https://pdfdrive.com)

\- language lab McGraw-Hill app

[Pdfdrive.com](https://Pdfdrive.com) contains pdfs (obviously). On there, you can look for grammar books and even story books in your target language! This is not a 100% guarantee that you will find books for your target language, but there's a pretty vast selection of books on there, so it's really worth a try. It's pretty easy and all you have to do is search for your book, download it, and then you're done.

Language lab McGraw-Hill is an app that you can find on the app store! It has textbooks, audios, flashcards, and reviews &amp; quizzes (depending on the language you chose). To my knowledge, you do not have to sign in or have an account, all you need to do is be ready to learn! However, unlike pdfdrive, it contains a small selection of languages. Those languages are French, German, Italian, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese (I guess I should say they also have English grammar books, but they're mostly in English so....). These books (and the app) were created by McGraw-Hill which is an educational publishing company that creates textbooks for public schools in the USA (to my knowledge). It seems pretty credible, and worth a try in my opinion.

I thought that I should reiterate that this post is for people like me who want to learn a language but don't have the money to pay for subscriptions or lessons. Again, this isn't guaranteeing anything, but these are 100% free resources you should definitely check out and hopefully these will be helpful to you in some way.

I really hope this helps, and I also hope no one has said this before me! (if so here's a reminder I guess lol)",1626914731,CodaBoda78,7
languagelearning,My personal language learning guide,"Hi all,

I made a language learning guide that I’d like to share. It basically talks about the process that I used to learn Spanish, plus a few other ideas, but it’s about language learning in general. It’s a continuous work in progress, and will always be, but I’ve been comfortable sharing its current state with people. 

Please feel free to take a look and post comments here with any questions. Critiques to the guide and to the strategies themselves are welcome as well because I’m learning too. Please excuse typos and the occasionally awkward writing structure, as I update this guide regularly so I’ll probably find the issue eventually.

BTW, for any busy health professionals out there looking to learn a language for their work — please start with the “Making A Study Plan” section, then go back to the beginning and read it straight through. I am a big advocate for language education for medical professionals in training and in practice.

Hope it’s helpful to somebody out there. 

Best wishes everyone!

I'm not writing this to brag about it (ok, just a little) but as a way to keep myself motivated and to hopefully motivate others to start and continue studying flashcards. At first I was really sceptical about the benefits of using flashcards because I had firmly believed that vocabulary needs to be learned in context, but it just didn't work in Korean. I had problems reading even the simplest of the sentences, and it was frustrating to check the dictionary every couple of words.

 I discovered Anki and downloaded Evita's deck and decided that I wouldn't stop until I learned at least 2000 words and here I am! The results are amazing! It may sound like an infomercial but it really made a HUGE difference. I even changed the language of Firefox to Korean! I started watching cartoons in Korean and I discovered that my listening skills improved a little, mainly because now I can recognise more words. 

So, if you're wondering whether using flashcards is worth trying, it definitely is!

languagelearning,I would like advice about when to start talking in my target language.,"Hello everyone! I have been learning Spanish by myself for \~8 months now and have a question about when to start speaking. The way I have been learning Spanish is mainly through ""immersion"" (I understand everyone has a different definition of what they'd call immersion). Basically almost all of the media I consume is in Spanish. When I first started studying Spanish I would only watch Dreaming Spanish videos. I fell in love with the method of learning they teach on this channel however I've seen many people on this sub go against a lot of the stuff the channel recommends. Specifically, when to start talking.  Pablo Ramón, the person behind dreaming Spanish, has a ""language learning roadmap"" for those learning solely through comprehensible input. He recommends not speaking until one has about about 700 hours of comprehensible input under their belt in order to have a good, clear accent. I am not sure where I would place myself as far as hours of input go, however falling the language learning roadmap I'd place myself somewhere in between 150-300 hours (most likely lower in this range). Now I have not ONLY done comprehensible input so far. I am currently working through Assimil Spanish and have just gotten to the 50th lesson. I have also completed 17 one hour iTalki lessons, I'd say about half of them I was not speaking though (Crosstalk or Storytelling) as well as attended a Mextalki conversation club. I enjoyed the Mextalki conversation club a lot (this was recently probably last month), I was paired up with learners of my level (I believe I am upper a2 possibly lower b1, however I went with the a1-a2 group) and a teacher that guided us through some questions and we'd all have turns answering them (I think the theme that week was related to work, questions related to jobs, careers, etc.). I had some difficulty speaking of course but I was able to get my point across. I would love to continue doing iTalki lessons and or the Mextalki conversation club however my fear of English bleeding into my Spanish is very high, I'm not talking just about accent (however that is a concern too) I'm talking about the ways in which I construct sentences. My iTalki tutors as well as the Mextalki tutor I had have pointed out the weird ways I will sometimes say things as it's my English constructions coming over to my Spanish. This fear of talking has also turned into a fear of reading. I recently started reading a book that I loved in my youth, now in Spanish, and was getting through it pretty well albeit slow. I ended up stopping reading in Spanish because I'm not pronouncing everything perfectly in my head. I now have restricted myself to ONLY watching (videos) and listening (podcasts). I am still watching Dreaming Spanish videos as I pay for the Patreon and have access to a very wide range of videos as well as the audio transcript for all of them on my podcasts app. However I have very recently (last week) started transitioning less from Spanish content aimed at Spanish learners like Dreaming Spanish, Easy Spanish, etc. and more to native content for natives.  Once I started learning Spanish I fell in love with the process of language learning and do not intend to stop at just Spanish. Although, Spanish is my favorite language and I can see myself living in or at the very least spending a significant amount of time in a Spanish speaking country (I'm in love with Mexico!) so my end result with Spanish vs any other language is going to be the most important to me. This is something I am very new to, and living in US I can count on one hand the people I know that can speak another language other than English so I don't have much of a community to fall back on for advice like this. I have a Brazilian friend who learned English almost solely through comprehensible input (I assume other than his formal teaching in school that he may or may not have gotten?) however he was not scared of talking and talked as soon as he could. However, he has a pretty heavy accent that people can have trouble understanding sometimes. To me, his accent has gotten better over the years (he's been in the US since 2018 ish) but I am not sure if that is just because I have gotten used to the way he speaks. When I asked him if he thinks his accent has improved since he moved to the US he said no or not on a level he can notice. This is the final language scare I got that led to me ending speaking and reading for now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, some days I feel like my Spanish comprehension is pretty good, and other days my Spanish comprehension is pretty bad / way worse. Sometimes I'm understanding so much of something it really surprises me and fills me with a sense of pride. Other times however I am understanding so little it makes me feel pretty bad. I guess I notice this most when watching TV shows (I recently watched all of Castlevania on Netflix and would be at very high levels of comprehension in some episodes and very low in others). I was wondering if this was something other language learners face? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for taking the time to read, I'd love anyone's input on this matter. Am I being too irrational by not speaking or reading? Or am I justified in my idea of holding off speaking and reading until I have more listening hours in and have a firmer grasp on the sounds of the language? Thanks again!

Spacing out is excusable, I do that in English all the time. Talking to natives that even other natives struggle to understand is another excusable situation.

But I mean, like, zero genuine comprehension issues for the vast majority of your average native’s speech. Truly native level comprehension. Like it feels like you’re listening to L1.

(I know, this is such a vague question because native level comprehension is such a vague term, but still, try to answer the question.)

If you feel like you’ve gotten there or gotten quite close, can you share what it required you to get there? I want to get there, and it drives me nuts that I just…. Idk, my listening skills are actually really good, just not like super mega ultra good, nomsay’n?

I feel like only people who are learning English have excellent chances of getting there due to English being so heavily used in so many sectors of life and especially those areas where people are trying to get ahead in life. I’m trying to get there with Spanish, and I just….

I know Spanish in particular is notorious for being especially difficult in terms of listening comprehension, with natives having difficulties understanding other natives, and I’ve heard of people learning both Spanish and non-Spanish languages that find that listening comprehension is noticeably much in non-Spanish languages, often getting to native-like levels much more quickly and easily. I guess the softened consonants and high speed of Spanish is killer.

Regardless of what languages you’ve learned, I’d like to hear how long it took until you felt your listening comprehension in each language genuinely fit the C2 description: “I have no difficulty in understanding any kind of spoken language, whether live or broadcast, even when delivered at fast native speed, provided I have some time to get familiar with the accent.”

languagelearning,Good tutors that don't master grammar,"There's this little thing I've been struggling with lately : I've been taking tutoring classes with a Colombian tutor to learn spanish through conversation and comprehensible input, and I feel like compared to other tutors I have I've really managed to progress a lot with him.

However, there's one thing I struggle with : sometimes I'll ask him something grammatical that bugs me and he'll give me a half-relevant answer that seems to circumvent and avoid the question (for example, today I asked why some spanish verbs are directly connected to the infinitive like 'tengo que lograr entender este examen' whereas others need a 'de' like 'acabo de escribir mis respuestas' and he just gave me a vague description of 'de' as a preposition of origin and content/material which doesn't work with verbs).

The problem is I can't bring myself to tell them that that wasn't the point of my question because I don't want to bring about the awkward situation of making them admit they don't master that part of the grammar.

languagelearning,"Persian ""synonyms,"" and bookish vs. colloquial vocab","Hello! (crossposting from r/farsi)

I've been studying Persian for quite some time, but I'm at a point now where I'm having to grapple with tons and tons of ""synonyms."" Part of this wealth of synonyms seems to be that some words are considered ""bookish,"" by speakers, i.e. only used in writing or in very formal registers, while others are used more commonly in day-to-day situations.

For example, another Persian learner here said a while ago that for the verb ""to try,"" it would be common to use تلاش کردن or سعی کردن, whereas the verb کوشش کردن would sound ridiculous in a casual setting – only in formal writing would one see that verb.

My issue is that I don't really have any way of knowing for sure which words are ""bookish"" and which are acceptable for casual conversation, unless I were to ask a Persian speaker. But I'm dealing with hundreds of such words. I try to read Persian instagram comments or memes to get a feel for the colloquial language, which does help, but just because I see one word being used more often than another doesn't mean I can simply conclude that the other synonyms must be ""bookish."" Maybe I just haven't seen them being used yet, or they have a slightly different connotation.

So, does anyone know of any Persian dictionaries, thesauruses, or other resources that mark when a word is ""bookish,"" or at least go into a bit more detail on the connotations a word has when compared to its other synonyms, so I can at least know if/when some of them are essentially interchangeable? It doesn't have to be Persian &gt; English, even a Persian &gt; Persian book would do. Any other tips/guidance you have is welcome. I'd love to know whether/when to use پایه، اساس، بنیاد، پی، or موسسه for ""foundation"" or دانش، علم، معرفت or شناخت for ""knowledge"" for example.

(Btw, I know some here may say ""don't waste time on this, just learn the words you hear most often and the rest will come as it may,"" and I know that's sound advice, but being able to identify and mentally separate the vocabulary of these two registers is a personal goal of mine.)

languagelearning,Is it better to learn a language with a group of learners or individually?,"All other things being equal, assuming you are learning a language from scratch and seeking to get to a B2/C1 level is it better to learn it on a one to one basis with a dedicated tutor or in a formal group setting with multiple learners of equal ability? In particular, which approach works best if you're learning in a less immersive environment (for example, not studying in your target language country). I've attempted to find research into this online but to no avail.

On face value both approaches have benefits and drawbacks - the former you have more one to one time with a tutor and a more bespoke learning environment, however a lack of peer learners to share study or motivation with as well as an approach that's typically far more expensive.

The latter is more commonplace and a more traditionally ""academic"" learning path where you're likely receive a more generalist teaching, and are splitting time with your tutor between other students. However, you also have peers at a similar level of ability to study and practice with, share resources, methods etc. 

Curious what peoples thoughts are or if there is any research out there people are aware of. Or if anyone has done one or the other and which they've preferred.",1626882882,katilakoski,8

It’s literally 50% flirting and 50% “hi’s and i’m-doing-great’s followed by 👻👻”. The app is also literally built like a dating app, with shirtless dudes everywhere. Plus it doesn’t help that the inconsistency of replies make it almost impossible to have an actual conversation. Some will be instant, and then followed by a reply &gt;1 hour or even a day later. (It might just be a pet peeve of mine, but i don’t like sudden ghosting when we are literally in the middle of a conversation)

I can honestly tell when someone is trying to improve (which i really do appreciate), when they give more than one worded answers and actually try to engage. But in apps like these, i don’t get people want to get out of it when they don’t put in any effort at all. 

This is an example of an interaction i had: it started with the basic small talk before we decided to start practicing our languages. He starts off with a very
butchered introduction of a VERY BASIC PHRASE in chinese (“ni hao wo okay” is what he said). To which i wrote 2-3ish paragraphs correcting him. He says, “ohh okay” and the next thing i know, HE’S NOWHERE TO BE SEEN. Huh???? 20 minutes of fucking small talk for that?? Even from his perspective, what did HE get out of the conversation??

On the bright side, i have started to cherish the friendship i have with my spanish exchange partner, who i was too lucky to meet, even more. As for now, i’ll delete the app and stick to consuming german media, while skipping the talking for now...

My background in language learning is kind of a diversified one, if I can say so myself.  
I have a C1 Advanced in English, I can positively say I am more confortable with English than Italian itself, everything I do and ""consume"" is around 1/10 in my native language.  
A good Spanish level from my school days that I kept reading/listening through the years (a bit rough on vocabulary, due to the inactivity on the speaking side, but fine understanding it).   
A bit of Japanese's basics I studied when I was at University before quitting studies (mostly sillabaries and elementary grammar).  
Same goes for French, which I tried as a self-thought experience some years ago, but quickly stopped the process due to more urgent things.

Now, putting aside my still standing interest in Japanese (language and culture as well) but not avoiding a serious comeback, I am dubious about what to choose between :   
\- Going back to Spanish and dive deeper than my past school days, and always fun;   
\- Give French another shot, I love the musicality of it;   
\- The new entry would be German, which I understand is a challenging one but maybe easier than Japanese considering it is more on the Latin side, therefore my curiosity.

However, I’m interested in knowing what some onomatopoeias in other languages are. If you have any favorite onomatopoeias in languages other than English or just know of any onomatopoeias at all in another language, I’d appreciate if you reply to this post with your onomatopoeia(s), the language the onomatopoeia(s) is/are from, and what it/they mean in English. I think it’ll be fun to not only learn some onomatopoeias in other languages, but to also possibly learn which languages have a lot of onomatopoeias, which languages have the most fun-sounding onomatopoeias, etc.",1626798518,Spudblood,2

I understand Buddhism has many denominations and is worshipped in many different countries with lots of interpretations and teachers. There are also the ""dead"" languages which are used in ceremony and reading the source materials, I believe.

What I want to know is which language is the best to dive deep in to achieve the best knowledge of Buddhism for me? I'm suggesting that, if I was to travel to the Eastern Hemisphere for a Study Abroad, what language would allow me to communicate with a skilled teacher, or perhaps better understand hidden context?

languagelearning,For those who are highly proficient in a second (or more) language-- are you able to think in your second language/does it happen naturally?,"TLDR: the title basically, could I ever be capable of not filtering my second language through my native language as an adult language learner who can't move to another country/be fully immersed in the second language.

I'm interested both in learning languages and the study of language itself for many reasons, but one is that I've heard that people who learn to speak another language feel as though their personality is different in a second or third language. Something about the language itself changes the way they communicate, due to its structure, vocabulary, etc. I'm not a linguist or a neuroscientist or anything like that, but it makes a lot of sense to me. 

I'm interested in exploring this aspect of language, and in learning how different languages may change my self expression. however, like most second language learners, my second language is first run through a mental translator into my native language. It is subconscious and uncontrollable. 

Do you ever get to a point where you aren't doing that? where even your thoughts naturally come to you in another language? I have a really strong internal monologue and I sometimes wonder if it sort of hinders my second language development, because even the way I THINK is totally dictated by the laws of the language I speak. I'd love to someday find that I've been thinking in my second language, without having to TRY to think in my second language. I'd love to someday not mentally translate between the two, to not hold them both in my head at the same time when trying to read, listen, write, speak, and most importantly, think!",1626789612,waking_dream96,50

languagelearning,Language Learning Pro Tip For Naturally Reviewing Rare Words: Read Poetry,"Poetry is underrated nowadays as a language learning media source, and I have always thought of it as one of my secret weapons:

* SHORT: most poems are **short**. If your attention span is limited, they're a great way to get manageable daily reading in from a native source, even as a beginner
* MEMORABLE: poems are designed to be memorable. Remember: songs are--if done right--poems set to music. And we know how catchy song lyrics are
* VOCABULARY: the underrated tip for intermediate/advanced learners. Two stanzas of even a mediocre poem will often naturally review 3-5 words that it might take you (without exaggeration) 3 to 5 *entire books* to encounter once
* THAT STILL REPEATS: And if you read a collection of poetry? Poets, despite having huge vocabularies, still have their ""favorite words."" So you will often find 2-3 extremely rare words repeated across 5-6 poems, providing valuable, native sentences to mine that would otherwise be difficult to find

And sometimes the words are repeated within the same poem! A recent example: ""Raúl"" by Francisco Contreras, a wonderful Chilean poet. I read this stanza:

Los soberbios suntuosísimos palacios (The sumptuous palaces, regental)  
De portadas blasonadas y triunfales (With portals emblazoned and triumphant)  
Se perfilan en los fúlgidos espacios (Outlined in fulgent spaces)  
Coronados de diamantes siderales (Coronated by diamonds, sideral) 

And thought, ""Wow, you don't run across 'blasonado,' 'fúlgido,' or 'sideral' everyday."" Except that if you keep reading for 19 stanzas, you encounter this:

Una hermosa virgencita pudibunda (A beautiful, pure virgin)  
De cloróticas pupilas siderales (Of chlorotic, sideral pupils)  
Que reflejan del azur la luz profunda (That reflect the azure's profound light)  
O el metálico fulgor de los puñales (Or the metallic fulgor of a dagger)

""Siderales"" and ""fulgor"" (the noun for ""fúlgido""), just in time to be reviewed and remembered. (And three stanzas after that you read this line: ""La que tiene por blasón un lis de plata,"" repeating the noun form of ""blasonado."")

I can't speak much about Spanish, since I've never learned it, altough I've seen it mentioned as the easiest language several times. Same for English. The grammar is not particularly difficult. The spelling is hard because you have to learn how to pronounce each word. There are a lot of sounds which can't be found in my native language. Eg I can't differentiate v and w from each other. Word order still causes me problems sometimes. The vocabulary is very big. And there are 12 tenses, altough only a few of them are used in everyday life. But they can be confusing, like past tense vs present perfect. As I noticed learning the basics is relatively easy, but reaching an advanced level is much harder. I can understand most English texts, but if I have to write by myself I make tons of mistakes. (When I was writing this post, I accidentally spelled ""they"" as ""day"".

languagelearning,Learning words with Anki. Just want some opinion.,"&amp;#x200B;

I have been recently thinking of how best to encode information in Anki. I want to ask for me, who is studying Japanese, and my friend, who is studying English.  We're both advanced.

Words- There are simple words(nouns and simple actions etc) and there  are complex words. I'm thinking of continuing with recognition cards, but also including a sentence with context: my own story that I have built after reading the definition and a few examples, or an example from a native media.  In both cases I'll try to understand how the word fits the situation. If there are other definitions of the word, Ill make other notes. For production, I want to use Close cards with media more often. One problem that I have faced is that I didn't properly 'encode' the word. I tried to encode a rough meaning. Remembering entire sentences will take too much time. And remembering definitions is painful, and often even the best dictionary definitions don't capture the context the words are used in.

I read articles by some people suggesting making cards with a few words(somewhat known words + new words). But it will increase review time, and can increase failure rate and redundancy. Actually, I tried it earlier this year but couldn't succeed. Maybe because I was trying to remember entire sentences in a manner which was not n+1. Instead, I feel that it would just be fine to create separate cards when required.",1626767686,workr19,1

So I like **Polish** because it’s a bit like Russian but softer and sounds like French in a way.So it sounds nice because it’s a mixture of both since to me Russian sounds harsh to me at times.

I like **French** because it sounds fancy and mysterious.The reason I got inspired to want to learn this language was because I heard a video game character speak it and sounded cool so that made me want to learn French.


**Ukrainian** is cool but I’m learning it because it sounds softer than Russian and if I was to ever go to Russia I would like this language because it’s not harsh and sounds unique compared to how I hear other languages.

languagelearning,Anki helped a lot in the beginning stages but I realize why it's not as effective for me later on.,"When I first started studying Japanese and Korean, I put every single vocabulary word to SRS like Memrise and Anki. I was progressing at lightning speed because I'm able to retain words significantly better than without SRS and it ensured that I don't forget vocabulary.

When I started getting to intermediate and advanced levels, my retention rate isn't as good, a lot of cards ended up being leeches due to the number of times I mess them up, and eventually the review piles up so much. I knew a lot of vocabulary but the problem is I couldn't pull them out when I need to.

Now I realize why it's not working as effectively for me. In the beginning stages, the words I put into SRS are basic and very common words. I encounter and use them often enough. Like the vocabulary words for common food, common adjectives, verbs, etc. The Anki reviews help enforce these vocabulary. But when I get to much higher levels, the vocabulary is not something I'd encounter as often and when I look at my stats, I realize that I encounter these words much more times in Anki than in actual material I read or listen to. It's easier to drill basic level words into SRS because you're more likely to retain basic information and vocabulary you're more likely to use than obscure one off words. No matter how much I try to optimize the Anki algorithm, the brain would just put on low priority words that aren't very important. The Japanese word for portable shrine they use in festivals is not something I'd need to know or not something I'd think about every day. It's much harder for higher level words and the only real way to absorb them is to encounter them many times in different contexts and that's not something that can simply be forced on you. You might be able to force some words in your brain with enough drilling but there's a clear limit.",1626764446,InsomniaEmperor,9

languagelearning,"It's OK, depending on the way you use Anki, to spend a considerable amount of time not only reviewing your cards, but also creating them.","A few days ago I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/olqsjg/you_are_probably_spending_too_much_time_doing/) and I immediately started comparing the way I use Anki with the usage there recommended (which I thought was reasonable, just different from my own). So I thought about writing this up to let people know that there are other ways to use the program, which may not be as ""efficient"" when compared to the more popular approaches, but can be just as fun, if not more. Beyond fun, I think it can be more constructive for language learning in general.

In my experience, the notion of making your language learning more ""efficient"" (and this efficiency is almost always related to speed, not necessarily quality) is commonplace in the sentence mining oriented language learning circles, and its desirability is most of the time taken for granted. The thing is, I don't really know if I agree with that notion all that much. Surely many people must be in a hurry to learn, because they've got places to go and people to talk to. But I don't think I'd be mistaken if I supposed that most of us do not fit into that category. 

Why should we make things more efficient, and not more interesting? From my point of view, the ""efficiency"" approach to language learning is detrimental to the activity itself. That's why I think that language learning should lean more to the side of a ""patient"" activity, rather than an efficient one. I think that being patient is more rewarding in the long run than being efficient. Sure, you can ""become fluent"" faster with the latter, but I've been thinking, inspired by [this other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/on2d2f/i_have_no_desire_to_ever_be_fluent_i_just_want_to/), is fluency really what we desire most when we start learning languages?

So, what does Anki have to do with all of this? It's really simple: I propose a ""patient"" approach to Anki. Don't worry about making your card creation more efficient. Don't worry about creating decks with tens of thousands of words, sentences or whatever. Don't worry about adding to your deck 20 words, sentences, or whatever a day from your ""immersion"" — a word I think is used in a kind of loose way. I mean, what even is ""immersion""? Seems to me to be just a romanticized way to say ""doing whatever it is that you normally do in your TL"". Don't worry about meeting a set number of cards in a set amount of time. **Don't worry about spending ""too much time"" in your reviews**. I know this bold phrase seems contradictory. Let me explain.

If you take the ""patient"" approach to Anki, you won't worry about creating the **absolute best** **and most efficient** Anki cards, you will just make whatever seems reasonable to you. You won't worry about creating ""easy to review"" cards, you will put on the back side of your cards whatever information you feel like will make you understand the meaning of that word better, even other words, contextualized words, words you still don't know, but that will make sense in that context; words like antonyms, synonyms, heterosemantic words or whatever (and this applies to both beginners and advanced learners the same, I do this with cards written only in my TL). You won't worry about adding 10, 20, 30 cards a day to your deck. You will add whatever number of cards you feel like. I add 2, 3 cards a day. Sometimes I don't make new cards at all. But when I do, I spend 10 minutes making a single card. And when I review those cards, I spend whatever amount of time I feel like reading them, because it's just **fun** to be reviewing them. Reviewing the tips and notes I wrote on that card. Seeing similar words, different words. Words I don't remember and look up when I don't. It's fun to read the sentences I put on the back of those cards. Anki, and language learning in general, doesn't have to be something of which you trim off the bad parts, because depending on the way you face it, there are no bad parts. 

There is this notion going on around language learning circles that Anki is boring and that ""immersion"" is what really defines the learning process, and that therefore, you should minimize the amount of time you spend with this ""fake language environment"", this ""crutch"" that Anki is, and maximize the amount of time you spend with the ""real language"". I don't think there is such a thing. Language is everything. There doesn't exist a single thing in this world that doesn't go through language. If you think of it like this, I'm sure Anki won't be a drag. For that matter, nothing will. Just take your time. Do whatever you feel like. Do it slowly if you want to. I create cards that take me a minute to read fully. So what? It's not a problem. Languages are complex. Why should learning them be any different? Why should it be fast, efficient, straightforward, ""optimized""? Too many cards to review in a day? If that happens even when you create just a few cards a week, oh well, better do it when you feel more like it. Go do something else. Is reviewing Anki your religion or something?

People will say ""Oh, but I *have* to learn 10,000 words before I can start enjoying my TL"". Oh, you *have to*? I'm sorry to hear that, really wouldn't want to be in your shoes.",1626740976,chungkng,1

If I do an Hour a day of each language, sometimes two, could I get a decent amount of skill in polish? Even if Polish is just a sort of hobby language I would be sad to let it go for a bit. Anyways, I would like to hear someone's thoughts on this  and maybe help me out. Thanks.",1626738575,chepi422,14
languagelearning,Here's how many words and how much time you need (probably)," Hello all,  


I posted something quite like this many years ago on the old HTAL forum, and since then I've revised my ideas and wanted to share it with you all. There seems to be many people, myself included, who want some kind of measurable idea about how many words and how much time is likely needed to reach a specified level (according to [the CEFR scale](https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168045bb52)) in a language. Well, here's my attempt to answer that question. Keep in mind, I've only studied Indo-European languages and so can only assume that this scale applies to that family and more distant languages from these likely require significantly more time. Also very important, the ""how many months"" question assumes effective, dedicated studying for a *minimum* of 2 hours per day, every single day for the given time frame. Obviously, failing to meet that target will result in slower progress. The word count also assumes higher frequency words, eg. knowing 500 words about botany isn't going to meet A1 criteria. Alright without further ado, here's my two cents.  


Words known per level:  


A1 - 500  
A2 - 1000  
B1 - 2000  
B2 - 4000  
C1 - 8000  
C2 - 16000  


Time needed per level:  


A1 - 1 month  
A2 - 2 months  
B1 - 4 months  
B2 - 8 months  
C1 - 16 months  
C2 - 32 months  


As you can see, each level for both categories doubles the previous total. I don't have a scientific basis for this at all so it's based purely on my own experience and the experiences I've heard from other learners. Nonetheless, hopefully it gives the obsessive among us something to aim for.",1626738529,GandwolfTheGrey,13

First of all, I will concretely say that Discord indeed has language learning community servers. Some target on all languages, in one server, while other are whole servers for a single langue.

I have benefited so much from the fact that, if you're in the good servers, Discord is truly a form of free live 24 hours help line for any language. All servers have a section for help where most of the time, you will be answered by native speakers in an instant. 

Don't get me started on how useful the voice chats are. Speaking the language, it is done so much easier by Discord. Really, I could spend all day on the voice chats just practicing and using my non native languages. 

Please download and use language learning Discord servers. It will make your life better",1626737727,John_Denver1,23

languagelearning,For those who have taken upon themselves to learn Persian-what is the most difficult part for you?,"For me it's partly reading,mostly speaking Vs writing knowledge
So,since my first Lingua is Bulgarian, reading the perso- Arabic script can be nothing short of a clustefuck at times. Say what you think,but imo Persian should adapt to a modified version of the Avestan alphabet for one little thing which flips the table-they write their fucking vowels. Plus,I hate these odd letter‌s like اً. Right when I think I can read a smth no sweat of these mosquitoes pops into existence to spin my eyes 180. Not to mention the Arabic loan letters. Like why in the ever living fuck are we keeping them? They only do two things. First,they confuse newcomers (ط is pronounced identically as ت,for example). Second,they only appear in Arabic loanwords-a fact which doesn't seem to be widely taught,since I had to rummage through the Internet to find out.  

As a person of Afghan heritage,I have decided to learn Dari. Problem is that some words are spoken and written like the difference between a Macedonian and a Bulgarian. For example: (I) don't want: spoken namehoiom,written namehwoham. I am still a beginner,but I have seen such bullshit here and there,so I am expecting more to come at me as I progress.",1626736448,gogogozoroaster,8

languagelearning,Should I study abroad with my school in Canada for 3.5 months or take a year language course?,"

Im unsure which is the best decision for me and here’s why. My plan was to study abroad, I have been saving up for over half a year I have just over 6000USD so far, and will be departing in march next year. I know I still need twice that much, but I still have money left in my tuition so that isn’t a problem as well when I go i will be selling my car (+$3000). As well i will be working full time for 3 months before that. 

I really only want to go so I can learn japanese and live in japan. But i do need to finish my degree, or at least still get one. If i were to go to a language school it would be next April so around the same time.  And from what im learning the price isnt that much more. If i do go to a language school, what i would want to do is continue my post secondary education at a japanese university having a major in japanese. If i were to say pick going to a language school what schools are best for their price as well cheaper living areas. What do you think is the most possible and beast outcome for me?

Unfortunately with the pandemic that hasn’t worked out. I now want to get myself to a conversational level ASAP, so I’m looking at taking a course.

My question is, would it be better to take a full time, 5 day a week course, or to take a part time course (maybe 2-3 evening or half days).

My gut tells me that the 5 day course would be best. But I’m wondering how much I’d actually pick up given the intensity/bombardment of information.

languagelearning,How people self studied languages in the 50s/60s. (Korean language vinyl record),"So, I saw this on eBay and thought it was interesting. I imported it from Australia. 

Actually, I was pretty impressed with it. It has very practical phrases related to travel, and a pretty decent dictionary. The romanization is terrible - but honestly, no worse than the modern way Korean words are romanized. 

It's interesting where they show Korean writing. It's primarily Chinese characters. So, I imagine in 1964 many Koreans were still illiterate in Hangul. Some words are not used as much anymore. I assume they are based on Chinese. So, it's not exactly up to date, but most expressions should still be understood by Koreans. As someone who has studied Korean for 3 years, I understood most of it without any issues. 

The speaker's voice is very clear on the record. Only Korean words/phrases are spoken. So, you would need to have the booklet handy to study. Everything is only spoken once, so you would need to be moving the tone arm back and forth constantly on each section if you were truly trying to memorize everything. 

Interestingly, the label on the record is backwards. Side 1 and 2 are reversed. Only record I have that I have ever noticed that on...

Anyways, I thought this was a cool piece of language learning history and wanted to share. 

I also ordered the Vietnamese edition. I'm worried the booklet won't be included with it, which will make it pretty useless to me. I also bought several ""Learn a Language"" courses that were sold in a lot super cheap. They are on 4 records each.

Now I have around 15+ years to give(this simply is an esitmate, what I mean is, i've all the time in the world and I dont need any of those ""fluent in 6 months"" shit), so around 5 years per language. I know once I learn one of them others will be easier, that's the case with Jap and Korean grammar, for example.
I'll be acquiring the languages using Matt vs Japan's Refold method. It's gonna take me 5-6 years for the first, I'm pretty sure.
Now from here, i've some questions. I've read some posts about it and i've seen that people think chinese for jap and kor is like latin for the romance languages, is it so?
I mean jap and kor have a very complex grammar compared to chinese, then jap and kor have very easier pronunciation than chinese(i've kept in mind the jap pitch accent, still easier than those fkn tones.)

languagelearning,"For years I held off on learning Spanish because I felt I could never do it the ""best"" way. I have finally figured it out. The best way to learn a language is the way that works for you and that you will stick with doing. Doing anything is better than doing nothing.","Like many people, I took a language in highschool (french) but never really got into it. After highschool I moved out of my small town and realized how common Spanish really is and wanted to learn. I googled ""what's the best way to learn Spanish"" and instantly was thrown into the discussion and research people on this sub constantly fight over. There was no solid conclusion, but some things I remember were ""immersion and speaking with natives"" which wasn't possible for me, ""buy this $300 software, classes, private tours, subscriptions to apps"" again, no I'm poor af, ""practice for hours every day"" I'm a college student I don't have that time right now. I found Duolingo, a free app that lets you practice a few minuets every day. Then I googled it and of course everyone says it's terrible. So, after hours and hours of searching I just concluded it wasn't possible and gave up.

COVID happened and I decided to pick up a hobby and picked Spanish. This time I said I'll try the ""best"" method that's also free. On the advice of people in this sub I downloaded Anki and started with the 1000 most common words, I started trying to read a book in Spanish, and tried watching a show with Spanish subtitles and realized ""holy fuck I hate doing this"". I didn't feel like I was really learning and the constantly pulling up worlds in the dictionary was giving me a headache. Again, I gave up. 

Now this summer I said ""fuck it"" and decided to just do what I want and give it one last shot. I got Duolingo and made a goal of getting one bubble to gold every day. I've stuck with it for two months, not perfectly, but close. I can stumble through basic sentences and know nearly 1000 words. Finally I am actually learning Spanish. Is it the ""best"" and fastest way out there? Probably not. Do I know 990 more words than I used to? Um, fuck yeah I do. I'm really proud of how far I have come, even if it isn't as fast as others, this is the way that works for me. Now that I feel I have a bit more of a basic structure I'm looking at getting a textbook to start getting a more solid explanation of grammar and such. Is that the ""best"" way to go? Probably not, but it's what I want to do. I feel like it's the next step for me.

What happened to learning a language because it's fun? What happened to enjoying education instead of just drilling thousands of flashcards into your head? What happened to ""everyone learns differently""? Not everyone wants to torture themselves sprinting to the finish as fast as they can. 

I think when I graduate I'll start putting a lot more time and effort into learning, but for now I'm just doing what I can and I'm happy with the progress. Whether or not it's the best way, at least I'm learning.",1626663898,peterjmonday,22

For those of you who go to a language school or are in general preparing for a language test, how do you go about practicing your writing skills?
While writing my weekly essay I was low-key feeling guilty about checking my grammar and looking up words that I wanted to use.

On one hand, I think there is some value in searching new words and catching your own mistakes, on the other hand, I feel like I doing myself a disservice by not forcing myself to make the best out of my current vocabulary and by not submitting my unedited work to my instructor, so that they would correct me.

languagelearning,"I have no desire to ever be “fluent”.

There’s countless languages out there, and I’d rather have basic (able to read script, introduce myself, etc) in multiple than be fluent in just one. 

I think the language learning community as a whole removes a lot of the freedom and fun from language learning. For some people, native fluency is their goal (which is great!) but language learning is not one size fits all.

While not complete grammar books by any means, they do provide an excellent overview and starting point before one goes on to learning the learning the language using other means. If nothing else, the books remove linguistic blindspots that might hinder learning.

**Monday** It seems that with words like chico(boys) and chica(girls) the one ending in o is used for groups of mixed gender. I usually dislike it when languages have male and
female variants of words like actor/actress but Spanish does something with them that I find interesting: novio means boyfriend and novia means girlfriend
but because novio is used for mixed groups, novios can be used to mean something like lovers, not just boyfriends. Today I noticed that padre and madre (father and mother)
can be used in a similar way, so that padres can mean parents. I'm not sure if there is an actual word for parents or not.

**Saturday** When I was learning Japanese I remember thinking how weird it was that they substituted v in foreign words with a b sound, because to me they sounded nothing alike, now
however I'm actually misshearing one for the other quite often, especially in words like debes. I'm also beginning to think that there are no different pronouns for 
second person plural and third person plural, they are both just ustedes, though I'm not sure about this.",1626612595,faceShareAlt,40

Your thoughts?","I signed up for an intensive online program to learn my target language a while back (3 months ago). I still have 7 months left of the program. It entails 1 hour a day of a lesson plus homework, every day of the week.

Since my teacher is overseas, there is a time difference.

I'm really tired of being scheduled for random hours. 

Every single day my one hour lesson time changes due to my teacher's schedule with other students. 

I've done 5 a.m., 6 a.m., 7 a.m., 8 a.m. ,9 a.m., 10 a.m., 11 a.m., 12 p.m., 1 p.m., 2 p.m. and I have even been asked to do 10 or 11 p.m. 

Rarely will I have a lesson at the same time the next day. It is always randomly scattered within the hours I've mentioned above.

I cannot even have a job with such hours.

I have already expressed this to my teacher twice before but at the end of it all, nothing came out of it.

I'm getting to the point where I am just upset and tired of not having a set schedule or at least a less scattered schedule.

Is it bad if I just let the academy know that I no longer want to study. The lessons themselves were decent but it is turning what was supposed to be fun and challenging into a big scheduling issue that has drained me for 90 days.

languagelearning,Feeling a little daunted about getting back into japanese (spoke for 10+ years) because all my friends are still fluent. Tips for getting back into it and regaining fluency?,"I started learning Japanese in kindergarten, and am now 17. I went to an immersion program that went from having half my classes in Japanese during elementary school to a quarter of my classes in Japanese in middle school, and then one class in Japanese in high school. I dropped out of the program when I was 16, which I deeply regret, but I was also suicidal and I wasn't really learning anything at the time. 

Anyway, most of my friends are still in the program, and a few of them also speak Japanese at home (parents who immigrated from Japan). It feels sort of stupid to get back into it (even though it's been like, 20 months, which isn't too long...) because I don't know that I'll regain my fluency since I don't have anyone to consistently speak Japanese with. 

I'm not sure where to start with learning Japanese. My school has their language classes somewhat weirdly formatted, so it's japanese 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, and then intermediate Japanese history and culture and then advanced Japanese history and culture (which I what I took as a freshman and sophomore). I'm thinking about trying to get into the 7-8 class or the intermediate class this year, but since forecasting is already done, I'm not sure how likely that is. 

If I'm not able to do that, what would y'all recommend for resources? I've never had to structure my own education of Japanese so I don't have all the resources. The main things I think I'll struggle with is re-learning grammar stuff, and being able to read kanji.

I had a few rules. 
- It wasn’t supposed to feel like work, so I wrote just before going to bed since I used to write a (“normal”) diary at that time a while back. That way it felt like picking up an old habit, but with a twist. 
- I didn’t want cram in information, again, not work, just fun. Therefore if I felt tired I wrote just as much as I wanted and stopped when I didn’t want anymore. 
- I was allowed to use a dictionary as much as I wanted (even for entire sentences) 

My progress:
In the beginning the majority of the pages was just me writing down words from my translation app. As the days went on I realized that I knew most of the words, I just had to figure out how to put them together. In the end I wrote around half a page without a dictionary and made immense progress! I’m feel so happy and proud over this!! 
I wrote 16 (A5) pages by hand in 7 days (while studying on other aspects as well during the day) after studying my TL for about a year!

I am learning Preposizioni's, adjectives, adverbs, and learning about reflexive verbs. I am also beginning to study passato prossimo. 

 I have a LOT to learn but I am able to understand much more than I expected in writing, or when being spoken to.  The greatest challenge is speaking on the fly without using a chart to be grammatically correct.

 I recently started an Intermediate Italian class to continue to level up my study and skills. 

  Also - follow me to the bookstore as I get an E-reader to read my grammar books on the fly.  I am going the minimalist route. Instead of an IPad full of apps and distractions, the E-reader is a simple way to study on the go.

languagelearning,You are probably spending too much time doing your Anki reps. Here are some recommended settings and my personal techniques for beginner Anki users.,"People spend way too much time doing their Anki reps. My main deck is a frequency deck. I learn 20 new cards a day from it, and it takes me an average of 15 minutes to do ~225 reps (~4 sec/card). It does not take an hour to do Anki. It should not even take half an hour for a beginner. Here's how!

#Grade Cards Quickly

Obviously you grade a card quickly if you know it. But what if you don't know the card?

If I don't know the word after a few seconds, I fail the card. Sure I could spend 15 sec and maybe get the right meaning, but when I see or hear the word while immersing, I won't have 15 sec to remember it. In that time, lines of dialogue will have gone by, and I will either have to rewind the content or try and catch-up. I try and pass/fail a card as quickly as possible - I give myself a brief pause to see if it comes to mind, and if not, I fail it.

It is not a big deal to fail a card. It's actually a good thing - you're telling the system you don't know it very well, and you are telling yourself that you don't know it well. It gives you more practice with the card.

""But won't that increase the time spent doing your Anki reps?"" Good question. The answer is NO. If it takes me 4 seconds to grade a card, if I fail that card 5 times in a session, that's 20 sec. If you were instead to go the slow route and spend 10 sec on that card, you would likely fail it both times, and it would still take 20 sec.

I don't know about you, but back in school when I made paper flashcards, I would drill the crap out of them. Sometimes it took 10 tries to get a card down. I'd rather that process be faster than slower.

#Recommended Settings

I highly recommend using the settings found on this [page](https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-1/c/srs-best-practices). It takes maybe 10 minutes to set-up correctly, and will pay dividends down the line.

The only deviation from those settings I personally use is that I removed leech cards from existing in my deck (set leech threshold to 0). At first I used the leech function as described in the link, but I still felt I needed to learn these words, and unsuspending cards is annoying. So I just completely turned leeching off. This means that no matter how many times I fail a card, it never gets suspended and temporarily removed from the deck.

So far I've had no issues - sometimes what would be a leech card will be stuck in the beginning learn phase for a week or two, but eventually my brain latches on and starts to remember it well and graduates. It is not a big deal to me to fail a card all the time - I accept that every word is remembered at different speeds, some I immediately remember, and some I don't. And because it only costs me 4 seconds a rep, failing a card repeatedly is not a big deal to me. My goal is to learn these words, not boost my ego by having a larger section of Mature cards in my Anki deck.

#Don't Get Greedy

I'll repeat what's in the link - the basic math is that your (daily new cards)x(7)=(Expected daily reviews in 2 weeks)

New Anki users get impatient at first, and learn 100 words on day 1, then 100 on day 2, and then realize too late that they now have 220 reviews due on day 3, and for most of the following week as well.

Be patient. Start slow. Increase by increments of 5 cards every two weeks as desired.

I currently do 20 new cards a day. That's 1800 cards every three months. That's a ridiculous amount. If you were to just halve what I currently do, you would still be learning ~1000 words in three months. And that would take just 7.5 minutes a day at my pace.

#Why keep your Anki time so short?

Because Anki in the language learning process is like eating your vegetables as a child. Some kids really like them, but many don't like it. The smaller amount of time you can make your daily Anki, the more likely you are to do it.

If your daily Anki reps take only 10 min, it's incredibly easy to never miss a day. We can all spare 10 min a day, even on days you feel extremely lazy. You might not be up for watching Target Language TV shows, reading a book, watching a YouTube video, reading a textbook, or any number of things because those all take time. When your Anki time can be done during the commercials of one 30 min TV show, you'll find time to do it.

The less time you spend doing Anki, the more time you have for everything else in your language learning, like the ones I listed in the previous paragraph. And I think everyone wants to spend more time doing those things.

#Okay smart guy, what's your experience doing Anki this way?

I've studied 26/30 days recently. I currently have 1074 (12.76%) mature cards, 581 (6.9%) Young+Learn, 89 (0.19%) suspended (cards that are too easy), and 6660 (79.1%) unseen. I've been using Anki fairly regularly for the past 4 months.

* Learning cards are 71% correct (5697/7944 reps)

* Young cards are 77% correct (6551/8464 reps)

* Mature cards are 81% correct (844/1063 reps)

The rates for learning and young cards are less important than mature cards . Most people recommend that as long as your mature cards are at least 80%, then keep pushing on.

As I said at the top, on average it takes me 15 minutes to do 225 reps, for a rate of ~4 sec/card. I'd say that's slightly slower than it could be (sometimes I'll get distracted and leave my phone unlocked on the Anki app while I go do something and then come back).

I'd invite you to compare your stats to my own, and I hope this helps some of you!",1626471962,lazydictionary,50

Can anyone recommend a  simple, book, to get me going here? Preferably an ebook or large print book, since I'm getting old? Or actually anything else that might get me past this ? I really want my Italian back and it's the only language I'm having trouble with.

languagelearning,What to do when an iTalki teacher goes MIA,"Hello friends,

I was wondering if you could give me some advice about what to do in my situation. I’ve been working on and off with a particular teacher in my TL from iTalki since January. I really enjoyed working with her and had hoped to continue. So much so that I bought I package of lessons with her. Well, the last two lessons we had scheduled she canceled very last minute claiming not to be feeling well. And then earlier this week, two other lessons I had scheduled with her were canceled by iTalki, and it looks like it’s no longer possible to schedule lessons with her. Under other circumstances, I might write this off as a bit of a bummer but part of how these things go. However, I currently have a partially used lesson package with this particular teacher and I’m trying decide what my next course of action should be. If she comes back to iTalki, I’d like to actually use those lessons, but if she’s not coming back, I’d like a refund for the lessons I can’t use. I already messaged her over iTalki to ask what was up, but haven’t heard back. I guess my question is: how long should I wait for a response before asking for a refund? As I said, I really liked her and want to give her the benefit of the doubt, I just don’t know what the right thing to do is.

Thanks for the advice.",1626461659,HaphazarMe,11

languagelearning,I need your help. I can't properly communicate in my native language anymore.,"Hi, I think I'm facing a bit of a unique issue right now. I have been debating for the last several months about whether I should write this post or not but here we go. In short, I have lost the ability to properly communicate in my own first language and, frankly, I don't know what to do to get it back.

I was born and grew up in Belgium speaking and learning French at school (and Dutch, but that's not relevant) and with friends and Italian with my parents (both immigrated in Belgium in they late 20s) so I have always been a perfect bilingual, although some words usually came easier in one language or the other. I only started studying English when I was about 13 and I just couldn't manage to do it, at school and struggled for several years. One day, however, everything kind of clicked and I have been learning English by myself ever since to the point of reaching a certified C2 level a few years ago.

From 2019 to 2020, I moved to the Netherlands and almost exclusively spoke English with everyone except my partner, who only speaks French, with whom I had a long-distance relationship for the duration of my stay. This is when things started going downhill.

I gradually started to lose my ability to properly communicate in French using subtleties, clever play on words and so on to the point where what I say often leads to arguments, due to miscommunication. I even go as far as stuttering and blanking out for several seconds, desperately trying to find a specific word or a synonym. Generally, I end up panicking and completely losing my train of thought, therefore angering my partner. When I was younger, I used to simply speak in both French and Italian at the same time with my parents because they speak both but in this case I just can't use the same technique. I used to be as good with words as my partner but now it feels she's dating someone who can barely communicate.

I gradually dialled back several aspects of my life in French but the ease with which I used to communicate still hasn't come back, more than a year after I came back. I suspect that part of the problem is the way in which sentences are built in English, which seems to be much more intuitive to me.

I feel like I've started shutting myself down in this relationship because of my inability to properly communicate and frankly I need your help so please, if you have any suggestions, please, don't hold them back.",1626453267,BelgianWaffle97,6

languagelearning,Do you ever think when learning grammar that it seems like somebody just came up with all that shit?,"I am officially opening a conspiracy club (as the blinded will call it) for all those doubting the historians and being intellectually superior to everyone else cause we are seeing the patterns learning other languages. 

The world is managed by languages. The ones that control the world have spoiled our mind. Once the whole world spoke one language, now unknown to the comman person. This is at present only spoken by those in power. (e.g: Bill Gates, Wladimir Putin, Xi Jinping etc.) 
They and their ancestors have rid our mind of our mother tongue and infested us with these inferior languages made for simpletons. 
They control the world in secret sending messages in this original language. Let‘s wake up and take back what was once ours. It is our birth right to speak this tongue!

This is all based on facts. Example:
In Italian for the past absolute you have 1st conjugation (infinitve ending: -are) 3rd person plural ending: arono, then 2nd conjugation (-ere): erono and 3rd conjugation (-ire): irono.

For more examples and an explanation in order to gain a fuller picture of its capabilities I suggest [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8psgEDhT1MM&amp;vl=en) or going to the [official site’s examples](https://beta.openai.com/examples).

---

Some notes on AI and personal limitations:
- GPT-3 can ‘speak’ a number of languages, but its capabilities are roughly related to the popularity of the language. English is excellent, along with Spanish and French to a lesser extent, but there are grammar and syntax trip-ups beyond that. I’m thinking of mainly using the English and Spanish models with DeepL + human oversight for other languages to have maximum quality.
- I am happy making command-line (terminal) tools, browser extensions, and websites, but will be unlikely to dive straight to developing a mobile app due to cost and unfamiliarity.
- Being one person, the monetary investment I can make into developing this is very limited - while I have the time to train my own model, code the entire UI myself, etc. I simply don’t have the resources now to sink thousands of dollars into expensive fine-tuning of GPT-3, paying for human translation, etc.",1626401661,LAcuber,8

I'm looking for suggestions for a good learning platform for Danish that is laid out similar to Say Something In.

What I mean by that, is SSI gives you a series of sentences in each lesson, pausing after each word, phrase, &amp; sentence for you to repeat, then mixes them up as you continue through the lesson to keep you on your toes. The following lesson is very carefully &amp; consciously built on the previous ones, using a lot of the same vocabulary/grammar but in new, complex sentences and mixed with new vocab.

I hope I'm explaining it well enough. To be fair I've only tried SSI Welsh, but it's genuinely been one of the most enjoyable &amp; effective (for me) methods I've ever tried.

I found this to be true with the letter ‘A’ also, where sometimes it will have a nasal sound but there will be no accent to indicate that. For example, the letter ‘A’ in ‘amo’ has a nasal sound but the first ‘A’ in ‘amanhã’ does not have a nasal sound yet the one that follows does have one, but I’m not sure how I’m supposed to determine these differences if I was to come across a word I had never seen/heard and I was to just read it and ensure I pronounced it properly solely with my knowledge of phonetics.

languagelearning,How to Properly Use Anki?,"I bought Anki for the iPad a while back and have been trying to use it for language learning. I also have it on my desktop to be able to sync community decks. However, the community decks have not been very useful to me because the words seem irrelevant and kind of random and I feel like I would learn more from actually creating the deck myself. After trying to create decks for about 4 days now and deleting all of them, I have found that I'm not actually sure of the most helpful way to use Anki for language learning. I have read multiple guides and reddit posts but none of them have helped too much.

I know that phrases are better to learn because then you learn words in context, but how do I come up with phrases in my TL, which is German, if  I am just starting out and I know nothing.  Also, I have saw that a lot of people like to include audio on their cards. I do not know any native German speakers very well so how do I add audio? I could record them myself but I feel like that's a poor idea because I want to get as close to a real German accent as possible. I also could pronouce a word wrong which could be hard to unlearn in the future.

If I do use Anki for vocab words would you recommend that I create a separate deck for the words and phrases? Also, are frequency lists a good place to get words from? I have seen may mixed opinions about frequency lists. I am trying to use as many free resources as possible and do not want to have to have to buy books as I am a university student and already spend enough on books as it is.",1626349446,MysticUser11,37

languagelearning,Strategy for reading :)," Hi,

I've come up with a fantastic strategy for reading native-speaker content :) I'd like to share it with you.

**What to read**

 Read anything you want, but only pick one or two paragraphs to read. I use Klexikon for German ([https://klexikon.zum.de](https://klexikon.zum.de/)) (I've read the article on Mozart and the Duden), and Harry Potter for Spanish. This method works for both online material and paper books!

**Length of time**

Depending on your reading speed, this takes about half an hour to complete.

**Strategy**

1. Read the text out loud. This helps to practice speaking.
2. Read the text in your head. This helps to practice reading comprehension.
3. Highlight any new words and look them up in a dictionary. Write down the words you don't know and their definitions in a table.
4. Read the text in your head once more, this time focusing on unfamiliar words.
5. Translate the text into English. You should have already written down unfamiliar words, so this step helps to recognise grammar structures.

**I hope this helps :) Let me know in this post how you get on.**

languagelearning,Is French or German easier to speedrun?,"I’m a philosophy student going into my third year of four, and I suddenly recalled as I woke up this morning from anxious dreams that I rather want to do a master’s. I live in the UK, and it would cost bank to do it here, so I’m planning on doing it abroad. The options, it seems to me, are either somewhere in France  or somewhere in Germany. 

Now I don’t speak either of those languages fluently, but you need at least a C1 for most courses. I probably have a B1 or so in my German as it’s very much atrophied, although I can still understand it pretty well - I can watch TV shows in it if the subtitles are in German as well, and I sometimes listen to lectures in it and understand most of what is said. On the other hand, I’ve probably actually studied French itself for four days total in my life, but because my main foreign language is Spanish, I can read it no problem and understand it in its more formal spoken varieties. I can probably speak enough to get by right now, but obviously I have to study the grammar in depth and idioms and such like.

Now, I’ll probably need to apply late next year, which means I have a year to get to C1 in either one of them. My question is - which one should it be? I would say that, besides some second hand Francophobia from my Spanish friends, I generally prefer French as a language, and obviously there is the food to consider. On the other hand, my German is probably better as it stands, it’s easier to pronounce obviously, and it’s arguably more important as a philosophical language. Regardless, the important thing it to learn it, and fast, so any tips in that respect would also be much appreciated.

languagelearning,Learning a non-Indo-European language,"I’m a 28 year old native English speaker. I’ve been learning Spanish off and on over the past several years, but started studying more often recently and have made lots of progress. I took an online test a few days ago and got the result B2, though for now I think I fit B1 better. I’m having a much easier time with listening comprehension and recalling words more quickly. It’s nice to find something that I’m enthusiastic about that comes sort of easily to me.

I want to learn a language outside of the Indo-European family at some point. I’m considering Turkish because I like the way it sounds, and there are so many other languages that are partially mutually intelligible with Turkish. But, I would also consider learning another language instead...like maybe Swahili or Indonesian, something that wouldn’t be insanely challenging. It would be cool to learn a language where the vocabulary is mostly unfamiliar to me.

I guess I’m wondering what the learning curve is like for a language outside of your native language family. Does it make any easier to learn a language as an adult if you’ve learned a second language, even if the third is outside of that family? Also, how proficient should I be in Spanish before I start learning Turkish, or whatever else I choose? I don’t want the Spanish I’ve been learning to get shunted to the side by a new different language.

For now I’m occasionally taking the basic Duolingo lessons in Turkish and Swahili (and German, even though it’s Indo-European). My thought is that this way, when I do start focusing more on a new language, I might at least have a few words and phrases that I’m familiar with. 

Just wondering if anyone has thoughts to add about this! Thanks.",1626317224,brachiocephalopod,4

languagelearning,Help!! Looking for participants in a study about language-learning in online gaming communities.,"TLDR: MMORPGs and gamer culture offers a LOT of potential for the world of linguistics, education, sociology, and academia in general- help me show how gaming is a unique and worthy time investment by participating in my study!

Hello everyone! My name is Lizzy Naughton, and I am a linguistics student at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, and I'm looking for participants for my study about international gaming culture.

The study will be about how people learn new languages and skills because of their investment into MMO/MMORPG culture. Virtual reality, role play scenarios, immersive storylines, and interaction within the game and outside of the game all all factors that make the MMORPG community ideal for learning complex skills, particularly communicative language skills. My study will aim to be an **ethnographic investigation** into online gamer culture, specifically for those who are gamers who are non-native English speakers playing in a primarily English-speaking environment.

My background is of someone who loves studying linguistics, and who also loves observing how online culture and what gaming culture is changing younger generations.

All I will need is to conduct some personal interviews within the span of 4-5 months, and permission to observe your chat interactions in communicative platforms such as discord, reddit, etc. (This platform will depend on the participant.) The interviews will last no longer than an hour, and I will only need up to three interviews. **All names/ personal information will be kept anonymous.**

I am specifically looking for participants who are 19-years-old and older, who play an MMORPG regularly, and who do not speak English as a native language. English proficiencies do not have to meet a certain standard, but you have to interact in-game or online in *mostly* English.

The study will begin within August. The end goal is to have a **collection of opinions and experiences from non-native English speakers about their experiences as gamers**. What do you like about the community? How do you feel about your English? **We also want to have linguistic observations about how players communicate and chat in discussion-based forums,** looking for signs of code-switching, use of multiple kinds of English dialects, etc.

Please, help me out and reach out!! This will be an interesting and worthwhile experience. The study will help future researchers to understand the nature of MMORPGs and the MMORPG community in the context of globalization, internet culture, and youth culture.

I’ve been learning German for just under a year now. I’ve been studying in a very lazy manner, and as a result my skills are quite lopsided. I’ve pretty much exclusively drilled vocabulary and listened to native content with a bit of reading and basic grammar rules sprinkled in. As a result, while my listening is actually very good at this point, my speaking and writing are comparatively very poor.

Anyway, I want to start studying French, maybe in a more deliberate, well-rounded manner, since I have numerous French speakers in my life. However, I don’t want to drop German completely, because I like the language and have put hundreds of hours into it, so it would be a shame to put all that to waste.

I’m finding myself recalling German words whenever I drill French vocab or try to say something in French.

languagelearning,Has anyone ever made a word frequency research of the most named objects (of modern society)?,"From vehicles, to housing, to technology appliances, to tools, to furniture and so on, has there been a word frequency research for human-made objects? Usually, most of these words rank badly in language-wide frequency lists because even though they are objects and creations that we see and use everyday, they're also specific words that can't compete in usage with nouns like ""house"", ""technology"", ""tool"" and so on.

Only the truly obvious usually make it to the lists (TV, cellphone, laptop, car, etc.). It would help a lot if you could point me out to a frequency word list of modern objects, or at least to a modern and recent frequency word list of the English language that ranks about 20K words, since most of the words I'm looking for should be found within that range, and I could then create the list myself by grabbing the words I want.

languagelearning,What do you prefer for learning a language? IPA or a custom phonetic alphabet?,"I am working in a material for teaching a language where I constantly need to show the pronunciations since the orthography of the language is a bit complex.

That's why it was created a custom phonetic alphabet *(let's call it ""CPA"")* instead of using IPA whose letters are complicated to type in the middle of a discussion in a forum. 

Word | IPA | CPA
:--|:--|:--
swehdos | ['sweː.dos] | {swE:dos}
spreu | [spʀø] | {sprö}
witerom | [witə'ʀom] | {witërOm}
kheiss | [xeɪ̯s] | {qeys}
shinan | [çi'nan] | {xinAn}

*By the way, it was not me who created CPA.*

Another advantage of CPA is that one of its letters might mean two or more sounds, for example:

{o} = [o], [ɔ]
{r} = [ʀ], [ɾ], [ʁ]

So, a word like ""witerom"" admits the following pronunciations: [witə'ʀom], [witə'ʀɔm], [witə'ɾom], [witə'ɾɔm], ...

*But if I were meant to use IPA, I think I could notify people that, for example, [o] may also mean [ɔ]. It's not a big deal, I suppose.*

But time passed, I created tools to phonetically transcribe words to IPA and CPA *(a script that does the job in a web page)*, and the grammars have tons of phonetic transcriptions in CPA. So, I don't think that realistically there will be a need to type phonetic transcriptions in the middle of a discussion since people will already have easy access to the transcriptions.

**So I've started to think whether would be a good idea to drop CPA, and only use IPA. What do you guys think? This is the question of this thread.**

IPA seems to be intimidating with those strange letters and diacritics, but it is an official phonetic alphabet.

The problem is that all materials use CPA, so it would be a huge work to convert everything from CPA to IPA. So, if you guys think that it does not matter which phonetic alphabet is used *(i.e., you don't care)*, then I will stay with CPA, otherwise I will use only what do you think is the best (IPA or CPA).",1626273571,hmslima,12
languagelearning,Phoebe pronunciation?,"So, I'm not a native English speaker, but I write a bit from time to time and I was wondering- Is there an old or just rare way to pronounce Phoebe that isn't, well, ""Fi-bi"" (or however you'd actually write the pronunciation for it)

languagelearning,I just noticed something about the English alphabet...,"When learning how to pronounce new words. Some non-English speakers will try to 'spell out' or sound out' a letter, before trying to pronounce the entire word. It can be less daunting for some people. So I tried it myself. Below I listed each letter of the English alphabet and how I pronounce each letter myself. 

Example (based on Australian English and our somewhat unique pronunciations) 

A: Ay

B: Bee

C: Cee

D: Dee

E: Ee

F: Eff

G: Gee

H: Ach or Hach 

I: I / Eye

J: Jay

K: Kay

L: Ell

M: Em

N: En

O: Oh

P: Pee

Q: Qu

R: Are

S: Ess

T: Tee

U: Yu

V: Vee

W: **???DUBBLE YOU???** Where is the W? 

X: Ex

Y: Wy

: Zee or Zed

The reason I dislike this feature is because when I see a Russian sentence or some words that I understand, I understand because I am thinking in Russian. Unless I am translating for someone, I’ll never need to go from Russian into English for anything beyond a word or two. This type of exercise is extremely tiring because, while I understand exactly what the sentence is expressing in Russian, the English words don’t come naturally even if I know the meaning of the sentence. Of course, sometimes I will not recognize the context of a word, and will need to translate it to English, but I only ever need a single word or phrase. 

I don’t mind it the other way around (English into TL) because if I’m writing a lot or speaking a lot, my brain will obviously be thinking in my native language. I simply despise having to rewire my thought patterns of thinking in Russian just to progress in Duolingo.

Grammar is a bit shaky at times, but I can usually hear what's correct. I can't speak about anything complicated (since I only spoke Russian with my mother about everyday stuff). However, I have a good understanding of Russian when it comes to listening (the news, etc), but I struggle with speaking.

Taking all these factors into consideration, how do I practice my Russian? Any recommend websites, apps, things I should do? Thanks a lot in advance!",1626190082,Naltzy,6
languagelearning,Questions about languages in your country...," I'm Brazilian, and I was thinking about how important is for us to learn new languages, we are surrounded by countries that have Spanish as their first language, and even though Portuguese is quite similar to Spanish, people don't speak Spanish at all, and English that it's not so close to Portuguese, the situation is even worse!

I was looking in my youtube recommendations and I saw that most Americans learn Spanish or French when they try to learn a foreign language. So...

languagelearning,Should I Switch Teachers/Tutors or am I just Giving Up Too Easily?,"For context, my target language is Tagalog. I am a Filipino born in Canada and I have mediocre to decent skills in understanding/listening because I live in a household with Filipino parents and grandparents who speak mostly Tagalog/Taglish. Although, all my other skills like speaking, writing, etc, are terrible. The thing is, it's just really weird to tell what my actual skill level is. For example, I could know some advanced words but forget or not know words that are so simple. Or sometimes, I can understand a sentence that's being said and I can tell if it sounds grammatically correct or not but I don't understand the reason/logic of how and why it's correct, I just know that it sounds right/natural because that's what I'm used to hearing. Also, just understand almost everything being said to me but not having a damn clue of how to even begin creating a sentence to reply with lmao. My overall goal is to just be able to reach conversational fluency; be able to talk to friends and family with ease in casual day-to-day conversations, and visit the Philippines and be able to communicate with native speakers.

So, with the hopes to improve my Tagalog skills and become conversationally fluent in the language, I ended up scheduling a trial lesson with a tagalog community tutor. She's a nice person and I sort of explained to her my situation and let her assess my skill level and everything was relaxing small talk at first. The teacher then proceeded to jump to teaching me things like pronouns, objective pronouns, formal and casual style sentence/rules, affixes, and adverbs. Throughout this, I was understanding a decent amount of the words she was writing down and saying to me but all the rules, prefixes, suffixes, etc felt like it was too much. The trial lesson ends and even though I felt slightly overwhelmed I decided to brush it off because if I don't struggle then I won't learn and it's only been one lesson.

After the trial lesson, I schedule another lesson and the same thing happens. More rules and new concepts to learn leading to me once again feeling overwhelmed. Towards the end of the 2nd lesson, I talk to her about my level and ask if she thinks I'm good enough to learn all this, and she starts telling me that I'm more advanced and I'm not really a beginner due to my decent understanding and my fast adaptation to pronunciation. But I don't feel that way at all lol, I feel like my understanding of the language and my being accustomed to the sound of native people speaking every day has made me look more advanced than I really am.

The thing is, I actually really like the teacher. She speaks English and Tagalog well, goes beyond the time to further explain more concepts and examples, is always open to questions, and is overall nice. I just feel like I'm too dumb to be her student lol. I also don't want to feel guilty for no longer taking lessons with her since it seems like we're going to continue doing lessons, especially since she always brings up what we will learn about in the next lesson.

I just don't know if I'm giving up too easily, maybe it's my lack of confidence, or am I just not that good and I should switch to a more beginner curriculum style of learning.

Should I switch tutors? Try to talk to her more about my situation (if so how should I go about it?) Or just stop using tutors all in all for now and focus on other things first?

Sorry if this seems like a rant or is a stupid question to ask, I'm new to the language learning world and am just really excited to learn Tagalog, but I'm starting to lack confidence right away which is making me question my own capabilities, especially with not being able to consistently determine my actual skill level and where to go from there.",1626186317,TheGreatScrubini,7

I'd like to introduce Inkah which I've been using for quite some time while studying Chinese.

You can use it to watch Netflix shows which allows you to view Korean and English subtitles at the same time, provides a list of words for each subtitle line, and auto-pauses when hovering subs. Or if you’re learning Chinese, you can also choose to view Chinese, pinyin, and English subtitles at the same time. They have their own in-built dictionary to provide better word parsing. This extension tool never fails to keep my studies interesting everyday!

So far, I'm very pleased with the features offered by Inkah. They've been always releasing updates to improve it! I believe this will be extremely useful for Chinese and Korean language learners out there!

languagelearning,Native English Speakers and Language “Parasites”,"Hi, I am American and at a good C1 in Mandarin.

""Remember that most of these sounds are formed forward in the mouth in French, and deeper in the throat in English. When you form French consonants forward in the mouth (think “l” formed on the tip of the tongue as opposed to American “l” formed in the throat) the vowels that are attached to the consonants will form forward in the mouth as well, which is what you’re looking for. Form all of the sounds forward, you won’t need to change your mouth shape as you pronounce, and the vowels will remain pure.""

Can anyone elaborate on the reply? How do you produce sounds forward in the mouth? 

Is there an online course that can teach you how to produce certain sounds in your mouth? 

Theoretically, I understand what he means when he says ""you won’t need to change your mouth shape as you pronounce, and the vowels will remain pure."", but practical application is not easy.

So I recently finished and audio lecture from the great courses (language families of the world, by John McWhorter) where I learned about diglossia. One of the things that struck me about it was how many speakers in diglossic cultures/ areas often don’t consider their vernacular language a “real” language. 

I volunteer as an ESL tutor, and as fate would have it in my most recent batch of students, I have a guy from Morocco! I met up with him outside of class recently, and he indeed says he doesn’t really think of the Moroccan Arabic (also know as Darija?) as a real language. 

I would love to hear from people from other diglossic areas around the world and see how they think about their vernacular speech/ language. How common is it not think what you speak is a “real” language? Is it just because it doesn’t have a native writing script? Is it more strictly a cultural phenomenon? And if someone’s target language is a part of a diglossic culture, do you just have to try to learn two languages?

I started studying Chinese a year and a half ago mainly because a buddy from high school speaks it, and I wanted to learn a new language. I can't say I was super into Chinese at first, but over tie, I grew to love the people and culture of China, but now I am starting not enjoy it at ALL. I can't bring myself

to study hardly at all anymore. I changed my lessons to bi-weekly instead of weekly. Heck, for a while I was doing two a week,

but that got to cost too much. I am not sure if I need a break and maybe move to another language for a little bit

because I don't want to stop language learning but the problem is I feel guilty so my friend for ""wasting"" his time, and I almost feel like I wasted mine if I change paths at this point.

Japanese: I love anime and japenese culture, its all interesting to me. But what my fear in taking this is  the letters, atleast in spanish I can read the words while not understanding it, but in japanese I have to learn a whole new alphabet.

I felt like i just wasted all my time writing notes and learning those things back then cause when I got back to learning Korean, i felt frustrated cause I forgot almost all the things I've learned. So I recently tried learning Spanish and I felt accomplished in learning it and it motivated me to study more. I've been addicted in studying Spanish now but I'm not really sure if I should go on because deep down I still want to continue learning Korean because most of my days are spent watching K-dramas and listening to Korean songs so I'm not really sure if I should go on with Spanish.

I've been studying Korean for a while now, and I'm about to go into college here in America. I've been thinking about possibilities for a job while I'm on campus (I don't qualify for FAFSA's work-study, so I have to get creative) and I had an idea about becoming a translator for some sort of online digital service. I began researching this type of work and was wondering if anyone here had any wisdom on the topic! I'm personally considering it because I believe it could be flexible with a class schedule, give me the opportunity to use my skills, and possibly even help get my foot in the door with being able to go abroad or work with language later, all while looking good on a future job resumé.

Any input on if this is a good idea or not? Anyone done anything like this? Would this be a good job experience for a student, especially one who is hoping to work/study abroad later? Or is this a dumb idea altogether that I should scrap?

(In case it’s pertinent: I’m an overall B2. Mirroring my English skills, my reading &amp; writing are definitely miles ahead of my speaking &amp; listening, which is why I think digital translation would be a good fit; text is my strong suit. I'd probably begin seriously looking for a job like this around winter break, so I'd have time to improve a bit too and get used to a college schedule. I really enjoy translating, and translate articles in my own time for practice, and also had an old blog where I translated online comics!)

###Spanish:

I took 3 years of Spanish in Middle school but haven’t studied in *5 years* .I did try to learn through 3 years ago through Duolingo app but it wasn’t the same as learning through the classroom so I became demotivated.I learned on my own because my moms side of her family was half Spanish/half English because I wanted to sound not dumb but lost my motivation a bit for it but at the same time it’s just useful since it’s used a lot.

I know there is feminine, *(Tú,El,Ella,Usted,Nosotros,Yo)*,informal/formal.But I can only speak basic phrases back and understand some of what people are saying in Spanish if it is basic words I heard a lot.

###French:

I never studied this or tried learning this learning, but recently I’ve been trying to find a better hobby than gaming since being on the game negatively affects me.The reason I wanted to learn this language is because it sounds nice and just wanted to learn something new.But I have no experience in it at all.But it seems pretty cool and don’t know y’all’s opinions about it.

##*What should I learn?Spanish or French*

languagelearning,"A language to widen my horizons, especially for the Asian continent","I am Brazilian, so **Portuguese** is my mother tongue. I can use **English**, and I am already studying**Spanish**.

English opened a lot of ""cultural doors"" for me, thanks to the language of Shakespeare, now I can access a lot of culture and also high-quality technical materials, not only from anglophone countries, but also from countries of all over the world through the translations of their materials to English. *I am learning Spanish because practically all the countries that surround Brazil speak this language, not to mention that Spanish has a relatively huge relevance in the world*.

I would like to learn one more language, but this one must widen my horizons as English did to me. For example, there are a lot of materials in German, but I suppose that most of them *(I mean the ""relevant"" ones)* are already translated to English, *you can correct me if I am wrong*. I love mangas and animes, but most of them are already translated to English or even Portuguese, that's why I don't think in learning Japanese. All languages have something not translated to English that is worth of knowing, but I cannot learn all of them, so I would like to choose one that would ""unlock"" the biggest amount of culture as possible **that is not available in English, especially from Asian cultures**. What kind of culture? Art in general and technical materials.

Another example to you understand what I want: Mandarin carries a millenary and rich culture from just one country, but does this language would ""unlock"" the other Asian cultures for me that are not available in English? I wanna know more about **East Asia** ***( China, Japan, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea, and Taiwan)***, **South Asia** ***(Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, etc)***, **Central Asia** ***(essentially the -stan countries)*** and **Eastern Europe**; there are a lot of materials about and from these countries that are already translated to English, what other language would **widen even more my access to these cultures**?

-------------------------------------

**I already have some languages in mind, here are my thoughts and I would like to see yours:**

* **Russian:** I think that this one would ""unlock"" the Eastern Europe and good part of Asia, it's what I feel, I have no basis for this affirmation

* **Arabic:** the Arabic world is totally alien to me, what make this choice interesting, but the fragmentation of the Arabic language takes me away from this option. *And I am more interested in the other parts of Asia...*

* **Mandarin**

Does this mean that you shouldn't learn Mandarin? I'd say no. First, the gap in power between Mandarin and the next two languages (French and Spanish) is still pretty large. If China implodes, it's still got a ways to go before dropping down a notch.

More importantly, if China does start to lose ground economically, it could do desparate things to maintain their position. And being able to talk to them might be useful in keeping yourself out of the cross fire.

languagelearning,Learning a language through immersion is slow if it's all you do,"All over Reddit there are people telling you that if you study grammar, phonetics, or anything else you are wasting effort and you should just learn it by consuming native content or shadowing. 

I have ADHD and I did horribly in school. I understand why people are afraid of studying and want to avoid reading about grammar. However, I believe this is based on fear and irrational thinking but some people seem to have convinced themselves it's objectively superior.

Here's an example of why it's not time efficient. I've been taking the Pimsleur Japanese courses, which are audio based, and they keep trying to teach me how to negate verbs by making me repeat the words over and over again in simulated conversations. The vocabulary is just not sticking in my head this way. I'm continuing to use the program because I could use the help with listening comprehension and pronunciation, but other aspects of it could use improvement.

However, yesterday, I found out about [Godan verb conjugation](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/verb-conjugation-groups/) through [this](https://youtu.be/UHo3qUb79No) video. Now, negation seems more simple. For certain verbs you just add an i (い) to it which makes my life a lot easier.

Ultimately, it doesn't matter how you choose to study because everyone will get to the same place eventually. If you reach fluency nobody will care if it took 2 years or 20 years. If your method of studying works for you I'm not saying you should stop. I just don't think there's enough pushback against the immersion school of thinking so I wanted to say this.

""Immersion"" is supposed to mean using the language with native speakers and learning that way. This is definitely a good thing. However, I feel like on the internet with some people, ""immersion"" means then if you talk about studying that language you're elitist and snobby and wasting your time, which is wrong.",1626028059,tesseracts,81

languagelearning,How does stress accent work in English?,"I am a native English speaker, but upon studying other languages that have stress accents (in specific Latin), I realized that I neither understand the concept of a stress accent nor am conscious of it when I speak. I merely regurgitate the pronunciation that I heard as a child and the mere act of regurgitation produces the stress accent. This is also true to a lesser degree in Spanish (as I was partially raised by my Spanish speaking grandparents) as I do not think about this in Spanish either and despite my limited Spanish vocabulary, I seem to get it right anyway without understanding what I am doing. I read that video is different between English and Spanish, and I certainly pronounce it differently in English and Spanish. However, when I was younger, I would just think “it is said this way in one and another way in the other” and years later as an adult, that is still the only explanation for what I am doing differently.

It occurs to me that if I am to learn other languages that have a stress accent, it would be a good idea to learn what the English stress accent is so that I could adapt it to the needs of other stress accent languages. With that in mind, would someone please, either explain or point me in the right direction for how to understand, the English stress accent?",1626026863,ryao,9

For a year already I've been living in the Netherlands. Before coming here I'd put a lot of energy into learning Dutch and I've reached a level where I'm actually conversational, I only have difficulties understanding natives who speak fast or with an accent.

I'm waiting for a situation where it'd be useful.

Everyone prefers talking to me in English simply because, well, *everyone* speaks fluent English. No, even Urk isn't an exception here. There have been zero situations where my knowledge of Dutch was any help, as everything important is bilingual. Even people who know that I speak Dutch prefer talking to me in English simply because it's more convenient for them.

Of course, ever since the invention of script media became the second, but not less important carrier of culture. The problem is, since everyone in NL speaks English:

1. Foreign content for adults isn't translated into Dutch.

2. Whoever has any success, starts making content in English. There are lots of Dutch international hits, none of them are in Dutch.

languagelearning,using anki again? yay or nay?,"Here's the thing folks. the first time I used Anki was when I was just starting to learn Polish at a1 level. I fell out of it though I'd say after 2 months of using it because I felt like I wasn't gaining anything from it. I even created my own cards, added example sentences, reasonably studied (I never tried to tire myself out) but eventually, Anki seemed pointless to me and a waste of my time.

I have a great study routine now and I feel completely fine without Anki. When I encounter new words I write them down with example sentences and then review them the next day. However, because I am b1/2, I encounter so many new words every day and this can get overwhelming.

So then I thought myself: what if I start Anki again to assist me with all these new words? maybe Anki will be useful this time since I'm at a higher level and actually know what I'm doing?

Yall think I should try using Anki again or just keep immersing myself and reviewing words I wrote down? Does anyone have the same dilemma? or have yall had a great experience with Anki at b1/2?",1626024529,randijacksonyuh,10

###What I did
Watched children's shows I'm familiar with and read simple manga.

###Journal entries

**Tuesday**
Today I was watching One piece as usual with it's subtitles that don't always match exactly but are ok 9 times out of 10. 
Or so they were until now. On episode 67-ish the subtitles suddenly changed and it's now unusable for me, so I guess I won't be using subtitles 
for the foreseeable future. The good news is that while searching for a better site for reading manga, I opened one of them from the most popular list to
see how the site worked, and to my surprise I could actually follow it for the most part. It's called Ijiranaide Nagatoro-san and it's some pathetic fetish thing
that's remarkably easy to follow, perhaps even more so than Yotsuba, and I'm actually enjoying it for some reason, I think I'll read it.

**Wednesday**
My listening is still not as good as my reading but I think that the gap is at a more normal level, so I won't worry about it too much, but still, 
with the loss of One Piece I started putting more care into what I listen to and I found this show aimed at very young children that's called Ben and Holly.
It's not exactly entertaining, but I can actually follow along somewhat so it's still better than watching something where I don't understand the story.

**Friday**
My motivation changes from day to day like I'm on a roller coaster. One day I feel like I'm doing great, understanding a lot of things, but on others it feels like 
the content I'm consuming gets more complicated at a certain point, except that when I look back at the parts I read the day before they also feel the same.
It also doesn't help that I have no idea if I'm doing well or not.

**Saturday**
It feels so good when I finally notice what sets two similar words apart. For the most part I don't remember the words exactly, only as jumble of letters or sounds,
and I usually dont know what sets apart words that sound similar or refer to similar things for example I just figured out that viaje means something like journey and vieja
refers to an old woman. Another set that has been bothering me for a while are the c-nouns for head related things. I think I got it more or less down: cara is face cabezo is head,
cabello means hair. I'm not sure about the last one because there is a very similar c??b??ll?? word that probably means horse. This is even worse with verbs that are a lot more
fuzzy because of the conjugation. But I suppose not knowing the words exactly but being able to recognise them in context is a lot better than being able to write them down in a vocab quiz
but not being able to recognize them.

It's also worth noting that I guess the meanings of new words a lot less often than before. Also I think I've reached the limit of what I can figure out about the grammar and phonetics consciously,
so I've stopped making guesses about those all together. Here is what I figured out so far: The writing is pretty much completely phonetic, the few sounds that I have problems with are
ll and y which may or may not be the same sound, and I think I tend to hear two sounds for y one voiced and the other not, this might just be allophonic. One of the few things that I knew about 
Spanish before this experiment is that it distinguishes between rolled and unrolled r-s which would explain the difference between r and rr, but I speak languages with rolled and unrolled r-s so I think I would be
able to hear the difference between the two but I can't which leads me to doubt my memory. I'm also not sure if the h is silent or not most of the time or if it's just a very soft version of j. 
The vowels are a lot simpler, I'm pretty sure that there are only 5: a i u e and o, but I've seen an ü written down but it only seem to appear in vergüenza and I think it's pronounced as an u there.
Furthermore I'm sure that there are no long vowels and double consonants, even when two instances of the same sound appear at the boundaries of the words they seem to be realized as just one of that sound.
I also know that the ' thingy marks the accent, but unaccented words have this very particular Spanish-y sound that I have no idea what it is, but I'm certain I could replicate it.

About the grammar, I know that nouns have at least two classes el and la, if there are others they must be very rare. It seems to be mostly random which word belongs to which class, but words that end with an o tend to be el
and words that end with a or ion tend to be la. The plurals end in an s. Adjectives can come either before or after the noun they modify and conjugate to match it's gender and plurality. The verbs work very similar to English with the 
added conjugations for the subject and the object. The latter can also be expressed by putting the me/te... before the verb. There are contionuos and perfect tenses and passive voice, probably expressed by ending the verb in do
and putting a conjugated form of estás, he and soy respectively. I absolutely could not make a table for the actual inflections but I think I can more or less recognize them.
It even has helper verbs like tengo and debes which work kind of like have and must/should. 
Relative clauses are right-branching and seem to start with que.

languagelearning,Is it offensive to often speak your relearned native language to yourself/use it as your base language? Is it offensive to use a language for more than conversation? Disagreement with another language learner.,"I have been relearning my native language (Russian) and begin learning Estonian soon (I'm from north east Estonia), but have run into a moral/ethical delimia. I was brought to Canada young to live with a strictly English speaking family, so English is by far my strongest language, especially from how badly I forgot my Russian over the years (relearning now). 


My friend, who is from Canada, is upset with me for often speaking Russian to myself/making it a larger part of my life. To me it is important, because my first years and memories were back home, and the language holds a lot of significance for me. While I understand that I am Canadian, it is very important that I regain this part of myself. 


His view is that as Canadians, it is offensive to make a language  beyond English/French part of who you are unless you have grown up to adulthood in the country of the languages origin. He says it is fine to learn a language, but you should not talk to yourself in this language or tell others you speak it unless they also speak the language. He says it is offensive and minimizes the experiences of people that grew up to an adult age in their home country, and that I am appropriating a culture I haven't belonged to since childhood. For reference, his family has been here three generations, and he has relearned his families origin language, but never speaks it unless with someone else that does. His view is that anything beyond this is deeply offensive. He says I am embarrassing myself.


I'm wondering, how do others feel about this? I will not stop trying to relearn my native language, but maybe it is a good idea if I draw back on expressing myself in this language (a lot of my ticks are still in my first language). It is an interesting conversation, because I suppose I can understand his view? He is deeply educated, very much more so then me, so maybe he has a special insight?

languagelearning,"A tip for the ""GLI"" sound in Italian","If I hear another ""AG-Lio"" I'm going to have a stroke.

A hack for anglophones attempting to pronounce any Italian word with ""gl"" in it: forget about the G.

Examples: aglio (garlic), artiglieria (artillery), tagliatelle. Alio, artilieria, taliatelle all sound a lot closer to the real pronounciation than tying your tongue in knots trying to pronounce the ""gl"" sounds.

If you want to put a little more effort into it you can treat the G as a second L and put a little stress on the L sound. 

ALLio, artiLLieria, taLLiatelle are pretty close to the real sound and someone that isn't listening closely might not be able to tell the difference.",1626001939,AncientSaladGod,2
languagelearning,Thoughts on the Days of French 'n' Swedish YouTube Video on Anki,"Days of French 'n' Swedish is one of my favourite language learning Youtubers - mainly because he is realistic and offers sensible tips to average learners.

In his latest video, he notes the problem language learners have with Anki and other Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) is that the size of Anki decks quickly increase to the point they are unmanageable and destroys the learner's motivation.

I agree with this, but it seems there is an underlying assumption that at the end of studying an Anki deck the learner will understand all the contents perfectly. This has always been my main problem with SRS systems:

1. If I use a pre-created Anki deck, I sometimes find I will misunderstand the context of a word. An example is the word ""customs"" - as this may refer to either ""customs and traditions"" or ""customs duties"" (taxes paid on entry of items into a country). Of course, this led to an amusing / confusing situation when talking about this.
2. If I see a word I don't know and add it to my own Anki deck, I have no understanding of whether this word is frequently used. As an example I would point out the words ""dog"" and ""pooch"" in English - if English were my target language and I encountered the word ""pooch"" before ""dog"" I might say something like ""Do you have a pooch?"" - this sounds a bit strange.
3. It's easy to misunderstand the cultural context of a word. So if a word is rude or a swear word, I might not fully understand not to say it in a work environment or with children.

languagelearning,Trilled r,"Every time I try doing an alveolar trill I just end up somehow doing a one-lip trill on either lip? (or a dental fricative) I don't even understand how that works, I don't even touch the lips or anything it just happens. I try relaxing the tip of my tongue and I try cupping the tongue, either my body's just averse to relaxing the tip of the tongue when I need it to or it's just not working. I try doing an alveolar tap and blowing a lot of air at the same time. I try repositioning my tongue to any position that could be useful. I try making a little space in between my tongue and the articulation point. I've been trying for so long now and I just can't seem to get it. I was born in Sweden speaking Swedish and even by the age of 10 I never got it, I just got by using [ɾ] or [ɽ] or /ʀ/ (I lived in southern Sweden and heard the guttural sounds used sometimes, although it was more trills). I went to my school's speech therapy for it when I was in around 1st grade but it went no where. 

For a long time now I've lived in the U.S. and I'm trying to learn Spanish which is even more important to trill in unless you live in certain countries, and even more I'm heavily interested in linguistics now so I want to have [r] and [r̝] in the list of sounds I can make, for one because they sound fucking amazing and for two because coronal trills are the most common rhotic. I've been trying so hard for a long time and I can't get them. It's so annoying and frustrating and doing things like this for so long and getting jack from it is tiring and infuriating to me. I've read every method and tip there is and I've practiced so much.

I see people saying they've finally done it after years, I can't practice that one thing for hours for years and stay sane, I'm much too impatient to wait 2 years to get it or whatever. That won't make me be able to do it any faster, I just think that's insane and too much to ask of one grown person. I feel embarrassed with how much I've failed at this, especially since so many people that never make it or hear it in their life can just start making it on a whim (like to simulate machine gun sounds or engines or something), and I'm stuck here knowing anything linguistic about it and practicing so much yet I'm not even close.

I can't afford to go on for hours every day either because of all the time that's wasting on just trying to make a sound, I'm shit at multitasking so I have to focus on it and stop whatever else I'm doing. I'll do it for a while and get tired then do it in the shower. What doesn't help is I don't just want to be making stupid noises when my parents are home, so I have to do it when they're not, which severely fucks me over whenever I'm in the mood to try it.

languagelearning,Slowly (app) is amazing for finding language penpals,"So the entire concept of Slowly is that it tries to mimic sending letters, you can send a letter to anyone in the world and based on their location relative to you it takes different times to arrive. 

I’ve been using it to practice Spanish and it’s been amazing, I’ve been taking a dive into Uruguayan culture and being able to specifically search and send letters to Uruguayans to learn more and share my excitement has been fantastic. It’s so exciting seeing “new letter arriving in 23 hours”. It’s been really funny because some people are like “I’ll be honest, after seeing a letter come from the United States I didn’t expect it to be in Spanish”. 

You’re able to set your level of the language so others know and so if you’re more of a learner you can also actively seek out people who are bilingual in English and they can help you out more. I don’t journal or anything in Spanish so this has been great practice, just being able to punch out multiple 500 word letters a night to people across the world. 

There’s definitely some weird people on the app but it mitigates most of the weirdness of anonymous platforms in that it’s mostly text based, both parties have to agree before anyone sends pictures and I haven’t really had anyone try so it’s been a wholly positive experience for me, I recommend people try it out.",1625977278,Inspir0,32

So I need to be B2 by the end of next year, to be able to take the DELF test.. roughly 1 year 4.5 months to go. I’m unsure what my current level is, i think i have finished A1 for reading/listening but production is difficult, can write simple stuff though. I can mostly follow the first few episodes of Inner French podcast with about 60% comprehension, for example, but can’t speak much.

I have been doing:
1. Aim to finish Harry Potter’s 2nd book this month. I went through the first chapter so far, and marked the vocabulary or grammar structures i didn’t understand. Will review unknown vocab at the end of every chapter, so far i only understand 50% of it but it’s super fun so far. Did a lot of shadowing with a few graded readers before this.
2. 1 italki lesson per week, in-between i work on the assignments my teacher gives me. Next week i’m supposed to speak about an article i read. 
3. I spend about 30ish minutes everyday transcribing short easy videos for active listening practice.
4. Write small journals in French, last month i did this everyday but this month i’ve only done it once.
5. Not following any grammar course, so far i learned whatever grammar via context. Should i focus on this? Last year I burned out doing grammar so haven’t touched it once. 

Not sure what else should i be doing. Is it possible to read extensively to increase vocabulary instead of anki flashcards, if i’m on a tight timeline?

languagelearning,Any advice please for an ‘intermediate’ learner - explanation in comments,"Hi guys, I’m new to this sub as I myself in a rather strange part of my french learning journey.

I’ve been learning now for just over a year now - using initially just text books (‘practice makes perfect’ books have been the best for me) and am now at a point where I’m transitioning more to reading magazines (which I was impressed at my ability to do so easily) and watching french TV with french subtitles etc, as well as keeping a journal. My girlfriend is french and we speak daily in french too

My weird feeling, which is what I’m asking about here, is that whilst I’m transitioning away from text books, I really benefit from the structure they can give so want to keep them as part of my daily french learning at least a little bit so I don’t forget important grammar etc, and yet it is becoming harder and harder to find textbooks that are in my sort of capability - they all seem to either be for absolute beginners, ‘intermediate’ (which tend to end up being too easy) or advanced which I feel like stretches me a bit too hard.

languagelearning,Should listening be comprehensible?,"I’ve asked a similar question before, but I still don’t know how to feel about this topic. I worry about my listening bc you hear about these people who spend hours listening to their TL, even as a beginner &amp; they recommend it (so incomprehensible input is good bc you are still listening to your TL). On the other hand, I see people who say listening should be comprehensible and if it isn’t, it’s a waste of time.

Now, I worry about my listening cuz I feel like I should listen more. I have taken people’s advice in the past (doing incomprehensible input) and I am ok with it bc I can use subs. Sure, I may not get it whatsoever, but I have subs so I can understand. However, with comprehensible input I cannot stand it bc I’m still a beginner (middling/slightly high A2 rn) which means I have to listen to Peppa Pig &amp; other boring stuff. I tried doing the DW radio thing aimed for A1 &amp; A2 which I did for about 2-3 weeks maybe on and off. I really tried to listen to it daily but it always felt like a chore, and when I’d finished one episode I was so relieved. I literally had to force myself to listen to it (15 mins for one episode) and it was really painful tbh. Same with things like Peppa Pig.

Now I don’t know what to do. I stopped using incomprehensible input bc people said it’s a waste of time, and I tried comprehensible input but I genuinely don’t have the willpower to do it. I do have audio that comes with my textbook, but is that enough right now? The audio that comes with my textbook is comprehensible for the most part (although with some audios I have to replay it many, many times) and I do enjoy it. Is this enough or do I need more?

languagelearning,Does learning a foreign language at an older age impair your native/better-known language abilities?,"I’m aware of the struggles of people who are born into a bilingual/trilingual/(n)lingual family to sometimes differentiate among languages. However, I’m more curious about the arguably less fortunate folk, who’ve discovered that they liked languages later in life (teenagers-adults) and to what degree they are affected.

Personally, the more languages I know, the harder it is to keep my level, even at my native language or one I’m better at already. Does anyone else experience that, especially if you’re living in your home country and your exposure to a specific foreign language(s) could be considered rather low? 

I’ll illustrate the problem with my personal examples, in case it’s yet unclear to you what I’m talking about. Feel free to skip. It might appear like more of a rant and personal context (TL;DR at the end or refer to the title)

(I have read the rules of this subreddit and it might appear like borderline tasteless humor/too personal. That’s not my intention, I hope I can convey it well enough and present it merely as examples.) 

Lithuanian - native, English - C1 (idk, idc, certified, but really, i’m just trying to get by) Chinese - A2-B1 French- A1 production, B1-B2 comprehension, Italian A1, Russian - immeasurable, srsly, but it’s bad (A(-1) to B1)

EN to LT - Instead of using natural, appropriate words and expressions, I tend to translate from English and come up with terribly awkward expressions; Mix and match in a sentence - switch languages every second word (grammar who?)

CN to EN/LT - using the Chinese sentence structure i.e. Eat not eat? We going to the park mm? (No intonation) 

CN - it’s the most unique one in my list, so it’s easier. It doesn’t change that in times of despair, when trying to speak, I still mix in either French or German (not worth a mention, but German’s there in my subconsciousness) in my mind but never vocalize it.

&lt;slight hyperbolization&gt;

FR - boy oh boy, I just don’t function in it, if all else fails, English with a French accent. 

IT - in my mind, it’s French sans the oral cursive (don’t ask what I mean, just don’t), learn the conjugations, use them, speak French. On a good day, it works 2,3% of the time. 

RU - I speak it with a French accent. If I spoke it with a Lithuanian (native) accent, it would be like 5x more comprehensible due to SOME similarities between the languages and their pronunciation.

&lt;/slight hyperbolization&gt;

Okay, I’m done. If asked what languages I speak, I say “none” or sometimes, I say “all of them” and refer to myself as a queen of A1 levels.

AJATT or getting the Genki books, Japanese from Zero, Anki etc. Now I don’t know if its because as I student these methods remind me too much of a class or what, but ever since I realized this, I completely cut out “formal” learning methods. Now I know it’s different for everyone, but for me I felt like it was slowing me down. This week has been sort of a trial run for me without a set path to go on. The only thing I used to study was my tv shows, books and Jisho. I would watch my shows (YouTube videos as well) and start bookmarking them in my Jisho. So far I’ve only read children’s books and can sort of fill in the gaps with new words and sentence structures. Again, I’ll bookmark my new words and I’ve noticed that after seeing something new about 3 times, it’s pretty hard for me to forget. Sometimes I’ll watch the news, and even though I can’t understand almost anything, little phrases here and there stand out and I bookmark them.

Another thing that I feel like many might disapprove of is English subtitles. Only after I’ve watched a show or listened to a song a few times I turn on the subtitles and read the English while listening to the sound. I know some people say to only use target language subtitles but I feel like using native language subtitles is a more efficient way to expand my vocabulary. 

The results of my trial period have even shocked me. I can recognize more sounds, kanji and words than I did before. I was even able to read my first sentence that had a mixture of kanji and hiragana. Ive even began reading books for ages 6.

languagelearning,Intermediate/Upper intermediate Italian resources - what is out there?,"I am strongly considering learning Italian, mainly because I love the sound of the language as well as the food culture in Italy. I also am a big fan of a few Italian authors, like Elena Ferrante. 

However I am worried about what content exists at around the intermediate/upper intermediate level of Italian. Mainly, is there enough content? I am fluent in French, and I mainly advanced in French with the help of [podcasts](https://www.rfi.fr/fr/podcasts/) and [online books that came with audio](http://www.litteratureaudio.com/) (see links). Listening to tons of podcasts and audiobooks with transcripts was without a doubt the number one thing that got me to fluency. I know that I learn the best with resources like these after the beginner phase. I really dislike more ""formal"" methods of learning outside of the beginner phase (i.e., an intermediate level Italian grammar book...just please no...)

I also see this with friends who are learning Japanese or Korean - there are TONS of fun, real-life, more ""informal"" intermediate/upper intermediate level resources to learn these languages. There's pop songs, dramas, podcasts, anime, manga, webtoons with audio, etc. It really helps in staying motivated and learning the language more quickly and naturally. I'd like to find similar things for Italian if possible.

So my question for anyone learning/who has learned Italian: do you have any podcasts, Youtube channels, or audiobook websites (preferably with transcripts) that you know of? 

Also, a bonus question if anyone has any experience: how helpful is knowing French when learning Italian? I hear they are very related!

I'm not sure how to even progress with learning this language when 1)I don't what I can do to improve, as at least with other languages I have a strong idea if I'm a beginner or not, 2) I don't know what resources I have or should use to improve effectively for my specific situation.

languagelearning,Are some people just more inclined to language based on interest/perception?,"This applies to any language, but I am posting with regards to Japanese !!

I’m just interested in this consesus/facts on this. My best friend and I both love Japanese culture, history, plan on going to Japan and have been talking about it since we were 14!! We both listen to a lot of Japanese music, watch anime(I know that sounds stereotypical😭😭), and like to read abt Japanese mythology/history.

We have both tried, relatively casually, to learn basic Japanese for when we do eventually go !! 

I am deeply fascinated by linguistics, am in a major related to speech and language, and am very much an artist/visual learner with a good memory. I listen very closely to a lot of words, pay attention to and look into random kanji, and translate short texts out of curiosity a lot, and find myself already knowing more words and recognizing more kanji than I expected to as I (again, very casually) set out to learn.

My friend is less interested in linguistics/language as a whole, she doesn’t really listen for/pay attention to words that come up frequently in songs, shows, etc. She is finding it more difficult to recognize and remember kanji. Just as an example, when looking for a specific song on spotify on a Japanese album where all the songs are in kanji/kana, even if I don’t fully know the meaning, I can usually pick out the song we are looking for because I’ll recognize a few, whereas for her its usually more of a guessing game until we get the right song.

Do you think some people, whether it be something in the brain, or whether its just based on your respective interest/passion for language and linguistics, are simply perceptive or have an easier time learning a new language, even for something.. so..SO difficult as japanese !!!

languagelearning,Is it true that after you learn a second language it becomes easier to learn a third one?,"I've seen some people on YouTube saying that and I was quite shocked. I learned English almost completely by myself, by watching YouTube and speaking to myself, these were the two things that helped me the most, I believe. But I've been learning a third language, French, but when I try to use the things that helped me with English in my French I feel like it's definitely not as effective. It's so frustrating that on YouTube I can find videos I can easily understand and videos that I can barely tell a single word. It's also hard to find something that interests me and that is appropriate for my level (A2 or B1, not sure). When I was learning English I could easily pick up vocabulary from videos and memes. However memes in French are full of cultural references I can't understand (especially r/rance). I don't believe the French language should be that hard for me to learn, not harder than English, because Portuguese is my native language and it makes it pretty easy for me to tell the gender of a word. It's hard for me to find content for my level, I've watched so many videos on YouTube, it's either too easy or too hard to understand.",1625877752,santobaloto,16

I see people often get obsessed with trying to lose their accent cause they don't want to be treated like a foreigner but like a local.

It doesn't matter if you have no accent if you can only speak slowly and lack vocabulary. If you want to be treated like a local you must be able to speak fluently so that native speaker can talk to you the same way they would talk to a native speaker.

Now I'm over 30 years old and currently taking seriously on my English. Do I have a chance? I may have some difficulties remembering/understanding some small words like articles (a,an,the) or get mixed up when to use ""in"" and ""on"" in some sentences. However, with little practice and more readings, I would able to write fluently.   


I have been using Anki a lot. I'm studying 13,000 idioms (learned 6,500 idioms within 6 months). It's pretty amazing how many idioms I have learned can be found (in or is that ""on""?) Instagram, Reddit, books, etc. Currently, learning another half left of idioms. Hopefully, I'll learn all 13,000 idioms by end of this year. Then I would study the grammar again.   


One thing that scares me is that how the brain would be underdeveloped as a kid if he or she isn't exposed to a language. I didn't want this to hurt my chance to have a successful life with achieved goals. 

For those who are wondering, I know sign language. I learned to sign at 16 years old. It took me less than 1 year to be able to communicate well in sign language. Then in two years or so, I'm fluent in sign language with facial expressions. 

I don't consider sign language as a language because it is not something I can ""write"" with people in general. A sign language wouldn't help me to understand a written language as a second language.

So I've come to the conclusion that Child and Kid both are used to talk about young humans until 18 more or less. BUT you can also use ''Kid'' to talk about an adult who is younger than you and less experienced than you or even if they're around your age, you could also say kid just because, I've seen adult, old actors call others their age ''kid'' just because.

Did everyone already know this? When I learnt english at school, we were taught Kid and Child were synonyms but I think they're not??",1625792677,mai_hai,6
languagelearning,What languages would you like added to Google Translate?,"Google Translate is becoming bigger and bigger with, I think anyway, over a hundred different languages. I believe that we should add more and more, it is a useful tool for helping learn languages and also quick and easy good translations. For me, I would look to see:

&amp;#x200B;

Ainu: the native people of the Hokkaido prefecture of Japan, the most northernmost region. With less than 1,000 speakers is important that the language is preserved and maintained. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tlingit: a native northwest pacific Canadian and Alaskan people who are much alike to the Ainu, believed to have shared a common Siberian ancestor with them. Their language is very unique and their culture is unlike anything I've seen before.

&amp;#x200B;

Haida: basically the brothers to the Tlingit but related to different groups who crossed over from Siberia to Alaska. 

&amp;#x200B;

Kalmyk: a Mongolic language from the republic of Kalmykia in the south Caucasus of Russia. They migrated from Mongolia all the way to Russia, very great people. It was also used as inspiration for some of the languages of the creatures of Star Wars.

&amp;#x200B;

Manchu: the native language of the Manchu people, once powerful but now a minority. Very great people with a proud and long history.

&amp;#x200B;

Nivkh: similar to Ainu, on the island of Sakhalin. They were part of the Mongolian empire and became incorporated into what is now the Russian Federation. They are very unique and great people.

&amp;#x200B;

Guajajara: a native Amazonian people, a group which I feel are very underrepresented in the language world. There are many Amazonian languages that get overlooked sadly and they deserve the attention.

&amp;#x200B;

Tibetan: this one frustrates me since it is quite a prominent language. Tibet is and will forever be its own seperate nation and its language deserves representation.

&amp;#x200B;

Yolngu and Miriwoong: Australian Aboriginal languages from the north of Australia. There are currently no Aborigine languages on Google Translate which is a shame. I picked Yolngu because it's where Yothu Yindi is from and Miriwoong is just a very pleasant sounding language.

&amp;#x200B;

Greenlandic: since Inuktitut was added, I was thinking that they should also add Greenlandic too. It's a great place and around 50k speak it so why not?

&amp;#x200B;

Sioux, Cheyenne, Mohawk, Lenape, Cree, Mi'kmaq, Chippewa, Mohawk, Huron, Delaware etc: the Native Americans are highly underrepresented. I'd argue that they suffered the worse out of all of the native groups. There are still 2 million of them in the US and they deserve much more appreciation.

languagelearning,One year of language learning (Spanish) down! How many more to go? My progress and thoughts.,"**TL;DR:** I've spent about 1600 hours over the past year studying Spanish and have reached a self-assessed B1/B2 level. Below is an outline of what I did (Baselang, conversation practice, 350+ hours of Netflix, 6000+ pages of reading novels, Kwiziq, other misc stuff), where I'm at, what I didn't expect, and what I'd do differently.

**Going in:** Native English speaker with no prior Spanish knowledge unless you count words like hola and gracias. I don’t have particularly motivating reasons to learn Spanish other than I had lots of free time during the pandemic and wanted a challenge. I told myself I would stick to it for at least a year.

**After one year:**

* **Listening:** B2? I can understand news and dubbed television with &gt;95% comprehension. For example, minus a handful of words, I understand word for word [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq_KA3VVN-4) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPpxxf2MWc8). I have a harder time with native television series, movies and podcasts with multiple speakers talking over each other.

* **Reading:** High B2? Definitely my strongest skill. I read on Kindle and mark every word I don't know (even if the meaning is obvious from context), and averaged under 2 unknown words per page for the last three books I read (*Reina roja*, *La buena suerte*, and *Como polvo en el viento*), all of which are novels originally written in Spanish within the past 10 years. I definitely have the most trouble with slang, colloquialisms, idioms, cultural references, and ""localisms"" or words that have a different meaning in certain countries. My reading speed is slow but no longer painful at ~25 pages per hour.

* **Speaking:** B1? I feel pretty comfortable having a conversation about almost anything, though I certainly make mistakes and feel limited in what I can express. The last time I spoke to a new tutor, we talked about science fiction, and I explained the premise of the series The Travelers (which I watched with Spanish dubs). It involves time travel and is confusing in any language! I also talked about how science fiction has affected my view of society and the world. On a really good day, I'll make fewer than 10 grammatical errors in a one hour conversation, with more near the end when I'm getting tired. On a bad day, the sky is the limit.

* **Writing:** This is the skill I practice the least, so I'm not sure how to rate this. My spelling is generally good as I pay close attention to accentuation and check spelling with cloze deletion cards in Anki, but I probably don't write (or speak) very naturally. This is the skill I care about least.


**Phase 1: Baselang + supplemental material (~5 months)**

* Completed Baselang Real World program (Levels 0 through 10, including 130 electives) in ~4 months
* Podcasts: How to Spanish, El Washington Post, Radio Ambulante, Historias perdidas, TED en español, Asi como suena, Escuela de nada
* Youtube: Visual Politik, Luisito Comunica, Noticias Telemundo, BBC News Mundo, Platxi, DW Español, Vice en español, Alanxelmundo, Superholly, Tom Segura en español
* Newspapers / Magazines: El País, MIT Technology Review, National Geographic, NYT, Wapo
* Anki for vocabulary, ~50 new words per day

**Phase 2: Lots of input, some output (~7 months)**

* 350+ hours of Netflix
* 6000+ pages of reading novels
* Continued with 4-6 hours of conversation practice per week
* Continued with Anki daily, fewer new words per day than in Phase 1
* Continued with reading news, watching Youtube, and listening to podcasts

Going into phase 2, I was especially frustrated by my listening comprehension. Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/kmpzt3/250_hours_of_nonsubtitled_netflix/), [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/j1gbrg/spanish_listening_from_b1_to_a_solid_c1_in_500/) and a 10k page reading challenge, I started watching tons of Netflix and reading novels.

Listening has translated the best to improving my speaking skills. I often find myself saying things because they ""sound right."" Reading has been great for learning vocabulary and some grammar.

**Grammar and other stuff (spread out during both phases)**

* Conjugation practice, daily for the past 300 days. I maintain 100% in all of the tenses on the Ella app, which only takes a couple minutes per day at this point.
* Kwiziq for grammar. 90+% in A0 to B2 levels.
* Worked on grammar books but haven't finished them: Practice Makes Perfect Complete Spanish Grammar and MacGraw Hill Intermediate Spanish.
* Some writing here and there, but not very much.
* FSI Basic Spanish, useful but not very fun. I didn't finish it but plan to continue it in the future.
* [This game](https://babadum.com) is fun.
* [This number comprehension tool](https://langpractice.com/) is great.
* I also tried various apps that ultimately weren't useful.

**Total Time Spent: 1600 hours**

I did not track time, but I have stats from Netflix and Anki, and I'm estimating 20 pages per hour for reading, 2 minutes per Kwiziq test + 15 hours for grammar, and 3 hours per week for everything else.

* Baselang / conversation - 450 hours
* Netflix - 350 hours (not including any rewatching)
* Reading books - 300 hours
* Vocabulary / Anki - 300 hours (not counting time to create cards which was a MAJOR time suck)
* Grammar - 50 hours (not including Baselang)
* Everything else (reading news, non-Netflix listening, etc.) - 150 hours

**Some things along the way that I didn’t expect**

* I've read that it takes 1000 hours to get to C1 in Spanish, and frankly I don't feel particularly close. Maybe I'm underestimating myself, maybe I'm a very slow learner, maybe stuff like Netflix and listening practice don't count towards those 1000 hours, I don't know. Whatever it is, I feel like I'm still a good 1000 hours away from C1. I plan to listen to another 3-500 hours of Netflix to get my listening there, and reading another 10k pages at least. Plus I've barely scratched the surface on writing.

* The sheer quantity of listening I needed to do surprised me. All the advice about listening to hundreds of hours is spot on.

* Learning grammar is so useful! I know lots of people hate it and would rather spend hundreds of hours on anything else rather than 5 minutes of grammar, but if you can tolerate studying grammar absolutely do it. Grammar is &lt;5% of my total study time, but a little goes a long way.

* 1-on-1 tutoring is a pretty inefficient way to learn a language. Don’t get me wrong, I love it, but the real value came in how much more fun it was to interact with another person. I didn’t care if it took me 5x as long to go through the material.

* I'm a heritage speaker in another language, and I'm surprised by how different the languages feel. I am *very limited* in my HL, but anything I'm able to do is effortless. Either I understand something or I don't, there's no in between and trying harder to listen or make sense of something doesn't help. Maybe this is because my HL is distant from English, so there aren't really cognates. In my HL, I can effortlessly hear when others switch tenses, switch between tenses while speaking, and recognize spoken foreign words as being foreign. These take more effort in Spanish. On the plus side, reading and writing in Spanish are way easier. I'm illiterate in my HL.

**What I could have done differently**

If I *had* to learn Spanish on a tighter schedule and was willing to have less fun doing it, this is what I would change. Caveat: I don't know if I could keep up motivation without the fun.

* I would cut Baselang and most 1-on-1 tutoring / conversation practice. If there’s anything you can pinpoint that you want to improve other than pronunciation or ease in speaking to another human being, you can almost certainly do it cheaper and better on your own: grammar, conjugation, vocabulary, listening, even speaking, etc. For me, 1-on-1 tutoring is best for increasing my comfort level and staying engaged. BUT most of my actual speaking skills improvement were from outside sources. For example, I made tons of errors matching gender while speaking to tutors who would repeatedly correct me. It wasn’t until I started doing FSI drills outside of lessons that I finally internalized how to actually *do* that. It was like I finally figured out which muscle I needed to flex.

* Approach grammar in a more structured way. Instead of doing grammar first with Baselang, then with Kwiziq and Practice Makes Perfect, then with McGraw Hill, I would cut out Baselang and Kwiziq and replace them with a textbook or [StudySpanish.com](http://www.studySpanish.com) for an intro, then go straight to McGraw Hill with [Lingolia](https://espanol.lingolia.com/en/) as a good free grammar resource. Baselang’s grammar just isn’t very good, and Kwiziq is better for reviewing what you already know instead of learning it for the first time.

* Ramp up difficulty level in listening and reading at a faster pace.

**Going forward:** I wasn’t sure what I was getting myself into when I started, but now I am hooked! I love the process of learning Spanish and plan to keep going to at least the C1 level. I like the mental challenge, learning about various Spanish speaking cultures through reading, noticing the similarities and differences between Spanish and English, and I even kinda like Anki in a masochistic sort of way.

Sometimes I feel I ""should"" be making faster progress given the amount of time I've spent. I've tried upping the pace by cutting down on the less productive activities, but then learning starts to feel like a chore. I think if I want to stay in the game, I have to accept that enjoying the process is more important to long term success than being as efficient as possible in my learning.",1625772815,barbellicious,49

languagelearning,A fun exercise- look up the phonetic alphabet for your language,"In the United States (and maybe other English-speaking countries?), we use the [NATO phonetic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet) for words to clarify which letter is being referred to (e.g. rather than trying to spell out a word over the radio or phone with letters that rhyme and could get easily confused, you'd say ""bravo echo tango"".) 

Today I looked up what the alphabet is for Portuguese, and there are different words used in [Portugal and Brazil](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfabeto_radiotelef%C3%B4nico). It was really interesting to me which words were chosen, how they differ so much between the two, and how they relate to the culture of each country.

languagelearning,"How to get back, or start, ""Studying"" your TL?","The title might sound a bit strange, but, to provide some context, it's been almost seven months since beginning Spanish. I started with a lot of Language Transfer, completed the first half of Assimil Spanish, and have been taking conversational lessons since March. In April, I honestly got a bit lazy but have got back on track. Some time ago, I realized that my listening comprehension was weak and I had yet to consume any content in Spanish so for the past  two months, I have mainly only focused on consuming media, primarily through YouTube and podcasts, for usually 1.5-2 hours per day, while also taking conversational lessons twice a week with my online tutors. I definitely feel major improvement when listening and trying to understand content, and my conversations with tutors definitely run more smoothly as of late.

Now although I love the improvement I am seeing, I don't think purely consuming content in the TL is going to get me where I want to be in the next 6-12 months, and since I have two months until school begins again, I think this would be the best time to get moving. However, I am a bit stuck since I don't think I have ever truly ""studied"" Spanish in the traditional sense and I feel it would be greatly beneficial for me to try it out, even if I am a person that has never enjoyed traditional studying and find it more boring.

With that being said, what would be the best resources for this type of more structured, straightfoward study? Textbooks, SRS programs, etc.?

languagelearning,I don’t want to speak. Anyone else?,"**Tl;dr:** Not interested in making friends with natives and not particularly bothered about “using” the language to communicate. Anyone else?

So I’ve been learning Japanese for 2 years and have just started outputting. 

For a bit of background (**skip this paragraph** if you don’t care) I’m very introverted and derive much more pleasure from doing things in isolation, such as pursuing hobbies and studying, as opposed to communicating with other human beings. I don’t drink, party, go out on weekends, plan on getting married etc. Not because I’m socially anxious or have no friends, but because I would simply rather be doing other things.

And similar to many other people learning Japanese, I started because I wanted to watch those Chinese cartoons without subtitles like a true weeb. And I thought that it would be cool if I could **think** in Japanese. Note how this is different from wanting to **speak** Japanese. 

But at the time, and for a large part of my language learning “journey”, I don’t think I fully appreciated this difference. Whether it was because the pandemic hadn’t started yet and I was unaware as to how much I enjoy spending time alone, or whether I was just lying to myself, I convinced myself that I wanted to **speak** Japanese.

And now that I’ve finally reached stage 3 and am trying to start texting and speaking with natives, it’s become painfully obvious that I have no desire to make Japanese friends and communicate with them. I don’t even plan on living in Japan; I just want to consume their content.

I’ll still do things like improving my pronunciation because I find things like that fun in and of itself.  

I can’t imagine there are many other people who are learning a language on this sub and have this level of disinterest in speaking with/ forming relationships with natives.

languagelearning,"What's your opinion on this, maybe somewhat weird (?), vocabulary/anki approach?","I want to preface my post by saying that before using this method I didn't add new words to my anki deck regularly enough and often ran out of new cards to learn, so while for me this approach makes sense I'm rather asking you to see if you think my approach in general makes sense or maybe doesn't.
And also, I currently know about ~2000+ words passively (there is a quite accurate test for this online) so I'm not a complete beginner.

My approach is choosing some media I enjoy (currently an anime with TL dub and sub) and adding almost every word I don't know to my deck. The reason I'm doing it is that I thought to myself ""this word isn't common/important"" wayyyy too often and this held me back from learning more new words quicker and because my number one goal isn't language production but understanding the language well. Only after I do so I want to practice outputting more regularly (I'm using a method similar to MIA)

My idea behind this approach is that no matter how much specific, somewhat unnecessary, words I encounter, the most important ones should be there as well. And because I will need these words at some time anyway it doesn't harm me in any way.

This presents me from over analyzing and falsely assuming a word to be unimportant. But most importantly, it helps me get closer to my goal of learning 30 words a day.

I will continue to test this method for some time and then see how the results will be. So, what do you think about my approach to learning new words?",1625759951,El_pizza,0

languagelearning,What should my listening be like?,"Hello! I am currently middling/maybe slightly high A2 in German. Sometimes my textbook gives me audio (95% of the time with no transcript) but I find it really hard to follow. Like I can pick up words but bc they are speaking quickly &amp; some words are unfamiliar, I get lost very quickly. Sometimes I don’t have much clue what they are saying whilst other times I have a vague idea. In addition to this, these hard audios (some audios I can follow, whilst others are quite tricky. Is my textbook trying to challenge me or should I be able to follow along?) take about 10-15 mins to listen to bc I have to answer questions and so therefore I need to keep repeating the audio. The audio is usually only 1 and a half mins to 2 mins long though. This feels like a really long amount of time to be listening to it.

Is this normal or should I be able to follow it? I find it hard to answer the questions fully bc I get like half of it but then I can’t answer the rest of the question, as I don’t know what they are saying. FYI, I do about 30-45 mins of listening a day.",1625744543,Lemons005,14

languagelearning,Does a conversation's group size affect your fluency?,"After having lived in several countries, I realized one thing follows me. I always have trouble joining real life conversations with a group of native participants. When you add the fact that they may know each other (so they're likely to reference past events/memories), they will be using national/regional slang and informal speech, they may be discussing a current event or past events in the mainstream conciousness, and there may be ambient noise (in a bar, for example), it becomes increasingly difficult to join in or continuously participate. 

Even in a language I consider myself fluent in, in a culture that I obsessively studied for over a decade, if you put me in a room with a group of native speakers who are all ""shooting the breeze"" and generally in a good mood, I can't meaningfully join in, follow and participate.

languagelearning,"Torn between Norwegian, German, and Mandarin?","(I’m writing this on mobile, apologies for any errors!)

I’ve recently decided, after years of back and forth, that I want to finally learn a new language.  However, I’m absolutely torn on which one to learn:

Norwegian - I’ve always loved the history and culture of Norway.  Honestly, if I ever lived in a place outside of the English-speaking countries, it’d be Norway lol.  Also, I’ve read Norwegian is one of the easiest languages for native English speakers to learn, which had always caught my attention.

German - I have strong ancestral roots in Germany and have always wanted to connect with them, both by learning the language and culture.  I’m also an accounting/business student in uni at the moment, and have always heard German is the business language of Europe, something that leads me to learning the language.

Mandarin - this is sort of the outlier in the trio but for good reason.  The Chinese culture/history has always intrigued me and the nation is absolutely gorgeous, it’s a dream to visit one day.  Where China is growing so fast economically too, I’ve always felt Mandarin would be good to learn given my place in the business field.  The only thing that holds me back from choosing it is how difficult I hear it is (tones, characters, etc.)

Important to note, my goal is to learn all three throughout my life, I just need to pick one to start with.  I also understand this is a personal decision, but if anyone has any advice I’d greatly appreciate it!

Also important to note, I have a small speech impediment (ankyloglossia) where my tongue is abnormally short and anchored to the bottom of my mouth.  This means I can’t trill R’s or any sounds similar to that - trust me, I’ve spent years trying.  I don’t think any of these three languages have trills, but it’s just something I get nervous about when thinking about learning pronunciations haha.

The languages I want to learn are: Spanish, Portuguese, German, Norwegian, Swahili, and Mandarin.  It’s a wild combination, I know, but between my love of their cultures, ancestral roots, where I want to travel to, where I could see myself living, etc., this is the list I’ve come to lol.

What would be the easiest path to take in learning these? Like, do some of the languages have similar grammar or something that would make learning one before the other more beneficial?

languagelearning,Learning Chinese to get through the language barrier in our relationship,"I'm a guy living in Malaysia his whole life. I met a Chinese girl online through an online game last year, we hang out together, and at the time, I deem that as a friendship. We then lost contact with each other and never spoke again. The only way we can communicate is through Steam, but I never use it to chat with her.

Fast forward over a year later, I receive a notification on my stream profile, and it was her dropping some greetings, asking how I've been and whether I miss her. I was so moved at that time because I never expected to receive such a message, especially from her.  


I always knew that everything is banned in China. Discord, Facebook, Twitter &amp; Instagram. They need to use VPN to use those platforms. Despite that, she proceeds to make accounts so she could contact me. I fell even harder. Imagine having to open a VPN every time you want to chat with someone you could regard as a total stranger.

I found an idea and downloaded WeChat. I felt grateful. It was the right choice. She doesn't have to use VPN anymore, and WeChat's feature really big improvement to our conversation. She doesn't have to use Google Translate anymore; she can directly highlight my chat and translate it to Chinese. Yes, she needs Google Translate every time we chat with each other. Her English is too limited; she needs to use Google Translate to translate from Chinese to English. I fell even harder. She never gives up talking to me.

Every time I call her, I use the chatbox 90% of the time instead of actually talking to her. She could barely understand me, and she can't express her feelings very well; I can feel it. It was so depressing because using the chat box instead of actually speaking to each other sounds so sad. If only she speaks English if only I speak Chinese. She even said she will not take WeChat's feature for granted because even though I can translate her chat to English, she will still try her best to use English. After all, she wants to learn English so she could talk to me better.  


I decided too; I will learn Chinese, whether this is a stupid reason or romantic reason, I don't know. I want to make it work for us. Money, religion, education, culture is one thing, but not understanding each other in the first place is just too painful for me. I could've just worked it out with girls from my country, but that's not the problem, the problem lies within my feelings for her, I really need something to motivate me to push myself even further for this girl, I know some people will say if you truly love her then you could do it. I know, I'm aware of that. I just want to vent it to people, Will she still love me by then? it's not gonna take few months to speak Chinese, let alone read it.

languagelearning,Asking for help: How to learn my parents' first language/a language with very few learning materials?,"You might be confused by this title, let me explain it.

# Background Story

(It's not actually very important. I just want to write my story down. You can skip it if you want.)

My first language is Mandarin. However, Mandarin isn't my parents' first language, but second. Their first language is Wenzhounese, a dialect spoken in Wenzhou where they grew up. They've moved to another city where they have to speak Mandarin long before my birth. In case you don't know, Wenzhounese and Mandarin are two very different languages and not mutually intelligeble. It's like how different English and German are.

From what I can remember, people who took care of me including my parents, my aunt and uncle when I was a baby (or in the critical period), whose first language is not Mandarin, always talked to me in Mandarin even though they talk to each other in Wenzhounese in front of me. 

According to my parents, I could speak Wenzhounese before I went to preschool. But after I went to preschool where I only heard and spoke Mandarin, I stopped speaking Wenzhounese. Now thinking about it, Wenzhounese is never my first language in which case I couldn't lose the language ability that easily. It's a heritage language of mine. And although my parents say I could speak Wenzhounese, it can't mean I can speak it fluently, but only to a very limited degree.

And the pattern remains as I grow up -- They talk to each other in Wenzhounese and switch to Mandarin when talking to me. Yet I still grow some abillity of the language, mostly in listening. I could understand most of what they say in daily life, but still could only say few words myself.

About half a year ago, I began interested in learning the language actively as opposed to passively previously. So I asked them to talk to me solely in Wenzhounese. They were very happy about it.

# My problem

Since then, my language ability has improved a lot. But, it doesn't mean my Wenzhounese is good now. It's still terrible overall, just much better than before. **The main problem is that my vocabulary is very limited. And the worst part is that I don't have enough materials to learn from like I have when learning other languages. I don't live in Wenzhou, so I can't talk to a lot of natives, only my two parents. (I may move to Wenzhou in the future, but in the next 5 years I don't see how I can.) You can hardly find any films or tv series in Wenzhounese because it's not a major language (or dialect) like Cantonese. You can't find any systematic reading materials or courses to help you learn. All I can rely on (at least for now) to learn the language is my parents. I do have learned about some words about kitchen, food, or dining because that's where our conversations happen mostly. My concern is how to expand my vocabulary in more general things and other topics we don't really talk. (And after writing my problem down, I kinda figured part of it out myself, which makes me feel dumb to ask them in the first place.) Apparently I have to hear them say those words before I get to learn them.**

**Unluckily, I don't know what to talk to them because you know, we are parents and child. Therefore I feel like my vocabulary will never be complete. So I come to this subreddit to see if I can get any advice.**",1625683328,ERfReSCA,14

A little bit about me; I have been learning Spanish for the last 2 years almost and I think I'm around the B1 level (CEFR). I really love the language and would like to study in Spain to meet mostly local people so I can improve much more.  
Honestly I prefer going to Madrid because it is a bigger city there are more things to do I think and it's also central so it would be easier to go to other places in Spain.  
The issue is that I am scared that if I would go to Madrid I may get stuck in an Erasmus student bubble or that because Madrid is such an international city people will talk to me in English, both resulting in me not practicing Spanish as much I would like to.  
On the other hand there is Zaragoza a much smaller city with less inhabitants and I guess less Erasmus and other international students. So, I would think that it is easier to meet and become friends with the locals in Zaragoza than the ones in Madrid, but I am not sure.

Can someone help are the assumption I have made true? Should I go to Madrid the city I prefer or is it better to go Zaragoza the smaller city? If anyone has experienced (kind of) the same situation, what did you do? Why did you eventually choose the one above the other? Is it harder to become friends with the locals in Madrid or in big international cities in general compared to a smaller city? Any regrets? Experiences with other countries and languages are also welcome! Everything is helpful! 

TLDR; I'm going on a study abroad and my main focus is to improve my skills in the local language (Spanish) by meeting the locals, should I go the bigger city (Madrid) or the smaller one (Zaragoza).",1625662843,hous_jj,7

Hey guys, 
I’m sure a bunch of people in this community are foreigners that don't speak the language but wish they did. 
I am ready to offer a solution were we can have daily scheduled individual calls, where you can start getting the feel of speaking in arabic, making a conversation and building a sentence step by step.
It's more of a chat session and less of a class. 
And if we call it a class, then it's far away from being syllabus based or boring, but rather a non traditional easy going way of learning the language. That you can easily add an hour for it in your day.

I'm a native Arabic speaker, lived in KSA for 17 years  and then moved to Turkey for my 5 university years and currently I live in Jordan.

I have been tutoring English offline back then till now, and just recently started tutoring Arabic as well, and want to spread my work here over reddit, with a very symbolic rate for sessions :) 

Ofcourse you don't have to be a resident to message me XD just the will to learn Arabic!

languagelearning,Learning a new language through my secondary language made it easier!,"I am a native English speaker from America...AKA I didn't start learning a second language until I was in high school (around 14/15 years old). I learned German in high school and practiced it a lot on my own and even went to Germany for a few weeks, which helped my German skills immensely. I'm in my third year of uni now and started learning Spanish on Duolingo since it's useful to know in the US...but dang did I struggle. That was until a few days ago when I switched my native language to German on Duolingo!!! The gendered pronouns are so much easier to understand, and the verb tenses/cases make much more sense when going from Spanish to German instead of Spanish to English. It also forces me to keep using my German, so it's a win-win!!! Does anyone else use their secondary language to learn a new one? Is it by choice or is it because your secondary language is more common (for instance if it's English and your native tongue is Finnish) and allows you to access more resources?

I asked her if she wanted to hang out, and she told me that she did want to hang out soon, but she said she’s busy with work and it’d probably be in one month. In the past few weeks, however, she keeps on bringing up hanging out with her coworkers (not native and from her country, they came together for work) and going to different places with them on weekends. She asked me for a ton of recommendations on restaurants/outing for them to try. 

I’m a little frustrated because I feel like a human google at this point. Also, like girl I thought you said you were busy. Because she doesn’t know English that well, sometimes her texts also come off a little rude, but I know it’s not her fault. 

I’m not sure what to do because despite all of this, she seems like a nice lady. I’m also straight woman, so there’s nothing romantic going on between us. She told me once that she’s a little nervous about hanging out with natives. I totally understand, but I also don’t like being a virtual Yelp, and it’s obvious that she is not that busy.

**Spanish**-I have 3 years of experience from school but failed Spanish 3 by making a 60.So it’s been 5 years since I learnt it.Sadly since it’s been a while since I learned it I can only respond with basic words now but I can somewhat understand what people are saying.My motivation was my moms  family and just usefulness.

**Japanese**-I have learned from apps but was only decent at knowing Hiragana and a couple words.I learnt this after getting inspired to learn it and even knew how to write some of the characters.My motivation was just me liking how it looked and sounded cool and was at its peak.What made me want to learn it more was Anime.Something I want to do in the future if I can get good at drawing. I stopped because I was too busy with a full time job so I was drained to learn but now I don’t have one.

**French**-I have no experience at all with this language.My motivation for learning this is because I like how the language sounds and I’ve always wanted to speak in a nice romantic language like French.Another motivation is from hearing a favorite character from one of my favorite games,”*Overwatch*” speak it.Which by the way is Widowmaker.[An example](https://youtu.be/VhEHWJxwFPE)

languagelearning,What language should I pick next?? Japanese/Spanish? 3 Years after starting Korean..,"Native English speaker in the US and 38 years old. 

I had been studying Korean for about 3 years. Although, I have not studied very intensely for the last year. I have taken 5 university level Korean classes, along with a couple of continuing education classes. 

I made the most progress by memorizing flashcards with words and grammar points, using Pimsluer, 3 of the college classes were helpful, and using tutors on iTalki to practice speaking. 

Even after 3 years, I am far from fluent, but can have typical, very basic conversations. I've just kind of lost interest in Korean. There is a lot less learning material once you get past the beginner level. Watching TV or listening to podcasts in Korean is not helpful. I am not at that advanced of a level. Trying to bridge the gap to get there is certainly possible... but it will take a tremendous effort, and I'm not sure it's how I want to spend my time. 

Anyways, I have one more Korean class that's a month long starting next week. So, I intend to study and work hard for that class, but afterwards I want to start a new language. 

Obviously, I have an interest in Asian culture. I think Vietnamese is the most beautiful sounding language, but the pronunciation is crazy, and there will be much less learning material than what there is for Korean. 

So, I'm thinking of either Japanese or Spanish. Japanese, because I love Japanese culture and music. Spanish, because it is practical and so similar to English. Japanese would be more exciting, but maybe my brain needs a break and I should go with Spanish. Additionally, it would be a spring board to Italian, Portuguese, and other similar languages if I decided to learn them someday. The downside being, no one will be really surprised to see me speaking Spanish, on the other hand, when I (as a white American) speak an Asian language, it gets more attention. 

My concern with Japanese is the writing system. I don't even plan to try and learn Kanji...but would probably learn Hiragana and Katakana. I know they are more difficult than Hangul, but with several months of practice, I imagine I could get them down. Will not learning Kanji be a serious issue? I would plan to focus mainly on speaking/listening and not as much on reading/writing. My goal with Japanese would be to get more conversational than I currently am with Korean. For Spanish, I would desire to be pretty darn fluent. I would like to be able to watch TV shows, etc.. I should mention, even as an American, I have never studied Spanish before. 

As you can see, I am pretty torn between the two. Since I will likely be spending years on whatever I choose, I am trying to choose carefully - and then I want to go for it full blast. In case you're wondering, I don't want to study both at the same time. I have severe ADD as it is, and don't think I could focus well doing two languages at once. 

Any insight or suggestions would be appreciated!",1625605817,TerrifiedUSAMan,10

Basically, they focus very heavily on what I DONT know, instead of reinforcing what I do know (for me, there’s kind of a wobbly line between what I know and what I don’t know.  
for instance, i can have an idea of a grammatical concept but need practice using it in speech. Or, there are a lot of words I can write, but not understand out loud because I need to hear them being said. Id like to focus more positively  on this. You know? But I also DONT need them to explain it to me again. I need to use it) 

Today I had a lesson and basically the full hour was-

Tutor: do you know (word/phrase/idea)

Me: no….

Tutor: okay (quick explanation) do you know this?

Me: nope. 

Tutor: okay (quick explanation) do you know this? 

Me: no. 

And it’s not even things I would be reasonably assumed to know! It didn’t have anything to do with our previous lesson and I just got so disheartened because I spent ages studying this week. I thought I could come into the lesson with a lot of confidence, but I feel like this just pulled the rug out from under me. It’s exhausting to feel like a failure in every lesson. 

I tried to talk to her about it, but I don’t think she understood my English.  Also I’m not doing a great job of explaining it. 

I know tutors have to figure out what you do and don’t know. So I don’t mind this for a first lesson. But I strongly prefer it when they get a base line, and then move you into a text book, or just build skills with you.  You know? 

Is there a name for this? Has anyone else had this issue? How would you tell a prospective  tutor you don’t want that?  How would you succinctly explain the issue to a tutor you already have? (Who may not speak great English)",1625596262,ButterscotchOk8112,12

Also I am on several WriteStreak subs so that’s more time looking at screens.

Also I live in a country where my target languages aren’t spoken so if I want to talk to natives it has to be online. 

What can I do to learn a language without looking at a screen?

I’ve thought of a few things but if anyone has any suggestions then please leave them in the comments 

- Listening to podcasts 
- Reading paper books 
- Writing practice with a pen and paper 

In person language exchanges are an option too but they’re hard to find where I live.",1625586628,TomboXP,4
languagelearning,English Vocabulary Expansion,"For many people, Scrabble brings to mind old times with the family around the dining room table or nights spent with friends in a college dorm room or while on vacation. Stefan Fatsis, however, got his interest piqued to explore the competitive world of Scrabble through a *Sports Illustrated* article. This *Wall Street Journal* reporter decided to take his interest and turn it into a book. That decision led Fatsis to a strange and convoluted path of self-discovery and obsession; as Fatsis learns more about the game and the people who make playing it a career, he learns more about himself.

The club is free and open to anyone who:

\- can hold a conversation in English (so intermediate and up)

\- is willing to think deeply and engage in active discussions

\- is respectful to others and will be dedicated to attending the club regularly

If you are interested, please ***send me a DM*** in which you describe the following:

(1) Your English learning background

(2) Your personal background (just general details - where do you live? Do you work or study? What are your favorite things to do?)

(3) Which session would you be able to join - 7 am or 8 pm (EST time)?

languagelearning,Almost Native in English learning Spanish - How to remember grammar rules and vocabulary without Duolingo? Or should I just skip it since I know some of it?,"Folks I am at a crossroads of my Spanish learning journey. I have been using Duolingo a lot for the past 5 months or so and I have developed a small but significant vocabulary and knowledge of grammar from there. I have tested out and achieved the level 1 throughout the tree. Besides that, I am at level 4(orange) or better for almost all skills till checkpoint 4.

However, I have searched this sub and the r/LearnSpanish sub for reviews of Duolingo. Based on the user comments on those posts and my own experience, I can tell that Duolingo will not help me develop speaking fluency or even listening comprehension. Besides, Duolingo gets even worse after Checkpoint 5 - there are no tips along with the skills from that point onwards.

However, I am finding it difficult to retain vocabulary or grammar rules without practicing on Duolingo. I am exposed to grammar rules that I have not reached on Duolingo ( future tense , subjunctive) from Spanish native speakers on tandem and my italki tutors. But I don't get it to practice it hard and consequently, I forget it. I also tried Anki but I found it to be really boring. I am listening to Spanish content on youtube - Easy Spanish, Dreaming In Spanish - but again, there is no way to practice what I hear or read.

In this scenario, do you recommend an alternative way to remember grammar rules and vocabulary? Or should I just listen to a lot of learner content and trust language immersion perform its magic - something that will probably be recommended by refold.la believers?",1625566998,amarilloknight,6

German learning is tedious enough and I found this refreshing because I wasn’t engaging with it as a foreign language, only a grammatical system.

languagelearning,How to actually study my TL?,"
I'm not a serious language learner, but I've been having fun with languages since I was like 12 years old (I'm 21 now). I only speak two foreign languages well, and even with these two I have a hard time and I make mistakes all the time. (And by well, I mean on a  B2ish level)

Most of the time I just like to watch TV series in my TL or play some word games, read about the origin of the language etc. I realize, that it's not ""real"" or intense studying, most of the time I don't really force myself to study anything at all. 

I'll continue having fun with languages and immersion, because honestly I feel like it works for me - I can understand a lot in my TLs, and I feel like I understand the structure of the languages. However I want to implement some more intense studying into my study sessions, I was thinking like 15-30 minutes a day or every other day. 

What are some techniques or exercises that you like to do regularly when studying your TL? I'm looking for some tips on typical activities like reading a page of a book and learning all words by heart or something like that. I have basically no experience with this kind of studying, so I'm welcoming all kind of tips and input!

Anyways it's a little hard for me to follow if captions ever slightly differ (in practical meaning) from the text where I can't correlate a phrase or word 1-to-1 (like imagine if the video said ""Use the screwdriver to force the nail out"" but the subs said ""Remove the nail with the screwdriver""), so I'm wondering if this is a bad idea...

languagelearning,How I learn grammar and language systems (in a way that’s actually useful),"Hello everyone. I’ve been living outside of my home country and learning languages for about ten years now. I’m currently living in Jordan and actively learning Arabic (for about a year) and French (for about a month). For context, I’m also very comfortable in English, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, and German.

If you are enthusiastic about languages, people will often ask you “How do you learn a language?” or “What’s the best way to learn a language?” As we on this sub all know, there is not a straightforward answer. Clearly, direct context-rich, meaning-focused experience with the language is essential. This is what I often recommend to people. However, as a learner, I actually spend a lot of time (especially at the beginning) in grammar references, rote memorizing conjugations, and looking at vowel trapezoids and things like that. Basically, learning ABOUT the language’s systems and not exactly learning to USE the language.

Now this is something that I don’t usually recommend to people because it can be overwhelming. But if you have a special interest in language, a background in linguistics, or have experience learning languages, it might be useful to you. By having an understanding of the language systems, as you’re learning the actual language, it should help you better understand how what you’re learning fits into the system as a whole.

Let me explain what I mean using the two languages I’m learning now as examples. Already knowing Spanish and English, my progress in French has been very rapid. One of the first things I did was read through an entire grammar reference. Now this would be horrible advice for the average high school language student. But if you already have an understanding of how languages work, it can be helpful just to get a top down view of what the language can do/typically does. After, when you’re interacting with the language in more authentic contexts, you can have a context for the new language you’re seeing. You’re rarely puzzled or confused by what the language is doing because you have already seen what it can do, at least once.

So, for French, for the first 3 weeks I did:

1. 1.5 hours of Pimsleur listening lessons every day (to train my mouth to produce and my ears to perceive the sounds of French)

2. 1 hour of authentic material work (usually video games or movies, stopping to gather useful vocabulary or sentence structures when I feel like it. Otherwise, just general immersion)

3. 1 hour of Anki for vocab and rote memorization/recitation of verb structures

4. The rest of the time is reading through a grammar reference

The grammar reference helps give context to what I’m picking up from the other sources. Now, I’m only using authentic materials and speaking lessons to build up the SKILL of speaking French (because now I already basically have the KNOWLEDGE). So, after only 1 month I'm completely off learning materials and onto conversation practice and authentic materials. (This is only possible because of my previous knowledge of Spanish and English, two languages that are VERY similar to French. Learning languages usually takes a very long time, as we will see below. Also, I speak French very slowly. My ability to speak French is still poor, but improving rapidly because my KNOWLEDGE of French systems is robust).

It can be frustrating for learners at the beginning to communicate in meaning-focused contextually rich ways because you don’t have “all the language yet.” You haven’t studied the future tense or a particular past tense. But if you START with grammar, even if you don’t know it perfectly (you won’t), you will still have a FRAMEWORK for building your understanding when you encounter language in “the real world.” “What’s this? Oh okay, yeah, I remember this from the grammar reference. It’s cool to see it in context.”

Now, let’s see how this theory works with more challenging languages. Because I’m living in Jordan, the variety of Arabic that I’m learning is Southern Levantine Arabic. This poses many challenges that I won’t get into right here but, suffice it to say that it’s very difficult to find comprehensive grammar references or descriptions of Arabic OTHER than for the standard variety (Modern Standard Arabic, which is used in the news and in print, but unhelpfully not in the cafes or streets of Amman where I live). So essentially, there isn’t a grammar references for me to study from for the language that I’m learning.

So what I’m having to do is go through a Syrian Arabic textbook (which is Northern Levantine Arabic- similar but not identical to the variety I’m trying to learn), with a Jordanian teacher and essentially build my own grammar reference. This is painstaking work (but a labor of love if you think grammar is fun!). However, as I said above, for language people, I believe it’s a better approach than just listening to people and translating sentences with no framework. Because there aren’t any (really good, comprehensive) course books for the language I want to speak, building a framework is essential for contextualizing the natural language that I encounter every day. The alternative is just memorizing tens of thousands of words and phrases and trying to figure out a framework as you go. If you have linguistic knowledge, you can save yourself a lot of time by doing this first.

If you got this far, thanks for indulging me in such a long post. I hope it was coherent. To be honest, I wanted to write this up to help me understand what I’ve been doing and why it’s been helpful. As with many of you who have studied languages for a while, a lot of what I do is instinct based on years of experience and I wanted to try to articulate why what I’m doing might work for my own benefit. I will be happy if it was interesting/helpful for some of you too.",1625549615,TheLongWay89,7
