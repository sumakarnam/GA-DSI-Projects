languagelearning,I would like to dedicate the rest of my 20s to language learning. Any advice?,"(Age 24 from the USA) I've realized that the only dream I currently have right now is to learn languages. (Currently no dream job, no dream of marriage, kids, physical location, etc.) I'd like to dedicate the rest of my 20s to becoming proficient in a couple languages. I currently have a B.A. in Spanish but still struggle with listening/conversation.

The languages I'd like to learn over the course of my life are Spanish, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese. I know this is a lot, so I'd like to just focus primarily on Chinese and Japanese over the next six years. I'm basically a complete beginner in these.

I'd like to use my language abilities to interact and have friendships with people from other countries. So no need to use it for academia or a career.

I'm currently unemployed and living with my parents and I'm looking to get a job and move out. $20k in savings, -$26k in federal student loan debt.

Any recommendations on what type of job to get and where to move to?

Should I get any decent-paying job in the US and then just dedicate the rest of my time to online study and Italki tutors?

Try to support myself by working in Chinese restaurants/stores?

Teach English abroad?

Get a student visa and then try to stay afloat financially with part-time work?

Something else that I haven't thought of?

I'd like to give language learning my best shot while still relatively young and then focus on figuring out my career later. The career I've considered the most is teaching, so I'd be fine trying to break into that in my 30s after focusing on language learning for a few years.

I'd appreciate any advice and life-plan ideas, no matter how weird/normal they are!",1630453380,TheSweetOnion,25,298,1688,77,15

languagelearning,"The 10,000-hour method (ancient blog post by khatzumoto)","So, there you are. You’ve been mining your sentences diligently, but you still have trouble even following a conversation let alone participating, right? Maybe you still can’t follow your favorite series. Right. OK, I have a question for you. How much [language] are you listening to? Whatever your answer is, I can guarantee you that it hasn’t been enough for long enough yet. Which is why I suggest you:

Listen to 10,000 hours of [language] over the next 18 months. [(1) yes, there are more than 10,000 hours in 18 months: it’s called an estimate; (2) sleeping hours count, but obviously you’re going to want tons of waking hours, too — in any case, go for 24 hours a day.

Why 10,000? Am I obsessed with this number? Kind of. But, it is based on a rough calculation. I was fluent (perhaps not native-level, but definitely, absolutely fluent) at about 18 months. Over those 18 months, I listened to 18-24 hours per day of Japanese, which comes to 10,000 hours. Because my learning was input-focused, my listening ability was even stronger (much stronger) than my speaking ability; everyone needs to be able to understand more than they usually use — you don’t talk like a politician or a newscaster, but you need to understand how they speak. And in order to get to this state, you need to spend every waking moment listening to [language] — and every sleeping moment, too.

EVERY. WAKING. MOMENT. Of course, you may have school to go to, maybe a job. You can make small exceptions. But your school doesn’t run 24 hours a day, does it? You do sleep at night, right? Leave the [language] on all night. You have class, right? Listen to [language] in class if you can get away with it (i.e. if it won’t damage your learning experience). If not, listen to [language] while you do your homework. You take lunchbreaks, don’t you? Listen to [language]. You walk or drive or otherwise commute places, don’t you? Listen to [language] while doing it. You do have free time, right? [Language] owns your free time. You do sentences in an SRS, don’t you? Good — listen to [language] while doing your SRS entries/reps. Do you lie around and stare into space? Listen to [language] while doing it. Do you take walks? Runs? Go to the toilet? Take baths/showers? Eat? Hang out with [language]-speaking friends? Take road trips? Take plane trips? Listen to music? Surf the Internet? Cook? Clean? Wash dishes? Go shopping? Do pilates (sp?)? Tae-bo? Kung-fu? Listen to [language] during all those times.

Remember that silence thing? Silence has left the building. Every moment of your life needs to be soaked in the sweet water of [language] listening. I had Japanese playing even when I went out into the mountains behind Momoko’s house to watch the sunset. And in the toilet. And in the shower. And in bed. This is serious business, dude — I am not messing around and neither should you. We’re talking about learning a language here, not cleaning the sock lint from between your toes.

However I've heard from some people that trying to learn Dutch after German made their German worse because they kept mixing up the words. Someone even said that they had to intentionally forget their German to make any significant progress in Dutch because of the muscle memory interference.

I should also mention that I learned some basic Afrikaans throughout my high school years. Now obviously Afrikaans isn't widely used in Europe or an in demand skill compared to Dutch and German.

* Should I learn German at a high level, forget about Afrikaans and take on Dutch later stage?

I have been improving but feel as if it is only because of the amount of hours that I am studying and not the quality of those hours.

The routine goes like this.

I will listen to a 20-30 minute audio lesson, making note of any mistakes that I make. I will review and practice those mistakes for a few minutes, and then repeat the same lesson again. I will do this for 2 lessons. Next is a writing exercise. I will try to write a story using words from my vocabulary list from memory, making sure to use correct grammar and sentence structure. I will then record myself speaking that story and I will send it to a tutor for review. Each day I try to add more and more to the same story using more and more new vocabulary words. Then it's either a tutor session or Anki flashcard review. The tutor session is just grammar, sentence structure, etc. The flashcard review is usually around 100-300 words. The last hour or so is shows / movies with subtitles.

This routine usually takes around 4 hours a day mon-sun, so about 24 hours per week

I review flashcards at work when I am able to, and I also listen to music the entire night, which is usually 5-6 hours.

languagelearning,"""You can always cheat. Language learning is one of the few places where cheating is usually just another form of winning.""","In a recent thread on /lit/, a user writes:

&gt; I'm in the very early stages of learning ancient Greek, but I'm struggling with memorizing the case-endings. I feel like brute-forcing them is the most efficient way to learn them, but if anyone has some suggestions, please enlighten me.

Another user responds with the following advice:

*Post 1*

&gt; Brute forcing definitely works over time. In my Greek exams I would take out a massive piece of blank parchment and write out one or two full paradigms purely from muscle memory. That isn't a testament to my memory either, it's just how embedded they had become by then. But there were still things I struggled with too. I had certain ""routes"" I would take through the paradigm to eliminate ambiguities (easier to remember what form X looks like if you've already done forms F and T which are the ones you confuse with it most often and which ""blur"" your memory when trying to think). Rote memory really works. Eventually you just ""feel"" the structure of the table and you can fill it out by process of elimination even if you don't perfectly remember everything in 0.1s flat. But the more you do it, the more stuff will pass from ""remember it with a second of effort"" to ""remember it because I just remember it."" This happens through reading as well, but it's a nice boost to have the rote memory exercises on your side, and vice versa - you will eventually ""feel"" most of the obvious conjugations just from reading them so often.

&gt; Try using tricks like, obviously, remembering the signposts for very obvious conjugations (imperfect, aorist, perfect). But another key trick is to dwell on the thing I just said in the last paragraph: habitual use will make more and more of the conjugations come by feeling rather than a cognitive effort. Remember you're not going to be digesting a textbook forever. Soon enough you will be reading and translating, and much of what you currently find slipping from your mind will be ingrained in it. This will make the actual difficult or weird stuff that much easier to remember, because you will be expending the same amount of cognitive energy, but focusing it on fewer and more isolated things.

&gt; Trust in that process and in yourself. There's nothing magical about Greek. You WILL learn it if you just keep going. Imagine watching a TV show three or four times, then ten times. You'd start anticipating things you didn't even know you remembered, things you don't remember remembering. You could be an inattentive shitty passive viewer and you'd still be absorbing a thousand subtleties from the sheer repetition. That's happening in the background every time you feel like you're struggling.

&gt; Another trick is to remember that not all the conjugations and constructions are equal. You will mostly be encountering easy ""bread and butter"" ones, for the same reason the future perfect exists in English too but is super rare. When you do encounter hard ones, they'll stand out AS hard, and you'll be able to open your grammar and check them. That's normal. Don't get it in your head that you're ""learning Greek"" to be like a Greek-processing machine who recognises every form and decodes every page. Hate to break it to you but that's never going to happen. It happens even when you're a champion who has been reading Greek for years.

*Post 2*

&gt; Just finishing off this post. Above all remember the last bit, you aren't reading to have perfect memory of the textbook. Look at it this way: right now you are mostly digesting and remembering grammar and morphology facts. At some point, you'd like to be able to pick up a book and just read it. That's the simplest way to look at what ""learning a language"" is. But it's also too simplistic. The reality is there is a vast middle period between those two extremes, a hybrid period where you will have both a text you're working with and the textbook or grammar open. You will always be consulting dictionaries, glosses, grammars. What happens over time is not that you pass from phase 1 (assimilating and reviewing facts about language) to phase 2 (reading the language), but that you do less and less of 1 and more and more of 2, never really reaching the abolition of 1 altogether.

&gt; Not realising this was my big mistake when learning Latin and Greek. I stayed with the textbook and grammar way too long out of autistic devotion to being perfect before I was allowed to leave the shallows and really swim. But there's nothing to be lost and lots to be gained by just wading out and failing.

&gt; You could literally learn to read Greek reasonably well by half-learning morphology and just winging it with real texts, returning to the grammar as necessary. It'd be slower and (for most people, but maybe not for some dispositions) more tedious, but this has always been a valid and venerable way of learning. What you're doing by putting effort into memorising morphology is a modification of this strategy designed to make it easier and faster in the long run, not fundamentally a different strategy. Don't reify the textbook or deify the morphology tables. You can always cheat. Language learning is one of the few places where cheating is usually just another form of winning.

languagelearning,"Spanish, Catalan, and French in a single semester: too much to handle?","Hello all! I'm currently attending a university in the US with an especially renowned languages department. I went into my freshman year (currently a junior) speaking no French whatsoever, and, after having taken French classes during all four of the semesters I've spent here, I am now at a C1 level (tested B2 last year but have improved since then). I really enjoy learning languages, especially within a classroom setting (I lack the discipline to do so of my own volition), so naturally I've begun considering taking another language (or two).

My father is from Catalunya, Spain, and speaks both Castilian and Catalan. Unfortunately, however, he taught me neither of his mother tongues, and, as such, I'd like to take both languages, as they're both offered at my university. I know much more Spanish than I do Catalan (I'd say I'm a B1 for Spanish and A1 for Catalan).

Would it be stupid to take all three languages - perfecting my French, improving my Spanish, and beginning Catalan - in the same semester? I really want to, but I'm worried it might just preclude me from making any progress in the first place. Also take into consideration the fact that Catalan is essentially a bridge between French and Spanish, so learning it should be quite easy, just as Spanish should prove quite easy considering my having been exposed to it all my life.",1630358175,citadelledugel,6,233,1354,70,12
languagelearning,Learning Chinese after Japanese?,"Hello, it's been a long and hard process with my Japanese language journey. I'm now somewhere at N3-ish level after 2 years of study in university. I've been planning to learn Chinese ever since I got to uni, but the course wasn't available so I opted for Japanese first. Do you think it would be best if I first reach a higher fluency in Japanese before I start Chinese? Lexical similarities aside, I know that there really aren't much similarities with the two languages. And in terms of grammar and speaking, I'll have to start from scratch. I'm just concerned if it would be better to get to N2 first before I fully focus on Chinese (complete beginner &amp; self-study) or should I split my attention to both and learn the two languages alternately.

languagelearning,How to get the most out of my new teacher?,"Hi everyone,  


Quick background and context for my question.  


I'm planning on doing an Interpreting Masters in two years time with the focuses being on Spanish and Mandarin Chinese. This question is regarding my Mandarin.  


I currently have 200 hours of completed study in Mandarin:  
\-100 hours = Beginner apps, beginner youtube videos, note taking, beginner text books (HSK 1 content)  
\-25 hours = Italki tutors reading stories together  
\-40 hours = Active listening ( Viki shows, Donghua, Peppa pig)  
\-12 hours = Passive listening ( CCTV, Peppa Pig, Podcasts)  
\-5 hours = Reading (Graded readers)  
\- 18 hours = Other (Handwriting practice, making sentence mining cards etc..)  


As you can see from the above I am an input advocate and love the progress i'm making using these methods. However after only minimal hours of input, I am not nearly ready to start outputting. I'd ideally like to hold off on speaking and writing for a few hundred more hours. That being said, I've found a Mandarin tutor who is a male from Beijing with a similar tone of voice to myself. So he'd be perfect to listen to and copy in the future. Furthermore, he was also an Interpreter (Mandarin-English), so knows exactly what I will need to succeed on my journey.   


My thoughts were to use our time together to read stories together while staying 99% in TL, my output would be limited to answering yes/no questions and reading out loud.  


Do you have any recommendations or suggestions as to how else I could maximise time spent with the tutor?",1630340383,Gaelgeyr,2,262,1550,42,10

languagelearning,An Absolutely Amazing (and Detailed) Book Available Online as a PDF About Challenges Faced by English Learners From All Over the World,"I found a simply amazing book online that diagnoses problems that English learners have. Its called *Learner English: A teacher's guide to interference and other problems.* It goes into great detail about various challenges that English learners have in terms of pronunciation, intonation, stress, writing, listening, etc. As a native English speaker, it has even taught me subtle things about my language that I was not even aware of. It really gives you an appreciation for just how complex language is. Right now, I am learning Spanish, so I listen to a lot of native Spanish speakers. I can practically hear them talking when I am reading the Spanish section of the book.

I especially like the book because it goes country by country, so its fun to compare and contrast the challenges faced by speakers of one country to the challenges faced by speakers of another country. 

Hopefully I can keep in mind some of these challenges as I talk to my language exchange partners. 

Take a look at the book. Does it seem helpful to you? If you are a non-native English speaker, do some of the English challenges you have match up with those in the book? Are there any that are inaccurate or left out?

languagelearning,Languages saved my life,"Hey everyone ! 

I wanted to share my story about language learning and if some learners had some similar experience.

I am a French native and in 2020 I lost my job because of the Covid. As the lockdown start I felt immensely bad for this loss and couldn't find any work. Besides that I've always struggle with anxiety attack and overthinking. 
With nothing but time on my hand, I decided that I would learn Spanish again, which I studied at school for 8 years but didn't used since 5 years at the time. I wasn't very good at it back in school, A2 or something like that. Besides, it wasn't a class I liked very much.

So in may 2020, I start picking grammar book and manuals to learn it again. However, it didn't went well and  I was bored of it quickly. I was also putting a lot of stress to myself for not learning fast enough. In june, I decided to stop using books and just listen to it. Just the sound and it strikes me how beautiful it was. I then decided that I will go on but in a less pragmatic way. I swore that I will never compare my Spanish to a native or my learning speed to someone else. Just enjoying it, not getting stress if there was a word I couldn't understand. This way of treating like a hobby helped me so much. By june 2021, I was able to speak it at a C1 level. I used mostly Italkie, tandem and other ressources. I've start using the same mindset for portuguese since may 2021 and same result. I am at a B2 level already. 

As I learned I realised how much pleasure I took on my class and listening to ressources. It became a way to calm anxiety. Listening to Spanish was like a warm hug to me. It brought me also a lot of proudness and made me see myself in a better light. It helped me also taking the decision to try to heal my anxiety. Thanks to this, I have never be so good in my life both personal and professional. 

I see a lot of people stugling here and I am in admiration for the hard work lots of you put in your target language. But please never forget to take pleasure in it. Languages are beautiful and have the power to heal, to make you grow as a person. If you feel like giving up, just listen the sound of your TL. I hope it will remind you why you started. Because you admired a culture and wanted to be closer to it. Or because it help you with work. Any good reasons to learn ! 

Long story short, I would love to see if someone was saved with languages just like myself. I took the decision to never stop learning new languages until my death. I am looking to learn Italian now.

·       ¿Dónde vives? ¿Qué tipo de lugar es; una ciudad, un pueblo, una zona rural?

Vivo en Auckland. He vivido en Auckland durante catorce años desde que me mudé a los Estados Unidos. Auckland es una ciudad muy grande. De hecho es la ciudad más grande de Nueva Zelanda, pero no es la capital. En Auckland hay muchos países para hacer cosas interesantes. Hay playas, centros comerciales, estadios y mucho más. Para mí, me gustan mucho las playas en Auckland, son muy bonitas y limpias. Cerca de mi casa, hay una playa increíble llamada Mission Bay, donde me gusta mucho nadar con mi familia. 

·       ¿Qué es lo que más te gusta y lo que menos?

Pero, todo Auckland es increíble. Mi parte favorita es lo bonito que es Auckland. Cuando no estamos en ‘Level 4’, me gusta mucho salir con mis amigos y visitar lugares bonitos. Lugares como, bibliotecas antiguas, parques lozanos y torres gigantes. Sin embargo, Auckland no siempre es bonita. El clima es horrible. Ayer, quería pasear al perro, pero estaba lloviendo. Así, no pude salir. Creo que nueve de cada diez veces, va a llover. Pero en el verano, hay cielos claros y es muy bueno. 

·       En tu opinión, ¿Es un buen sitio para vivir? ¿Por qué?

En mi opinión, es un buen sitio para vivir. Hay muchas cosas que son buenas cuando vives en Auckland. La gente es muy buena, las escuelas son geniales, y las calles están limpias. Según ‘The Economist’ Auckland es la ciudad más habitable de dos mil veinte. Para mí, cuando estoy en Auckland, me siento más seguro y más feliz que en otras ciudades.

At that moment (summer 2013), I had one year of French at school and one year of listening to podcasts and reading books behind me. After having played ""Oblivion"" in my native language (Russian), I knew the game quite well, so I could focus on the language component. From the interface to in-game books, I tried to benefit from it as much as I could. But nothing could compare with dialogues!

* Voiced by actors, they allow not only to listen to native speakers, but to train your comprehension of different accents.  
* Being interactive, they make you focus. It's not a movie where you can sit back and relax, you can't afford missing the point of the quest.
* At the same time, you can go at your own pace - when the NPC stops talking, you can re-read what they've just said, check the dictionary, etc.
* There are a lot of generic characters, dialogues with whom are in some way repetitive. And repetition is exactly what we need to revise the new vocabulary and to reinforce sentence-building patterns, right?

There is an obvious downside: quite a bit of the vocabulary is not very relevant. After all, the conversation in the bar on a Friday night is usually not about enchanted melee weapons. When I want to upgrade my outfit, I don't go to ""Divine Elegance"" to buy a pair of huntsman leather pants. And I would hardly be able to maintain my real-life diet in Tamriel...

I am an English learner from HK, probably around B1-2 level. I learn English for both my exam and interest.

I use anki as my memorization tool (for that magical spaced repetition system), discover new vocabularies through Youtube, news, blogs, and any content that is in English. Every time I see a new word, I use the dictionary for definitions and different examples of the word in contexts(because another Reddit post tells me to do so to increase comprehension and easy to memorize), even though I did all this stuff including active recall, spaced repetition, I found myself still having difficulties recalling words I've learned when writing. Unfortunately, my English exam requires more high-level words to increase the accuracy of my writing.

languagelearning,Looking for perspective regarding French vocabulary learning (B1/B2),"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I have had 8 years of French in elementary school and highschool and am 24 years old now. I did very little with the language at age 19-23, but this year I started reading French comics (the magazine Le Journal de Spirou). I can read it just fine and guess the meaning of new words thanks to context. However, there were new words that kept coming back (avouer, désormais, oser, se dépêcher, empêcher...) and they didn't stick to my memory, so I decided to learn new words with Anki. I am already fluent in English so I have an idea which new words will be useful to me and which won't. For instance, old scientists with white mustaches use words I don't need to know. Parts of an airplane are not useful to me either etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I have now read approximately 660 pages and my Anki deck contains 534 words now. Learning them is pretty easy and honestly quite fun. I have never enjoyed learning French as much as now. However, I have heard people say they tried something similar but it will never end.

&amp;#x200B;

I am planning to add cards to Anki until September 2022, when I will start with Swedish classes. \_\_Hopefully by then I can read comics like a French 12 year old child? What do you guys think?\_\_ I did some quick math and if I keep encountering new words at this pace, I will have learned 2700 new words by then.

&amp;#x200B;

######Week 8

**Saturday**
Today I gave a score to Dragon Ball that's lower than the week before. I expected this to happen sooner or later because it is self-assessment after all, but it still
feels bad. Speaking of my scoring system, so far I'm pretty satisfied with it, I like how I made no mention of how well one should be able to follow the piece of content
on a whole at the lower levels, because this varied to great extent, depending on how much the visuals helped. 

But I'm not happy about a few lines I included like:
'understanding them[sentences] is 'the norm''. Although I do understand and expect to understand most of the sentences if I rate something above this score, it all
still feels like a miracle that I can understand them. This may just be because of how intense my learning has been, I knew basically no Spanish two months ago.

Also 'I understand the majority of sentences I see, but it feels like I still don't understand the imprtant ones'. I didn't get this feeling at all, when learning Japanese
this might have been the case, because I feel like cognates in Spanish seem to be more frequent in exposition dumps, the absence of which in Japanese lead me to not understand
'the important bits'. That, or I might just remember wrong and this didn't happen with Japanese either.

And finally I don't like my mentions of nuance, it doesn't seem to correlate in the way I thought with the other parts of my descriptions.

Going on a tangent about 'I knew basically no Spanish two months ago', I have to mention that this all feels very weird, I know it a sounds dumb but it feels
like the language is just made up, like it only exists in the bubble that is my room I use to immerse. This may be because Spanish was not a part of my life
before I started learning it, sure I heard a few songs and they spoke it in Breaking Bad, but for English I had video games, for Japanese anime and for German I live
next to the Austrian border, and the presence that Spanish had is basically nothing compared to that. The fact that I don't care that much about actually learning Spanish
might also play a part.


######Week 7

**Monday**
Phonology update: I think I can hear the difference between r and rr, other than that I'm pretty sure about afew things like: y and ll are the same sound, and they
only refer to one sound, the two different sounds I noted earlier seem to be allophones of this one phoneme, and that ü and u are the same sound. Of course I can't really
say these for certain, because there is always the possibility that I just can't hear the difference, but I have some conscious evidence for the former: the dude I mentioned
who replaces his y-s with a sh sound does the exact same thing with ll, and I hear certain words like 'yo' pronounced with both sounds that I think are allophones.

The one thing that I'm very unsure about is the sound they write with an h: I have no idea if it exists or not. If it does exist it is definitely different from a j
and it must be a much softer version of it. I do hear it sometimes but I also thought for a long time that I can hear the difference between English 'night' and 'knight' which I obviously can't.
It's crazy how much spelling can effect what you think you hear, and all the conscious evidence I have points towards the fact that the h-sound doesn't exist and that it's just a silent letter.
The evidence is the following: the word for 'and' is 'y' and is pronounced as 'i' but when it comes before an i it's an 'e' e.g. 'e importante'. But it also changes
before a hi like in 'e hiciste'. Second, I seem to hear the phenomenon I described earlier where phonemes aren't repeated at the borders of words also happens if there
is a h between two vowels as in 'voy a hacerlo' which would be pronounced as 'voyacerlo' I think. 

**Friday**
Today I switched from using headphones to using speakers for listening, and for the Youtube videos I watch it makes little difference, but Dragon Ball
is way harder to understand and I'm not sure why. Maybe it's because of the poor sound quality. Also, doing long listening sessions this way is a lot easier
for me. This, combined with my light week before has completely cured my burnout for now, I feel great.

**Saturday**
I came across a meme that comes pretty close to explaining some grammar, so I thought I should mention it:
https://www.planetaneperiano.com/neperianada/64174/latest/all/LO-HERMOSO-DE-LA-DIVERSIDAD-VERBAL
I was mostly aware of all of these and have a rough idea of what they mean except for the ones in the bottom right and some in the bottom left 
that I recognise by the ie part in them. I thought these was only one with that ie part but it turns out there are actually 3 (times 6 for the different subject of course)

Also, today I was reading a manga called Gantz and at around chapter 200 the already bad translation got so bad that they literally just leave half of it in Japanese
and just write the translation in the white space between the panels, but sometimes they don't even bother to do that. Luckily my Japanese reading is not as effortless
as my latin alphabet reading so I can avoid reading them.",1630225988,faceShareAlt,8,1135,6638,83,13

languagelearning,Which language to learn? German or French?,"
I’m enrolling in Med school next year, I’m 18 years old and I want to learn another language bc I love multilingualism and languages in general. 
I’m a native Spanish speaker and I speak English as a second language, I want a third one but idk which one to pick, my options are French and German. Some of the options I’m considering are:
- For German
I’m interested in German culture and also in the possibilities that are coming up for med students to study abroad in Germany or pursuing a medical residency. Don’t know if that’s a path I’m going to take but learning the language doesn’t sound bad in the meantime. 

- For French
It will be easier because I already know Spanish and english, I started learning French last year and managed to get a lot of vocabulary knowledge thanks to the similarities it has with Spanish among other factors. It also has more speakers than German does.

In conclusion, I could get fluent in French easier and faster than in German but also think that German could be more beneficial for my career.
Both cultures seem interesting to me and if we see the number of speakers, french wins.

languagelearning,Pimsleur upgrade has me learning three languages at once,"Not sure when/why it happened, but I hopped on pimsleur for my lesson in Mandarin (I fell out of regular practice, so it was to a point where I would do MAYBE two lessons a week despite paying 20 a month for the service) and noticed my account had automatically upgraded for free.  Instead of 20 a month for ONLY chinese, I now get access to every single language.

This has inspired me to learn multiple languages at once, which is nice because I get bored and like the cycling between different languages. 

Has anyone here attempted learning multiple languages at once?  It seems like I can apply lessons of linguistic learning between the languages, but am I going to hit a roadblock when it comes to vocabulary and cultural understanding?

languagelearning,Are there any bizarre rules in your TL or others you have heard of that make you think about reality differently?,"One of the things I like most about languages is how they offer a different way to look at reality through their rules. It is a little thing, but it always blew my mind that in Arabic you put the action verb before the name it belongs to, for example: Walked Sarah, Spoke Sarah. That it is as valid way of conveying reality as Sarah Walked, Sarah spoke.

I may be way off here, but isn’t the way that the Chinese see time, with less emphasis on the past, derived from tenses in their languages? I’m sure I heard that in a talk once. 

These reconstructions of reality are why I think it is important to preserve languages and why it would be sad to move towards a universal translator type system or an Esperanto. It can give you an entirely different reading of reality which is as valid as your own.

languagelearning,I feel like giving up,"This post might get removed for being low quality content but I can't help but share my frustration with people who might understand what I'm going through.

It's been 5/6 years since I started learning English. Those initial years were really great and I made some progress in the middle phase too. I adopted new learning techniques, employed immersion technique and everything that had been suggested to me from stopping to translate in my head to forcing myself to get stuck in situations that require me to speak English.

But these days, it's going really bad. I have not been making any progress and even seems to be making errors that are not expected from a learner like me. They say I'm already an advanced learner but I don't sure about it. I get scared when I have to interact with my professors using English and inevitably make mistakes. However, when it comes to formal writing or like creative writing(writing essays or notes), I do quite well. But when it comes to interacting with people, I fail miserably. It has gotten to a point that every time before interacting with someone, I make sentences and search them on google to find validation and if I don't find any similar structures, I feel like my sentence has errors in it and end up using the sentence but having regrets afterwards. My  lack of confidence has been getting me into a lot of troubles recently.  For example, I had failed to report my professor that I had sent them an important document, I wanted to say that I'm sorry that I hadn't informed him earlier with a direct sentence like "" I sent you my paper, I'm sorry to inform you this late(this as in the degree of late)"" and I did so but had regrets after sending it. Also my habit of making errors while typing is making the situation even worse. Instead of writing 'draft' I had written 'drift' and I didn't have the nerve to tell them afterwards. I'm fed up, I want to quit. But I possibly cannot because it's late. Do you have any advice that might actually help me interact better with people without me having to seek validation before?",1630134441,butterflyflewaway,20,374,2080,21,5

languagelearning,Learning new languages is hard for teenagers,"I am a 15 year old wanna-be polyglot and, as stated in the title, I find learning new languages to be hard for those in my age group. I have taken a serious interest in studying French and Japanese in my free time but find my motivation thinning no matter what I do.

All of my friends and classmates are too busy with video games, social media, and other random things on the internet that I hardly have anyone to share my language learning passion with and keep me motivated. Plus, the ones who do have some remote interest in learning a new language don't really take it all that seriously.

Since I'm just a kid, I can't book any classes for myself nor buy resources to help me as freely as I'd like to and have to use pirated textbooks online to study.

At school, I also get made fun of for being a ""weeb"" by wanting to learn Japanese; however, my desire to learn Japanese isn't just limited to opening Duolingo once or twice every few months, but rather, it includes me rigorously reviewing my Anki cue cards every single day and night.

Moreover, in my school, French is also a subject being taught. Unfortunately, the school system ABSOLUTELY SUCKS at teaching languages and, as a result, has made all of my friends hate the French language. This is kinda frustrating for me when I try to actually speak in French and people in my class just start yelling ""Baguette baguette baguette"" mindlessly.

The only solace I've found is using the Internet to connect with other language learners digitally (through Discord, Reddit, etc) but then again it's hard to form meaningful connections over the Internet and I rarely find anyone close to my age who's taking language learning as seriously as I am.

Anyways, sorry for the rant. I just felt like I needed to get this off my chest. Worst of all, Im starting grade 11 next year, which is the year that I've been told a multitude of times that ""grades matter"", so I already know I'll have less and less time to continue studying my languages.

languagelearning,Spanish or Russian?,"So basically I’m trying to choose between learning Spanish or Russian in depth. Some background, I am actively learning German and have elementary proficiency. For Spanish, I took high school courses and tested out in college, for Russian, it took college courses and get elementary proficiency on the military’s DLPT (the basic basic level of it).

So the differences for me are the I can pick up Russian better than a lot of my peers have and the Cyrillic alphabet isn’t hard at all for me. Plus I like to learn it and think it’s kind of cool. However, it isn’t widely spoken. Spanish on the other hand is widely spoken and the utility of it for work or travel is readily apparent, plus I don’t have difficulty picking Spanish up. However, I am not really enthusiastic about learning it and I feel like lots of people in America learn that for their second language if they’re going to learn one (go to any Midwest, rural high school and I bet Spanish will be the only foreign language offering if not accompanied by a remote learning French or Spanish offering).  So maybe I’m thinking it’s not as niche/unique to know here in America? Although it certainly would be useful and helpful since it’s our rapidly growing second language in the nation.

languagelearning,My progress and why you should keep learning,"For some background, I’m a mandarin learner who’s been learning serious for about a year and a half now. Almost a year ago, I started recording how long I spent each day studying/listening to/reading Chinese. In a couple days, I will reach the exactly one year mark, and I have recorded around 900 hours of Chinese study. Here are some things I’ve discovered.

1.) I never give myself credit for what I CAN do, but always beat myself up for what I CANNOT do.

I’ve gotten to the point in Chinese where I can randomly read a news article or internet article with ease, and can watch a YouTube video or show (with Chinese subtitles) and understand virtually all of what it being said. Theoretically, I should be overjoyed at this, since getting to this point was my goal not that long ago. But since there are still many things i have a hard time saying, I still feel like a beginner in a lot of ways. This is despite the fact that I can now hold conversations pretty well. Just remember to give yourself credit for what you’ve accomplished.

2.) keep going, keep going, keep going. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gotten lazy or thought about stopping, whether it be to learn another language or just something else.

languagelearning,Which grammar book if I'm kinda fluent in the language? English.,"Hey there!  


I tried to post it in /r/LearningEnglish but it seems that the sub is dead. So I try it here now.

In the year of 2017 I took an english test it was B2 level. At the speaking part I scored max points and got graded with C1. In the other parts writing and grammar I got B2.

Now 5 years passed and I got naturally immersed with even more english. I'd say my ability in writing, grammar, listening and speaking clearly improved.

Now the thing is the following: I'm pretty fluent but holy shit my grammar sucks ass.I can talk fluently and even write precisely what I want to say but I think I'm doing so many mistakes and often I'm really unsure if my output is correct.

To say it with a metaphor: I think my english ability is like a good crafted sword but it's dull as fuck. Now I want to polish and sharpen it up. And I think the best way to do so, is to drill some grammar because this is what I've never done in the past. Learning grammar. And I think if I get to know the rules I'm becoming more confident.

Can you recommend me something? The thing is I'm a little bit scared buying something and then get bored because I think I still know a lot but on the other hand I'm sure there are a lot of basic concepts which I don't know about. Is there a book you know about I could use to sharpen my english skills?Like a good grammar book in english for english?",1630016832,Noridem,6,271,1379,64,11

With a friend, we are currently creating a video game dedicated to language learning. It will possess all of the core elements of a standard RPG-adventure video game (story, gameplay, quests, etc) while being optimised for language learning by providing grammar contents, a personalised dictionary, cultural contents and more.

Our method emphasises the importance of spoken speech and the effective use of the language in authentic contexts.

Me and my partner have been thinking about learning Japanese for a while now. I am bilingual English/Dutch and she is a native English speaker.

We currently have zero knowledge of Japanese (or any Asian language for that matter), so we are struggling a little bit on how to get started. Because we both work full-time we need tools/resources to study at our own pace.

We are a little oldschool so hardcopy textbooks are not an issue for us but browsing on Amazon gives us so many choices for beginners that we are even more overwhelmed now.

We have also been looking at platforms like Verbling where you can get help from tutors as well plus we’ve been browsing on Udemy as well for pre-recorded video courses. We are willing to pay for quality material so that is not an issue.

Most of the information I have found seems to implicate that it's best to start with vocabulary and grammar first (in Romaji) before getting into the writing systems.

languagelearning,Suggestions on how to learn without translating?,"Hello Everyone :)

Apologies in advance for the long post! 

TL;DR: Ideas/suggestions on learning a language without the use of translating. 

I have been on/off the boat trying to learn different languages for forever now :P I have a “small”ish list of the languages I want to learn, each of which has a different reason for it. Throughout the years, I get super pumped and just as quickly lose steam and then I stop, only to repeat the pattern over and over again. I find that I spend more time trying to figure out *how* to learn + finding the resources rather than actually learning. THANK YOU so much to this sub for introducing me to Anki. Now my dilemma has continued and persisted and I think I’ve finally figured out why. Please bare with me!!

When I was a student at University, we had a language exchange program and my language buddy and I would meet every week and just talk for a couple of hours. They would point at things around me and say it in the language I was trying to learn (Brazilian Portuguese), then after learning a few words – they would test me on it. We also talked about our weeks, topics in general we were interested in and we would translate each other’s sentences, go over grammar/how to structure a sentence, etc. It was such an amazing experience! I got so good I was able to talk at a basic level about soccer and politics!!! But then my language partner had to return to Brazil and then I had no one to practice with so I’m basically back to full fledged beginner. 

I’ve tried different apps and I like certain aspects of some more than others. My favourite thus far is Rosetta Stone because it forces me to learn that language in that language rather than based on translating. I also find that when I am taught grammar in a more traditional way (i.e. this is an adverb, adjective) it goes completely above my head, whereas with Rosetta Stone I’ll notice the patterns presented (conjugations) and it sticks so much easier in my head, it feels almost intrinsic? My only qualm with it, is the lack of focus on pronunciation. Like in English, we have “ship” and “sheep” which sound very similar and could easily be mixed up. Or like how you make an R sound in English is different than the way you do it in Spanish (placement of the tongue). 

In my ideal world I would learn languages by basically trying to imitate being a baby/child: Learning the different types of sounds a language makes, learning words by pointing to things, stringing together basic sentences, immersing myself in different ways to learn more abstract words, and failing to speak properly over and over again (and being corrected) with a native speaker. 

I was thinking:

Purchase the Fluent Forever Pronunciation Trainer in my target language

Use Rosetta Stone

Find a tutor on italki

Find children’s books, youtube, radio, etc in target language just to feel more immersed 

Input new words along with image into Anki + Have a different deck in Anki dedicated to images and pronunciation (this idea comes from memrise but specifically the Russian course where there are images to help you remember how something is pronounced so like the letter п has a picture of 2 pillars)

I've been using Anki almost everyday for the past few weeks.
The problem is that I just create cards, but don't review them. It feels almost like a chore sometimes, even though other times it's a matter of starting the review and then I'm in the flow.

I'm a strong believer of reaching high levels in a language through reading. Usually I create Anki cards from the vocabulary words I don't understand while reading.

Is there an alternative to Anki to remember the words I encounter while reading? Because at some point the deck becomes too big and the daily Anki review can take like 2 hours, time that could be spent reading.

Or could you just tell me some pieces of advice about enjoying Anki more? Like, is there a way to set a maximum number of words to repeat each day (like 20 and not 200)?

The problem is that the fantasy genre (sci-fi, too) has too many words I don't know (usually for descriptions that help build the world of the story).

Technically, the faster you get it done, the less you pay in the long run. That means that if you are to hypothetically double down, you can complete 60 lessons in one month instead of 30 and end up paying for one less month in the long run. Why would they want that? They'd make less money.

languagelearning,Spanish and Italian - at the same time?,"Should I do it?

To explain my situation: my university doesn't offer any courses in Italian, so out of all the ones it offers, I recently chose Spanish. I've already signed up and got my books, started the Spanish course on Duolingo too. But now, another organization is offering a course in Italian in co-operation with my university. It's not as comprehensive as the Spanish course (1 credit less), but they both begin at roughtly the same time (I don't know the exact schedule of the Italian course yet).

I have almost zero prior knowledge of either of these languages, just a couple of phrases and a few words. Italian interests me quite a bit more than Spanish does, but the current situation is such that I can't just do the Italian course, it's either both or just Spanish.

How problematic do you think it'd be? I know the languages are very similar, but when starting from zero, would that be a help or a hindrance?

Now that I'm in post-secondary, I've learned how to handle stress, build structure, and have good habits -  but I have no time! I also have no money for apps - mayyyybe I could justify one.

languagelearning,Heritage Learner Finally Reached C1 After Self Study,"Don't really have any one else to share this with who would care (about language learning) so here I am.

About a year ago I became really interested in re exploring my family's culture and history. Improving my Spanish to be able to interact with the culture in its original element seemed like the obvious first step. I've been conversationally fluent my entire life thanks to Spanish being spoken by literally every one at home. However, at the start of this process, I really lacked a lot of literary vocabulary  (I had literally never read in Spanish, ever, apart from in businesses / restaurants) and specialized domain vocabulary. I also hadn't used my Spanish (apart from conversing with relatives from time to time) in almost 10 years. 

I did the opposite of what most immersion sites suggest -- instead of focusing on consuming narrow content, I basically just blasted my ears with 3+ hours of Spanish podcasts every single day, about literally any and every thing, often being discussed by numerous speakers. If at any point during my day I could have my earphones in listening to Spanish, I did. I would sometimes pause to quickly look up word definitions if it was repeated more than once, and quickly continue listening. I was very aggressive with vocabulary via Anki to start (35 new cards a day to begin, now tapered down to 10 a day).

I primarily consume content from the country my family is from, but don't shy away from content I find captivating that is produced by native Spanish speakers from other countries. I read a lot of YA books (where I can focus on engrossing myself in the story with very, very minimal word look ups) and spend 1-2+ hours a day reading almost every day. I also text all of my friends all day long in Spanish and have hour+ long phone conversations in Spanish with family and friends a few times a week.

I still battle with the subjunctive tense and make mistakes when conversing but people always understand what I'm saying. Overall I am still working on adding vocabulary (Feel like I'm always finding new words!) and my speed when speaking. (I can speak pretty fast but there's a noticeable increase in errors in re: conjugations / tense usage etc when I try to speak too fast). I have always had strong pronunciation so I'm not concerned with my accent so much. Sorry for such a long write up, this was a damn ramble. 

I guess I just want to say: keep going, and you will improve. Make the decision to interact with the language as much as possible every single day and there is no way you will not make some sort of progress. Thanks for reading.",1629875441,louisprimo,16,464,2602,52,8

languagelearning,What are some languages of which TV news announcers don't read aloud verbatim what is shown on subtitles?,"Hong Kong Cantonese is.  Not sure about Cantonese TV in other areas but they should be like Hong Kong.  I can't imagine news subtitles in spoken Cantonese.

Spoken Cantonese (SC) can be written but no formal settings would do so.  News subtitles are always in Standard Written Chinese (SWC).  SWC are close to Mandarin.

I think what news announcers see and read from their teleprompter is identical to what the audience see on subtitles.  They see SWC in the eyes and speak SC in the mouth on the fly.

I know they see SWC because they occasionally make mistakes that can't be explained if not SWC.  Example: possessive (the 's in ""John's Dad"") is 的 in SWC and is 嘅 in SC.  News announcers see 的 and say 嘅.  的 however is also in the name Baltic Sea (波羅的海).  This name is unchanged between SWC and SC.  Careless news announcers would blindly substitute this 的 and say 波羅嘅海, which becomes ""pineapple's sea"".  This is a classic joke.

languagelearning,How to teach myself chinese?,"Hello everyone! I hope that all of you are on track of your language goals! 
So i have an on&amp;off relationship with chinese, where i never progress past the very first lesson. The reason? I can’t find a system for this language! Every course i looked at was focusing on introducing the symbols and make you memorize the expressions, and i know how helpful and fast this can be to put you on track, especially conversational. The thing is that this is not how i learn. When i was learning Spanish i had to make sense and break down everything to the original grammatical rule first and understand the different usage of things before i can keep the phrase for life. Is there anything like that in chinese?
The other problem i have is the tones and pronunciation. Oh my this is the toughest ever. I have really hard time distinguishing which is which and needlessly to say I cannot even say them properly.
The last thing is the writing system. Is there any to begin with? I know there’s no alphabet but is there a way of scheming those symbols that makes them easier to retain?

i am doing a market research in order to validate my app idea.

languagelearning,What do you think about using the Koch method for ear training?,"By «Koch method» I'm referring to Koch's method of teaching morse code, which has this central idea:

Instead of first teaching you to listen to all the Morse alphabet at a slow speed and only then slowly increasing speed, the Koch method teaches you to listen to **full-speed** Morse code *from day one*. The trick is that you only get introduced to two symbols at a time. Once you can listen to those two symbols with 90% accuracy, you're introduced to two more symbols, and so on.

The reasoning behind the Koch method is that, if you get used to slow Morse code from the beginning, it's hard to then get used to full-speed Morse code.

I've been thinking about ***applying this idea to language acquisition***. My theory is that if you get used to slow audio, with **clearly separated words** during your entire “level 1” course, it's going to be hard for you to adapt to full-speed audio with **connected speech**, because it's not just the speed that changes, it's the pronunciation itself!

So, my idea is: Why not listen to full-speed audio with connected speech **right from the first lesson**, but only introduce a very limited number of words per lesson? Say, instead of Pimsleur's 15 new words per lesson, keep it at 10 new words per lesson, and focus on n-grams (chunks) instead of individual words. If the learner is using recordings produced this way, he/she can always lower the speed to 0.5x when stuck with a particularly difficult phrase, and it will still be natural speech... just slowed down. The opposite is not true: If you use slow recordings, it will not become natural speech if you speed them up.

After a bit of Googling I found that user emk shared [this exact same idea in the language-learners.org forum 4 years ago](https://forum.language-learners.org/viewtopic.php?p=64479#p64479). One of his comments resonated with me:

&gt; full-speed listening seems to decay much more slowly than formal grammar study and vocab lists. 

Back in 2017 I spent 3 months transcribing Chinese dramas by hand. This helped me a lot both with my listening and with my writing abilities when I took the HSK 5 that same year. I repeated the intensive listening exercise (minus the writing) with Shanghainese drama «Meteor Garden» in 2019, and last week I discovered that I can still remember some lines from back then!

I know some language learners have also used transcription as the core of their routine, and this has helped them immensely.[This thread in the language-learners.org forum is particularly encouraging](https://forum.language-learners.org/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=9631).

*TL;DR: Do you think that using natural speed audio right from the first lesson + only introducing a few words per lesson + making intensive listening (maybe with transcription exercises) to comprehensible input the very core of the curriculum... is a good idea?*",1629767893,SpanishInput,14,467,2865,63,12

languagelearning,My progress so far,"Note: this is mainly for me to keep track of my progress because I'm always losing my tracked information! But you guys can have a look at my language learning journey

I started learning Brazilian Portuguese during lockdown, so what I believe would be in april/may 2020 and currently I'm at around (I think) a B1 level. I made lots of progress very quickly considering I was self taught (but then there was nothing else to do in lockdown...). I'm now having lessons on and off from my partner and a friend whenever we're able but I haven't been able to practice my speaking as much as I like. From today I'll start scooby doo in Portuguese and focus more on speaking Portuguese rather than just reading and writing. I'm also not sure if I'm at B1 as, oddly, I haven't been able to find a good test for it. But I am able to have basic conversations in Portuguese with my partner about various topics, mostly when we don't want to include English speakers around us in our conversation 😅

And today is also the day I'm starting French! This will be less of a focus but I've been offered free lessons by a friend so I thought I'd take advantage of it. I'm not too worried about mixing up the languages as they feel quite different (unlike Portuguese and Spanish which I tried at one point, didn't go well) and I'll be focusing my time more on Portuguese and have French as a sort of 'breather'.

languagelearning,[Need advice] Building vocabulary out of the words you encounter spontaneously throughout everyday life,"Hello,

Here is the situation. Very often I come across a new word or phrase outside of the dedicated learning time. For example, I am simply *thinking about an everyday object or a common concept* and then realize that I don't know how it is called in my target language. If not the laptop, then the phone is always at hand, so I look it up in a dictionary (or I don't but I surely can). Or I may be just browsing the news in my target language or come across something in my Facebook feed. 

*My impossible dream*: the moment I see this new word/phrase, it (together with the translation and with an example of how to use it in context) gets added to an app that supports spaced repetition.

*Reality*: I don't do anything about this word/phrase. Most of the times, later I can't even recall what the word/phrase was (although I remember coming across some useful piece of vocabulary, so I am left with this frustrating thought of losing it).

*My realistic dream*: something in the middle, combining **a good habit** (that I have yet to develop) and **a good app**. Now, I would like to hear your ideas about these two components. 

1) If you succeeded in building your vocabulary in a similar spontaneous way, tell me your story! Do you put everything on hold and spend a minute to add the word, or do you make a quick note and return to your notes at the end of the day/week? If you struggled with self-discipline, how did you build your habit in the end? 

2) What app do you use? My ideal app should have *spaced repetition feature* (I used Anki in the past and quite liked how they implemented this feature there) and *integration with a dictionary* (basically, the ability to add words to my database right from the dictionary without selecting text, copy-pasting, etc., which is very cumbersome on the phone). If a word has multiple meanings, I would like to be able to add only selected meanings to my database.

languagelearning,Any French Tutor Recommendations?,"Bonjour! I'm currently learning French (A2/B1) and I'm struggling to find a great tutor. I'm an independent learner so I don't like taking grammar lessons, I just do it myself. This month, I started using iTalki solely for conversational classes.

The thing is, I learned french via an immersion program (Explore program in Canada), and I really like the format. I like learning words via context *than* translation. It's harder but I prefer it cause I remember words better in the long run.

I'm struggling to find a tutor on italki that can help me learn new french words **without** **any** **reference to english**. I have tried about 5 tutors so far.  I have explained to them what my preferred learning style is... Unfortunately, it hasn't been working. They still keep translating words. :/ 

Any recommendations?",1629663013,belle-rue,3,136,820,33,4

languagelearning,I think I hit a wall (English),"I've been learning English since I was like 7. I had it in school, but I wasn't really great back then. My mum signed me up for an English course when I was 10, I really enjoyed it and I was getting better, but I had a real breakthrough when I was 13 and discovered One Direction (lol). I learned about 2000/3000 words in 2 months, when I religiously rememebered every song by heart, every translation and every possible grammar rule used in them. Then, when I was 14, I was put in a group of 19-20 years old on that English course. They were preparing to take the most important exams we take when we graduate high school (an equivalent of A-levels I guess). I was struggling a lot but in half a year I catched up and... nothing has hapened since then. I never had to do ANYTHING in class ever since, I aced the same exams five years later (got 100% on both basic and advanced level) and haven't even opened an English book since I was 14. I went to uni, we had a year of Enligsh and I learned some of the basic business English vocabulary that is related to my degree. I am 22 now, I use English every day on Twitter, I watch videos in English, I search the Internet in English, I travel a lot (well, I did before covid) and after a few hours of adjusting I am able to have full conversations on different topics with people.

But I also still make many grammar mistakes, I hit a wall and I don't seem to make progress anymore. I would place myself at strong B1, but the exams I took are said to be around B2/C1, so maybe that's my level, I have no idea. I have always prided myself in never having to le-learn any words or phrases. I hear a word once and remember it for the rest of life. Well, I haven't lost that ability, it still works for me in Italian and Norwegian (zero boring vocabulary reviews, yay!!), but every time a see a new C1 level word in English, I just cannot seem to remember it. 

I feel like the only soultion would be to move out to an English-speaking country like I have always dreamed to do. I would be forced to learn new vocab every day, practice and enjoy the language. I don't know if I should force myself to continue learning. Maybe it is okay to give up, to stay on my B1/B2/C1 level, just enjoy the fact that I undestand 99,9% of content i see every day, be easy on myself and learn a new language? How much do I need a C1 English, anyway? I find so much joy in learning Italian lately, maybe that should be my new goal? Reach B1/B2 in Italian and then start with another language and another, stop pushing myself and just enjoy other languages and cultures now? Can anyone who has been in the same place tell me what worked for them?

languagelearning,How do I stay motivated while learning a hard language?,"I'm currently studying Japanese and over the past few months it's kinda been a struggle to just sit down and learn and I actually have a lot of free time to study.

I was first interested in the language when I was like 8 years old randomly reading about the origin of anime. But 8 year old me found the study materials online way too complex to understand. 

In 2019 a bit after I graduated from school I decided to learn a bit. I actually procrastinated a lot and only knew a few hiragana characters. Even throughout 2020 when I had a lot of free time because of the first lockdown I only knew a few phrases and very little grammar.

Back then in 2020 I was also learning some Korean and knew the writing system and basic grammar (I'm taking a break from it but I totally wanna study it later in the future). I do have some experience studying languages. I did study Spanish (in school) and French (at home as my family speaks it) at the same time and I find those languages to be fairly simple. I'm only able to have simple conversations in those languages. Irish was compulsory in school but me having a conversation in Irish is impossible haha.

It wasn't until February 2021 that I decided to take Japanese seriously. I joined a Japanese Discord server where I could practice with learners and natives and receive help pretty quickly. I learned kana pretty quick and I was excited to be able to partially read Japanese. On and off throughout the months of this year I've been trying to wrap my head around basic grammar. It's been a slow progress but mostly due to procrastinating and giving up. 

I wonder what my level would be if I actually started 11 years ago. I decided that I genuinely wanna master the language and speak like a native even if that takes 10 years to do so. But I always feel like I'm going too slow and that I'm not really making any progress. I do understand that it takes longer to learn compared to romance languages for example.

languagelearning,Studying a language at university is not a good way to learn.,"I was at a bar in Paris with my girlfriend and a friend of hers when an english girl came over to speak to us. It was pretty clear it was just because she wanted to practice her french, which is fine as it is very difficult to practice your french in paris if you don’t have french friends as everyone responds in english (unless they are old). 

I quickly noticed she was only a beginner  as she had such a thick english accent that it was difficult to understand what she was saying. She would also often forget simple words like ‘travail’ and would make frequent grammar mistakes, it seemed to me that she was translating directly from english to french in her head. Out of curriosisty I asked her how long she had been studying french for and it turns out she just finished 2 years of studying only french at university and did 2 years of A levels before that! This shocked me as, although I am only at an intermediate level, my level of french is much higher than hers despite me only self studying since 8 months. I don’t mean to say that in a cocky way, I make frequent errors and still have a long long way to go.

I have a feeling that possibly she simply just goes to her university classes but doesn’t consume lots of french content which would explain her low level.

Do you guys think university classes are worth it? I think for me, I would gain more value out of watching 1 hour of french content than sitting in a classroom for 1 hour. Also, one of them options costs £27,000 over 3 years (in the U.K.) and one is completely free! Also, what career options does a french degree really give you? It’s so easy to learn a language from home right now I don’t see the need to go to university.

She explained that her university course isn’t just about learning the language but also about french culture. However I don’t think university is the best place to learn about culture either, you learn about culture from living in the country!

She and her friend went to polish stores and pretended to only speak English to not only get better at it, but also to have some fun. At that point English was not common in Poland so they usually caused a minor inconvenience to the workers.

Today I drove hundreds of miles to Kraków, the second biggest City in Poland and decided to only use English whenever I go out. 
I went to the nearest McDonalds, put on my best British accent as its the easiest one for me to pull off and managed to order food. The lady panicked a little bit at the beginning but I understood her English and she was pretty good at it.
My next destination was a little cafe and I thought that since they're not a big business like mcdonalds maybe they didn't get many clients who didn't know English but I came in just at the right moment because I saw an old British couple and the barista having a nice chat in English. Managed to order coffee with a little bit of stuttering because my British accent started to slip half way through but I don't think she noticed as she was also nervous.

It feels really good to be able to communicate with people in your second language. It shows just how much I learned over the years.

It's also really funny how people get nervous when they have to speak English no matter how fluent they are.

I'm a Hungarian guy, who had learned English, and now learning Japanese. It's been a year since I've started my Japanese journey, I started it because I was bored in lockdown and always wanted to learn the language! 

My progress so far: I can read hiragana, katakana easily, and I have a pretty good understanding of the language, until I know the words! This is why I started reading recently (about a month ago), no not child books, since I found my vocab size is way beyond that, I usually read Slice of Life mangas that has furigana! Couple of days ago I started reading even more difficult mangas since I couldn't find more intermediate content (or at least not of my liking)! This way I read less every day, but introduce more words! (I usually read 1-2 chapters a day, which is between 60-80 manga pages, the most amount of words i didn't know was 132 so far, in a day).

So here's my question! Since I have about 10-15% of the words as new daily, should I read the same 60-80 pages more than once, to make sure I don't just look up and forget the words?  
Currently I read at the evening and than reread in the next day, once or twice, depends on my free time!

If you need additional information of my techniques to be able to answer my question, I would be glad to answer you!

languagelearning,HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO LEARN KOREAN?,"Hi, everyone! I've been a fan of Kpop and K-drama since I was in middle school but I never had the patience to learn the language. But recently, I've realized how fun would it be if I understood all the songs and drama without subtitles so I'm now committing myself to learning Korean.

Problem is, no one speaks Korean at home. How long would it take me to be fluent in conversational Korean without having someone to speak to at home? I listen to Korean songs and watch k-drama a lot so I'm quite familiar with the pronunciation and some subtle nuances of the language. 

Thank you in advance! Tips and pieces of advice are more than welcome!",1629564194,cookiemonstaw,4,118,644,38,8
languagelearning,Danish or Swedish?,"Hey everyone, 

I really want to learn a nordic language, and know the basics of both Danish and Swedish but I have come to an impasse of which to go full into. I was wondering if one is preferable to the other in terms of understanding other nordic languages? or is one of the other languages better? (finnish/norwegian?) I know danes get teased about pronunciations and the potato-in-the-mouth thing so I didn’t know if that was a hinderance to understanding other languages? 

I would really love to move to one of these countries, ideally denmark, but I have the feeling sweden will be easier to potentially wedge myself into considering my husband’s company has an office there. so basically neither is set in stone so I don’t know which to focus on in terms of language. 

also - are these languages anything like dutch if I end up in the netherlands? or is that a whole new ballgame?

languagelearning,I made a Chrome Extension (Free!) for us that enables dual subtitles on Netflix,"**TLDR**: Here's the extension:

[Dual Subtitles for Netflix - Chrome Web Store (google.com)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dual-subtitles-for-netfli/ljnmedkgcgidbbjhbkdonempgcgdhjfl?hl=en)

It uses the browser's built-in translator so just turn on the subtitles for your target language, and make sure the translator is activated (Right Click --&gt; ""Translate to \_\_\_"")

**It does NOT work when the original subtitles are in the following languages:** (Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Thai,  Japanese, Traditional Chinese, and Vietnamese). Only because they're injected with images so the browser can't detect them. (\*\*^(possible work-around mentioned at the bottom))

Yes, it is [open source](https://github.com/DeeFrancois/netflix-dual-subs#readme)!

# Why did I make it?

Dual subtitles are an incredibly underrated language learning tool! They make the method of watching a show with its native subs a little more efficient by making it so you don't have to keep another tab open to constantly look up words.

Unfortunately, it isn't a commonly available feature so I figured I'd learn how to make it available myself. After getting it to work for NRK TV (Norwegian service, extension available [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nrk-tv-language-learning/lmjfcijpnghdkpnoakgljodpjnimbakp?hl=en)), I thought I'd try getting it to work for Netflix.

# What's different about this one?

There are other dual subtitle extensions already but they all work by downloading the subtitle tracks for both languages and displaying them together. **The problem with that is the subtitles are based on the audio tracks, so often times you're seeing completely different sentences.** While that's fine for people getting familiar with a language, I feel like I learn way more with 1:1 translations (or as close to 1:1 as Google Translate can get).

Also, the other extensions are either not open-source, cost money, or they're too obtrusive. I just wanted something lightweight that felt like I was still just watching Netflix rather than using a full-blown language learning program.

Tons of people still find the other extensions useful though so don't just take my word here. Definitely check them out if you haven't already and if you think you'd want more learning oriented features.

# How do you use it?

* Turn on the subtitles in your target language
* Right click --&gt; ""Translate to English"" (or whatever your native language is)

That's it! You can also click the extension icon at the top for customization options and the on/off button. Since I wanted to keep it simple, the only settings are Opacity, Font Size, and Text Color.

(There are also two buttons on the player so you can still adjust font size in full screen)

I'm happy with how it is now but if there's a feature that isn't too obtrusive that you think I absolutely need to add, feel free to let me know.

# More rambling (sorry for the long post):

*  Incase you didn't know, you can browse for shows by subtitle/audio language here [https://www.netflix.com/browse/subtitles](https://www.netflix.com/browse/subtitles). Finding a show through there will actually enable audio/subtitle tracks that are hidden by default. (But just putting the language in the search bar is better for finding actual foreign shows).
* \***\*** You can also watch shows in your native language and then tell your browser to translate the secondary subtitles into whatever language you're learning (including languages that I said aren't supported). But I don't know if that's an effective way to learn and it's too many steps to ask of people so I don't advertise it as a main feature.
* Google Translate is not perfect! The accuracy is fine for me, but I'm someone that already knows enough to notice the mistakes. The benefit of using the other dual subs extensions is that you are guaranteed to get sentences that make sense even if they aren't direct translations.
* [Here's the link again](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netflix-language-learning/ljnmedkgcgidbbjhbkdonempgcgdhjfl?hl=en), please rate if you end up liking it!

* I can't make the ʁ or ɥ sounds

I feel like I'm just winging it and hoping for the best. 

The last time I learned a new language was five years ago. I don't remember having a hard time differentiating the sounds in Mandarin. If anything, it was making the ""c"" initial sound and tones (3rd and 4th) correctly. I overcame these issues on my own by doing audio drills. Now I'm putting in more time and effort with French but I don't see any sign of improvement. Since I'm a bit of a perfectionist, part of me thinks I'm expecting too much for someone who hasn't even spent a full month learning French.

I'm learning new words mainly with premade vocabulary Anki decks (a word on a side, translation and example sentences on the back). I suspect that the vocabulary is and has always been the limiting factor during my entire learning experience and I am curious about the whole word-learning process.

I'm wondering:

1. What methods do you know to learn new words? How effective are they? Do some become more useful or less at different stages of language learning? Do you use only one or combine them? Which one would you recommend the most?
2. Do you try to learn words bidirectionally (so that you can both recognize them and recall them) or only in one direction?
3. How many words do you think are needed to reach various milestones? For instance to be considered intermediate or advanced, to read an average fiction book, watch a movie or understand everyday conversations.
4. What do you think is a healthy range of new words to learn each day? An amount to learn a language quickly without running a big risk of burnout. (If you shoot a number or range, is it to learn words bidirectionally or only in one direction?)
5. Do you have any other tricks to share on increasing one's vocabulary quickly and effectively?
6. Besides learning new words what do you think are the other most important points one should try to work on? Did you ever feel like your limiting factor to learn a language was not the vocabulary, but something else?

languagelearning,Rosetta Stone is frustrating due to bad interface design.,"I just spend an hour trying to get past a single exercise. Farsi has invisible spaces that prevent letters from joining. (Imagine cursive, but you don't join certain compound words.) The people at Rosetta Stone have not actually tested their lessons because there are lots of places where there are two or more invisible spaces together.  There is no valid reason for doing that, it's an error!  It's also an error you can't see so this frustrating software flags the whole exercise as wrong but gives no useful feedback as to what's wrong. The software ""highlights"" the invisible space, which you can't see because it's invisible. So all you know is ""somewhere in this long sentence there is one or more hidden spaces that are invisible.""  You can't even test by trial and error because cut-n-paste does not work with the application.

To make things a bit extra frustrating, the sentences come in groups where the entire exercise is wrong if any part is wrong. So you need to type 4 long sentences that have multiple invisible characters correctly with absolutely no errors, or start over. It's the most fun I've had since getting a tooth pulled.

At this point I would take pretty much any other option for learning Farsi. It's very clear to me that no one at Rosetta Stone has done QA for this product and I hate using it. Getting stuck for hours on an exercise that should only take five minutes ruins the experience and sucks any possible fun out learning.

Suggestions regarding alternatives would be welcome.

languagelearning,Maintaining multiple similar languages,"Background: Last year I started learning Portugese and I would say through being pretty obsessed with learning I got to an intermediate level in about 14 months. Since then I've started learning Spanish for about 2 months and done little to maintain my Portugese (mostly just watch some YouTube here and there).

Portugese is definitely my favourite language but I recently started dating a Spanish native so now most days for a good amount of time I speak and hear Spanish casually. Because of this when I try to speak Portugese now I constantly accidentally use Spanish words making me sound dumb. I really want to maintain and improve both languages but I don't know how. Whenever I try to really improve one I'll become rusty with the other and when I return accidentally use lots of vocab from the language I've been studying more intensively.

Any tips to help with this would be appreciated. Sorry for ranting on a bit

I don't like French, and I don't really want to learn two languages at once so I decided to drop them both.

languagelearning,Learning grammar - how do I integrate it into my daily life?,"Hello, I decided to improve my English. I thought learning the rules behind grammar would help. I am 21 (male) and for most of my life, I am used to just typing/saying what feels right to me. And usually, I am correct (Although I do mess up here and there).  
But I feel like it's absolutely necessary for me to know Grammar. For those moments I am making mistakes, and also to know how language works (sentences structure) so that I can excel in other languages that are similar.   


I just finished with Present Progressive. and I knew what words I should add ""ing"" to (some were surprising, but not a lot). I mean, I didn't know why, but I know their ""ing"" form if that makes sense. So I basically just learned when to use it. In what situation.   
How do I integrate it into my daily life though? Writing is easier because I have time to think about the situation that I am in. But talking? It's much harder isn't it?

languagelearning,How do you properly make the jump to the more formal part of language learning? The jump just looks very extreme and it's killing my confidence and burning me out.,"For the sake of discussion, this is what I mean by formal and informal. For starters, casual spoken language is different from written formal language. Like what you'd hear and say in mundane conversations, tv shows, etc. would be different from what you'd read in news articles, magazines, etc. Second, informal in this case would be I get to choose which material I get to read, write, talk about, etc. rather than a random topic dictated by the proficiency test or the level dictating which words you need to know.

Most of my experience with studying Japanese for the last 8 years is on the informal side like talking with Japanese friends about mundane topics, watching anime, reading manga and light novels, sometimes playing games in Japanese, etc. The formal part of writing formal reports or the sonkeigo polite spoken language is something I've never had to do so it's something I've never practiced. While I sometimes read news articles in Japanese, I never read them with a magnifying glass with the intent of making a report about it.

While I was able to pass N3, N2 really kicked my ass. I absolutely had no idea what the reading passages wanted to say and it contained too many vocabulary that I did not know. It's a massive jump and the reading passages contained rather deep material. It's also worth mentioning that the Japanese Language Proficiency Test never tests speaking or writing so that's another reason that formal writing and speaking has been largely neglected. It's killing my confidence knowing that I can comfortably watch a lot of anime without subtitles, I can speed through manga but I have to bang my head against the wall to read and make formal reports about a deep topic I wouldn't normally talk about in my native language either. Like it's telling me that all the exposure I've gotten was all for naught because I chose to partake in media I enjoy and media that would be more relevant to my everyday life rather than drag my feet against the mud for the ""formal"" stuff I won't really need or I'm not interested in. I know that the formal stuff isn't going to be easy but is there any way to make the jump more reasonable?

languagelearning,Can't hear the difference between L and R sounds no matter how hard I trained. Should I seek professional help?,"\*TLDR - I've worked so hard on the issue for more than a decade like Cristiano Ronaldo trains in football but nothing really works. Should I just accept the defeat, or seek out for really 'professional' help?

The title says it all but it's a long post - please bear with me as this has been tormenting me for years.

My background: I'm a Japanese native speaker and this has been the biggest challenge for me ever since I started learning English 10+ years ago. I've really worked hard on it but no amount of practice or training doesn't seem to fix it and I've been honestly at the point of refusing to believe any native Japanese speakers (who have learned to speak English as an adult) are really capable of overcoming this.

Over the course of 10+ years I did my undergrad degree and graduate diploma in English speaking countries, worked professionally in English speaking environment for 6+ years, acquired C1+ level certificates in multiple European languages, have been in relationship with an English speaking partner for years, English has been my primary language in daily life etc etc - the point is that I really don't think the lack of effort is the problem.

I've learned to pronounce the L and R fine but that's only because I've learned to do so by studying where to place the tongue and so on - I'm actually not even hearing the two sounds differently myself when pronouncing. In listening, I've obviously learned to cope by just knowing a lot of words (so that I can figure out which letter is being said from the context but I often find myself feeling clueless when it is a name of place or person that I've never heard of), looking at the placement/movement of tongue if I'm talking to someone. I can hear rolled R or 'more exaggerated' R in some languages but in English I find it much harder.

This has been honestly TORMENTING me for years and I feel it is massively hindering my language learning too as I always have to visually memorize how every word is spelled. And I feel so embarrassed every time I get it wrong.  

I've consulted with teachers and friends in the past but I feel so frustrated as they seem to believe if I attentively listen to minimal pairs 10000 times, one day I would be able to hear the difference magically. Admittedly I'm probably taking too much pride in myself as an 'experienced language learner' at this point, but I'm genuinely sick of being guided to learning materials aimed at A1 level learners, usually slow-speaking videos made by monolingual teachers who never had to go through the issue themselves - now I'm thinking this is akin to showing different colour panels to colourblind people and no amount of 'practice' will cure this.

So, as a last resort I've been thinking about consulting a professional speech therapist/linguist of sorts, only if someone specializes in this specific topic exists. My concern is that it will be incredibly expensive and so much effort for probably what is a miniscule ROI. Should I go for it, or should I just give up and learn to live with it for the rest of my life? Has anyone (probably native Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese speakers as I've heard they tend to have the same issue?) else been struggling with this, or managed to overcome? If so, how?",1629349122,TheKochInstitute,80,577,3252,111,20

languagelearning,Am I in the wrong for being annoyed at a guy's pronunciation in my Ancient Greek course?,"Basically what the title says. I am currently in my second year of Ancient Greek and my class size has diminished to 5, including myself. I have this one classmate who is very book smart and generally excels in this course. My \*only\* problem with him is that he insists on using Modern Greek pronunciation when we're reading Ancient Greek passages. It is very hard to hear him read aloud, as he pronounces letters differently than the rest of the class. Even today, the teacher told him to say a word, then had to have him spell out every letter as he could not discern what word he was saying. My past two teachers that have taught this class have both not had problems with his pronunciation and have even been impressed with him. All of you linguists out there, am I being too nitpicky when I get annoyed whenever he ""pronounces"" Ancient Greek??

Why I think I'm justified: It's an Ancient Greek course, not Modern Greek. His pronunciation the majority of the time derails the class for about 30 seconds. We try and perfect our reading aloud skills, and he just makes it harder to learn how to do that.

languagelearning,Anki is actually so amazing. I never new.,"This is a bit more like a rant/story. I have been studying Mandarin for about 8 years independently (yes, I'm still not great at it and it is pretty much as hard as they say.)

However, I only started seriously committing hours to it about 2 years ago, and it's made all the difference. I have burned through several work books and hired a tutor and watch dramas a listened to podcasts, pretty much a little bit everyday.

During these times, I had heard tell of a mythical app called Anki, which was lauded as a language learners dream tool. At this point, I had no idea what SRS was (spaced repetition), I just heard ""Get Anki, Learn easy."" So I downloaded it and was... Unimpressed. I didn't really know how to control the information. I thought I HAD to make my own decks. It seemed like a lot of frivolous work just for some review. So I set it down and continued about my days.

Flash forward to a few weeks ago, I am still hearing all these things about a Anki, so I decided to give it another whirl, this time, with tutorials. Anki is a deceptively complicated program. All of your cards are shuffle-able into myriad decks, you can tinker and reorganize like crazy. The trick is to parse out the elements of the languages you want to learn.

Anyways, since I live in Taiwan, the proficiency test is called the TOCFL using Traditional Characters. Interestingly, there is a full 15000 word deck of all these words organized by level. Moreover, you can split the deck by level and learn things at reasonable interval!

Due to this discover and the functionality of SRS, I have expanded my vocabulary by about 300 words last week alone and have been able to find them in reading and listening EVERYWHERE!

I truly feel the level up, and I encourage you all to find find out which proficiency tests exist for your target languages. I guarantee an Anki deck exists for it and that you can RAPIDLY gain exposure to myriad new words and concepts.

languagelearning,LANGUAGE LEARNING — MOTIVATION AND SELF AWARENESS,"Hello friends! It's my first time looking at and posting in this subreddit so I want to share what has helped me become the most efficient in another language with you. Feel free to share your experiences in the comments 😁

AWARENESS OF SELF

Many years ago I became interested in the language of Korea - Korean. I knew a few phrases like 안녕하세요 and 네 or 아니요 but not enough to form sentences or converse with natives. I studied the alphabet, tried out language apps, writing, speaking, etc but after a few days I would ""lose"" motivation and wouldn't want to continue learning the language because it felt boring! I didn't ask as to why, I just quit only to come back a few months later at an attempt to learn again.

After some deep self observation these past few months, I realized what I was lacking - and that is self awareness. When I studied a language, I would study it with the goal of being able to learn it fully in mind. However I did not try to find the process of learning it pleasant as I only stuck to the end goal which made me frustrated and want to give up.

Instead of being aware of my own body and mind and constantly reminding myself of the reason I learned the language I did the opposite. So it was very easy for me to say ""fuck this"" and move on.

I never saw learning another language as ""hard"" or something that takes months or even years to do because I learned English fairly quickly (2 months). Same with other languages, Thai, Chinese, etc, I realized that it's very easy to pick up on a language when you make the decision to do so wholeheartedly and by learning the alphabet/tongue positions (which is why many second+ language speakers have accents!)

With a strong ""ground"" or ""soil""/""bottom""/(whatever you call it) for my language path I made a decision - from this day forward I choose to be aware of all the choices I make, not just for languages but for my life. You see instead of constant living on autopilot I decided  to take ""control"" of my life by understanding that I cannot know a language by wanting to learn it.

So these past few months I've been living like that, with constant realizations throughout the day that I have a DECISION to learn a language which always bring me back to it.

I'm also learning Thai, Italian, Mandarin, Arabic, Khmer, Tagalog, and etc with good pronunciation but still working on vocabulary 😁

Ser vs Estar, Preterite vs Imperfect, Por vs Para. Back then, it was too hard for me. And well, what I regret now, instead of starting to study harder, I started French instead and immediately fell in love with it. But I regret Spanish. My Spanish is a weak B1 and my French is around A2. I know that if I leave French until I ""learn"" Spanish, I will forget it (French) immediately, but interestingly, I don't forget Spanish. But that is irrelevant. Do you think I should learn both at the same time? Or should I rather learn French first and then go back to Spanish?

languagelearning,Uncanny Valleys,"Do native speakers (not of English, or of other major lingua francas) feel uncanniness when they hear foreigners speak their language imperfectly?

As an English speaking American, I think we're trained to understand English at all sorts of imperfect levels and accents from people around the world. But I have had this suspicion that for native speakers of languages which are not widely studied by non-natives (probably most of the languages of the world, besides some of the big former imperialist languages ie. French), hearing someone speak imperfectly in their languages is difficult to understand and/or creepy. 

We all had that experience when we started studying our languages (not counting English), native speakers would praise us for speaking even a word or two in their language. But as we get better, do those native speakers, especially strangers, have a difficult time listening to non-native TL? I think it might be more than just the usual wish for them to practice English, or defaulting to English in an international situation. As if it's just so rare to hear ""bad Laotian"" or whatever language that the brain can't register it. 

And, in addition, has anyone ever met someone who speaks their languages *very* well, but not fluently? Is there an uncanny valley effect to that? 

I'm not sure, but I really suspect there's a nails on a chalkboard experience for people who have to listen to me speak...",1629319322,andhangmyzen,12,236,1424,15,2

So I’ve noticed something about myself that I find kind of strange. I can speak English &amp; French fluently, but whenever I need to express my feelings—or when I’m sad—English comes first to my mind.

This one time I was crying because I was having an argument with my roommate (who speaks French only), and every time I would talk it felt like what I was saying had literally no emotions attached to it. My words felt kinda empty. It literally felt like I was translating my emotions into French, but it didn’t sound right. However whenever I thought about something I wanted to say (in English) I knew I could literally not even say any of those words cuz they would make me cry like a baby.

languagelearning,What are your most specific language learning tips for the languages you speak?,"When you learn a new language and its underlying grammatical structure, it seems like each new “milestone” is an ability to use more complex rules and patterns. What are some of these patterns, in the most idiomatic way to that language, can you describe? I’m wondering if chunking those pieces, in the most concise while most detailed way, applies among languages. Think it as a way to map universality of linguistic features.

For example, in Farsi the usage of verbs means that when two verbs are used, the first is in a present form with prefix mi- and the second one is in a subjunctive form with prefix be-.

Another example, from one language to another is from Spanish to Portuguese. When a word ends with the sounds “ble” in Spanish, it becomes “vel” in Portuguese. In the same way, “on” endings become “ao” and “les” becomes “is”.

languagelearning,SECOND LANGUAGE DILEMMA,"Hi folks, I need some advice regarding my English. English is my second language and I've been using mainly English for the better part of the last three years. I've never been to an English spoken environment or in a community. To better my English I quit doing everything in my first language except using it for dealing with basic needs and communication. English provides me with everything that I enjoy. For that reason, English has become a vocation for me. My favorite bands, writers, directors, singers, all of them are produced their works in English. I don't want to type a long post so I'll get into the dilemma. I'm so good at my first language since I read so many books, wrote so many poems and such in it. However, ever since I was able to do those activities in English I don't want to write in my first language. Since I'm inspired by English. By writing, I mean writing poems, songs, and some poetic prose. I do my best to work on my English but knowing perhaps I'll never be as good at English as my first, makes me think about gravitating towards my first since I can express, describe, create better in it. However, this thought seems to be too logical and practical. A utilitarian and logical approach. But my heart doesn't want it. I want to use English as a poet, as a singer, and songwriter. I know it is already tough to do these in your native language but as I said, I do my best. Besides, I don't think I could turn back to it. Back when I wasn't able to speak English I'd always read translated books, listen to songs in English despite not understanding the lyrics, and watching movies with subtitles. I was writing in my first because I had no choice. Writing is a need for me. A need to express and that happened to be a language that I was born into. Now I'm able to write in the language that I liked even when I wasn't able to speak.  Much obliged for any advice in advance.",1629303534,D3nbo,1,358,1910,23,3

languagelearning,Dunning-Kruger effect among language learners (especially Japanese) is detrimental for the whole community,"I am a pretty privacy conscious person myself so I stayed away from virtually all social medias my whole life. However, during COVID, I decided to push myself towards better utilizing all the available free time and picked up learning Japanese. Being a westerner, I am unfamiliar with the script and at first, like everyone else, I was utterly terrified of Kanji. However, I slowly started progressing, covering new Kanji, words and grammar points. I am still at a very elementary level but for the sake of gathering resource, I started frequenting /r/LearnJapanese subreddit. Over the past couple months, although I found a great many helpful folks sharing lots of useful resources, unfortunately I also encountered far too much toxic elitism. I felt like this is one of the specific area where Dunning-Kruger effect is not only too visible, but it is also harming the general language learning community as a whole.

I also checked other language subs and various Discord servers and noticed that this trend is fundamentally most common among westerners, especially English monolinguals. YouTube channels like Xiaoma promotes a sham unrealistic timeline of ""acquiring"" languages and combining that with the English natives' obstinate outlook towards foreign script, it probably answers why Dunning-Kruger effect is endemic here. Many learners expect to magically become fluent by seeing these fake online stories and shams like Xiaoma (I don't know about Chinese but his other videos on Spanish/French were laughably ridiculous), and when they fail to achieve their goal, they rave on internet. Instead of blaming themselves, like the upright westerners they are, they blame others, i.e. the target language, culture and people. 

I cannot tell how many times I have seen on Reddit and Discord of folks claiming why it is better to get rid of Kanji in Japanese or switch Chinese to Pinyin. These people are, in virtually all cases, eternal beginners. They love to create their own Dunning-Kruger echo chamber and parrot whatever imbecilic reasoning they have for their uneducated opinions. When these folks rant on forums, blaming the language, they inherently discourage and misdirect newcomers, who may think their lack of ""magical learning capability"" is not actually their fault, but is a fault of the language itself. The most stupid matter is when folks compare languages like their T-shirts, without inherently understanding anything about linguistic. I know internet has a terrible problem with narcissists, but seriously some people need to get off their high horse and get a reality check.",1629282844,GreatHuckleberry7811,147,413,2601,106,13

I'm a french native and I've been watching animes since elementary school (japanese animes/games are really a thing here).
 At the beginning I wasn't interested in foreign languages so it was pure entertainment.
Anyway I began watching animes in japanese around 11 yo, 4 years later I began learning Korean quite seriously. As time passed I really had that thirst to learn new languages. Eventually, about 3 months ago I finally chose to study Japanese as my 5th language. As my Korean reached a satisfying level and being coucious of the existing similarities with Japanese I couldn't not try. During those 3 months I haven't been that consistent because...life. Still, I learned about 100 kanjis (probably forgot half of them 💀), some basic grammar, tenses from genki and basic vocab. Almost nothing! But whadda you know? It's 1am right now and for some reasons I decided to watch an anime in jp and turned on jp subs.
Listen, I am shocked to see how much Japanese I understood... It's like my brain was understanding things without me even putting in the effort. The sentences I understood are ones that contains grammar points I never looked up or even thought about. Which is why I was speachless: during all those years of exposition to the language (99%passive) my brain actually sorted out the syntax for me and created something like a mini database of Japanese??? During all those years because of repetition my brain treated Japanese like a puzzle to solve, like how cool is that?? That's so interesting! Just wanted to share these feelings. I know animes are nothing like what conversations japanese people have and I'm not saying I'm a genius and hacked the language. Just saying that I'm glad I exposed myself to Japanese for all of those years and because now the journey to learning it feels genuinely less foreign and frightening.

languagelearning,Seriously regretting my college major after discovering my love of language learning,"Language lovers of Reddit, 

A few months ago, I discovered my passion for language learning, and needless to say, I am OBSESSED. Although my current goal is to become proficient in Spanish, I am also learning Catalán via DuoLingo. I absolutely adore absorbing content from Spanish media outlets, learning the vocabulary and lexicon of this beautiful language. 

I wish with all of my heart that I could go three years back in time to my first year in college. I would double major in Spanish and Italian, pursue a career in teaching, academia, or government contract work. As a total Humanities nerd who spends most days in the library studying and reading, this would have been perfect for me. I know that I can learn languages outside of an academic setting, but taking languages at university via intensive courses and composition classes would have been so enjoyable and fulfilling. 

But its too late for me to change anything at this point. A few semesters into college, I changed my major from History to Nursing because I wanted ""predictability"" and ""stable employment prospects."" Although I regret this decision, I only have two more semesters left of nursing school, and jumping ship to something else would add 2+ years to my graduation timeline. Nursing is okay, but it's nothing like what I envisioned it to be, and it's not something that I am particularly excited or passionate about. I am greatly concerned about the potential strain this career could have on me physically and emotionally from moving patients and caring for people during the toughest periods of their lives.

* Has anyone been in a similar situation? I.e. learning both languages (or any multiple languages) around the same time. If yes, at what age?
* Any tips and tricks if you've been in a similar situation?
* What are the drawbacks? What to watch out for?

After I started using LLPSI (essentially a reading course) and avoiding formal grammar about a year ago, I started to make great progress. I am interested in learning many other languages (Old English, Ancient Greek, French, German, Mandarin, Arabic, Tamil, Navajo, Basque, Georgian, Classical Nahuatl, Biblical Hebrew, Swahili, and perhaps something Celtic). For about half of those there are sufficient reading materials for beginners (I think I would use LingQ and readers), but how could I learn the rest? I have tried Jeff Brown's method for German and Mandarin, and it did work, but I found it to be too time consuming and inefficient as I had to travel to meet language partners and also had to help them with their English. I also had difficulty finding German language partners in London and there's no way I could find a Navajo or Classical Nahuatl speaker to help me. I much prefer to learn by reading; would I have to just find unadapted texts and struggle through them very slowly? Or would it be much more sensible to focus on the languages for which I can find materials? For some of them I could use Jeff Brown's method to get a foothold, but I do much prefer reading. I'm not really interested in any of these languages for practical reasons (apart from that I would like to speak Latin and Old English fluently); I am just a language nut who loves languages for their own sake.

You can compare languages to your own native language in the comments. 

Personally, I feel like the difficulty of Hungarian is vastly overestimated. I know it looks scary to a native English speaker because of the 18 or so cases, but when you find out what most of the cases actually are (basically postpositions) it's like the ""oooh scary 18 cases alien language"" just disappears. Its tense system is not as complicated as Spanish or Italian, it has no grammatical gender, it's pretty easy to pronounce and read, once you get into it it feels very ""logical"" like a lot of the things make sense because they're made up of smaller things that kind of fit like a puzzle.

Unfortunately, it takes a while to process new information and there's only so much new information the brain can take in a single day. The more new vocabulary you try to cram in a single day, the less depth you are able to absorb with each word. This leads to situations where I recognize a lot of vocabulary or at least feel like I've heard them before but I sometimes forget what they mean and I'm not able to properly use them because I haven't achieved that level of mastery yet.",1629087617,InsomniaEmperor,23,240,1321,96,19
languagelearning,Is it worth bearing with Pimsleur even though I kinda hate it?,"I’m trying to learn Croatian - have been using various apps and such (Mondly is the only one I like), I’ve had good experiences with getting to basic conversational experience in other languages with Michel Thomas so was looking for audio techniques and found Pimsleur. 

I’ve retained most of what I’ve been learning for the first 5 lessons I just find it incredibly dull as a method and feel really frustrated by the progress in comparison to MT method. I think the issue might be I was using MT for languages that are easier to ‘unlock’ keys to for a native English speaker than Croatian… but still. 

I’m going to Croatia in a few months and will be living with native speakers - I just want to get to a point where I can make sense of things in Croatian before then but Pimsleur just feels really slow.

languagelearning,"People who started learning a language 10+ years ago, how have things changed?","I feel like it's been lost on a lot of people how much easier and easy access things are now. So some questions:

**What did you start with to learn? What didn't you have?**

**What did your first 3 months to a year look like**

**What are some things that exist now that kind of astound you in comparison to when you started?**

**What's the one thing that's new or more accessible that has had the biggest positive impact on you?**

When I started none of the oldest most popular websites/apps existed. I started before Anki, AJATT, Duolingo, Memrise... between my cousin and I we had a paper dictionary, a pocket grammar book, a phrase book, and Heisig's remembering the Kanji. And a few websites with very sparse grammar explanations. 

I've had 2 people now ask me how I didn't realize something was wrong after 3 months of study when everyone else was ahead of me, and I laugh because the only people ahead of me had spent years longer than me at it. My first 3 months to a year I was happy to know a bunch of nouns and have basic grammar down. I didn't have classes or anything to guide me.

I think things are WONDERFUL now. There's been a HUGE jump in technology and accessibility. I have a dictionary on my phone! I've got access to subtitles in my TL now with virtually no effort! (as opposed to spending $40-$60 for a DVD from overseas). There's an obscene amount of apps with course work and flashcard decks.

The thing that's made the biggest difference to me is definitely access to subtitles in my TL.",1629075475,BitterBloodedDemon,29,278,1517,78,13
languagelearning,Question regarding the different sounds of English(vowels and consonants)," So my English has never been the best and I have not really tried to make it better, like everything else in my life. But now I have decided to get good at the things I want to be good at, and one of those things is that I want to be good at English. Because now I have started high school.

 About half of my English sounds good, just because I pronounce it the way I heard it (a bit like a baby learning) while the rest sounds crap. Anyway, you get pretty uncomfortable talking in class with that English. 

So now I started to learn English grammar(I don't really know how to learn it, so I am using this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVYfyTvc9KY&amp;list=RDLVAVYfyTvc9KY&amp;index=2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVYfyTvc9KY&amp;list=RDLVAVYfyTvc9KY&amp;index=2)

Then I am from Europe, and here you learn the British English accent, so I guess I would try to learn it. But how do you master (the sound of British English?)  The International Phonetic Alphabet or what it is called. this video shows how you say every letter or what you now call it. But how do you know what word uses what, like why is O in Hot and boring pronounced so differently, why? (maybe a bad example, didn't know what words to have as an example )I know how to say them, but I don't know why I say them like that

Apparently, Netflix has two versions of the show: if the language of your account is in English, the texts will be shown on screen in English but if your account is in German, the texts will be in German. This has nothing to do with the language that you choose for the dubbing, rather with the language of your account that you can change in your account settings.

######Week 6

**Monday**
So I guess it's time for an update on verb conjugation. I didn't find out much consciously, I realised that there is a separate form for 2PL that's distinct from 3PL
contrary to what I thought, same with the perfect and continuous forms, the former tends to end with -do and the latter with -ndo, and I noticed the existence of
what I call the hyopthetical form, because I don't know a general linguistic term for it, some examples include 'podria' and 'gustaria'. I have no idea about the actual
rules for conjugations, but I think I can conjugate certain verbs in the present tense. For example 'soy eres es somos sois son', 'se sabes sabe sabemos sabeis(??) saben',
'hablo hablas habla hablamos hablais(??) hablan' I think I can also recognise the past and future tense for the most part, but they are still fuzzy.


**Thursday**
It looks like the Amazon package tracker thing cickstarted my acquisition of the names of the days of the week, I still can't recall most of them, but I can recognise
them in context most of the time: the one that's similar to luna is Monday, the one that starts with a v is Friday, sabado(?) is Saturday and domingo is Sunday, two of the
others start with an m and one with a j I think, but I have no idea which of those is which.

I'm also starting to get the hang of the numbers, 0-10: cero uno dos tres cuatro cinco seis siete ocho nueve deiz, 11-05 are irregular: once doce trerce(?) catorce quince
and for other two digit number you make with 'name for the tens' + y + 'name for the ones'. 20 is veinte and 30 is trenta and I don't know the rest. For higher numbers
I think you just say the digit plus 100 1000 1 000 000 etc. which are ciento (sometimes just cien ?) mil and million respectively.


**Friday**
I am reading surprisingly slowly, it took me like 6 hours to read the first 100 pages of Harry Potter. On the bright side, I noticed that there are two distinct past tenses
as in 'estaba' vs 'estuvo' I'm not exactly sure what the difference is, but the latter feels 'closer' if that makes sense, so I'm gonna call it the recent past tense,
for example if someone says a good joke and you want to say 'that was good', 'estuvo bien' sounds better than 'estaba bien'. And with that I think I got all of the inflected
forms of verbs: present, past, recent past, future (e.g. iré), imperative (e.g. escuchen), hypothetical(e.g. podría), infinitive (e.g. caer), perfective (e.g. hecho) and
continuous (e.g. haciendo), plus different forms of these conjugated for the subject where applicable.

I used to think that there were also different inflections for different objects, but it's so much of an inflection as it is just appending me/te/lo/la/le/se/nos/os and
their plurals to the end or beginning of the verb. They are in a pretty straight forward correspondence with pronouns, except for 'le' which is used in place of lo/la
for indirect objects and 'se' which means something like 'one's self' in phrases like 'hide yourself'.

With that being said, I mentioned that this 'se' bothered me before along with 'ya' which is used similarly to 'already'. I didn't learn these today, it's just that
it's hard to pinpoint when exactly I learn something, so that by the time I'm sure I know it, it feels like I've known them forever.



######Week 7

**Thursday**
I started watching more Minecraft videos today and to my surprise, gameplays are not neccesarilly easier to understand than scripted videos about more complex things.
This is great because the Youtube algorithm is very good at making you waste your time, which actually works in my favor now, making immersion a lot easier.
This also means that I'm exposed to nontranslated Spanish for practically the first time, and it's not really aproblem to be honest, it doesn't feel any harder,
aside from the fact that I'm exposed to more accents, for example 'Miguel Gamer' has an interesting one where the main change is that he pronounces his y-s and ll-s
as an sh sound. I still find it a lot easier than European Spanish though. People also swear in English a lot, like 'what the fuck.' Although this might just be
because they are nerds. 


**Sunday**
I should mention that when giving my comprehension ratings, I'm not really thinking about it the whole week, I don't even remember my scale, instead, on Sundays or 
Saturdays, I ponder for about 30 minutes on each rating while immersing in that content. If the piece content I'm rating is shorter than 30 minutes (today should be first day that happens), 
that means I'll think about the rating for the whole duration of said content.",1629019673,faceShareAlt,10,998,5858,108,18

However from the apps I noticed myself failing in to being able to translate French writing but unable to speak nor form adequate responses l.
I have a friend who knows 6 language and would be happy to speak to me in French but in terms of Japanese I really don't know where to start.
What I wish to know is how to successfully study and learn a language. Given my financial situation and upcoming university is it even possible? Should I wait till I have my degree then start studying or should I focus on French with my friend first?
Thank you in advance for the help and support, hope you all have a good day or evening.",1628985873,Colonel_Floppsie,7,216,1123,25,5
languagelearning,Advice on getting back into learning my language of Choice (Japanese)?,"Japanese is my major and it’s a language I love, I love Japanese culture, media, history, they whole 9 yards. But ever since quarenteen I’ve been slacking in the Japanese department. I can’t even watch stuff in Japanese without it being a chore, me pausing and reading and not even paying attention to what is said (wich I know is horrible for language learning).

I’m going into my JR. Year of College, and last semester I got a C in my comunity college Japanese course, wich isn’t good. However when speaking to my professor, she said I was the best Japanese speaker she’s ever had, however, my grammar she said is a bit lacking in areas, especially with particles, and that I need to check for typos before I hand in tests. I’m transfering this semester and I will be on campus the whole time.

Recently, while getting in touch with distant cousins on my Ukrainian Grandmother side, I found out I have partial distant Japanese ancestry through my Grandmother’s mom’s side. And I might be descended from Japanese teachers in the Russian empire. Learning this fact got me even more motivated to learn Japanese, knowing about my newly found heritage in the culture. 

All day today I’ve been watching videos on language learning and language acquisition. So I feel this is a good step forward.

I do have a few conserns though

1) I will be on campus this semester and only have Japanese twice a week. I want to use the language as much as humanly possible, how can I achieve that?

2) I will be living on campus for the first time , how do I stay away from distractions?

3) Where do I start? Should I review grammar? Conjugation? The pages of vocab my old Japanese tutor tutor gave me when we read books and she would write down words I don’t know?

4) How can I relax in the language. I tried to play Pokemon in Japanese a while ago, but I haven’t really picked it up since. Not to mention when ever I watch something in Japanese I always have subs on, since I want to fully understand whats going on to talk about it with english speaking friends.",1628981673,CosplayThrowaway1015,4,375,2051,70,11

Last year, at least in my country, a new exam type was introduced, the “Mediation Exam”. In a nutshell, in this exam you must be a mediator, as the name of the exam says, between someone that needs information and you that posses it. For example, in the last exam, I must read an article that explained how to avoid Nedles Fear and then write an Email, summarizing the info of the article, to my friend Alice that needs to get vaccinated.   

The problem is that I don’t know exactly how should I study this exam. My school offers some models to practice and made some exams, however the number of exams is quite insufficient. Another method that could be interesting is make a writing and then summarize it as much as possible. What do you think about these methods?

languagelearning,How language learning changed me,"When I was 15, I was always a firm believer that English proficiency is an acceptable way to measure intelligence. I used to think of that for many years since I'm good at English.

Everytime I see someone make a grammatical mistake, I always find a way to correct them, sometimes not even correct them, but degrade them. I used to laugh at people making mistakes when speaking English. I was a very harsh person. Up to this day, I still think of every disturbing thing I have said. A year later, I came across at this one article entitled, ""Why you should learn a foreign language?"" and the rest was history.

I started learning Brazilian Portuguese as it was a Category 1 language. The whole experience was an eye-opener for me, to say that it broaden my perspective is a very big understatement. I used to ridicule people who are bad at English, with the help of language learning I got to reflect on those awful things I said. I had met my first online Brazilian friend through language learning, he was such a good person, encouraging and he's actually one of my motivations to learn it.

Learning Brazilian Portuguese made me feel vulnerable like a normal English learner would, like in a minority. I was once in a receiving end of degrading comments about my Portuguese skills and it hit me hard. Like really really hard, I lost motivation and the drive to learn it, gladly I recovered from it and still learning it. I reflected and reflected on it. Sometimes you have to be on the receiving end of what you've previously do to experience the damage it can cause. 

By that experience I became more sympathetic towards less privileged people and people I'm different with. After all the experience I had with language learning, I realized now why most monolingual Americans (US) are probably harsh towards the minorities because they never get to experience first-hand the adversities the minorities experienced and they're not open to other cultures and languages other than their own. There's no better way to connect with their heart other than speaking their language.

I actually think at some point on our life we need to atleast learn a foreign language, it can be a worthwile experience you will forever cherish. Now I'm 16, and it's crazy to know that after a year I can correct everything I was wrong about and change my perspective about something for the greater good. After all the things I have experienced, I'm glad one of it was language learning and I'm glad to be a proponent of wonderful possibilities it provides. Learning a language is definitely worth it, educate that mind of yours. Goodluck to your language learning journey! I hope all the best of luck to you all! 🤗",1628939128,RupertRobbed,82,474,2698,32,5

languagelearning,An Idea for a YouTube Channel (with a caveat),"Let me start by saying that I know some of you reading this will think this is a bad idea. I have my doubts as well. I've asked one native speaker, and he thought it was a good idea. So I am putting it to the group to get your thoughts.

I'm thinking of starting a YouTube channel, and what I have in mind either doesn't exist, or it's simply not done often enough for me to find any examples. (Or it's a horrible idea and that's why no one does it)

I don't want to specifically teach the language nor do I want to give language learning tips — those are the two main types of channels I peruse. Basically, I want to practice speaking, and if I am going to be doing so out loud, I might as well have the camera rolling.

It wouldn't be just a Spanish vlog or a comprehensible input sort of gig, though that's the closest thing I can think of. There may be the occasional tip or whatever but mostly me reciting prepared scripts.

# Here's the ""bad idea"" part: I'm not fluent. Not by any stretch of the imagination.

I put my reading comprehension at an A2 or B1 depending on the text. My casual speaking is about as beginner as it gets...well, not that bad. I can say some stuff. But I'm definitely not confident. My pronunciation isn't bad (though not perfect), so if I have a prepared script, I won't necessarily sound like a native, maybe more like an intermediate learner with the occasional pronunciation slip.

Here are a few things I've thought of doing.

* Read a book meant for children (not necessarily meant for beginners though if I find one approved by a native, I wouldn't mind)
* Read a passage and break it down in English—this is most likely where any specific learning or teachable aspects might happen, such as how I remember the meaning of a certain word.
* The typical comprehension input video where a simple story is told (like Dreaming Spanish)
* Dialogs between me and my daughter
* Chats with natives (later on once I can hold a decent conversation)

# So, first of all: good idea or bad idea?

*Second, if it is a good idea—or at least not a completely horrible idea—do you have any other ideas for videos?*",1628928262,MasqueradeCrew,22,399,2134,45,9

How do I know when I’ve properly learned it? Is this efficient? Is that efficient? Am I using my time effectively? Etc...

I need a structured, organized format...a roadmap. If there was an app that tested you through lessons, videos, exercises, etc...and finished off each lesson with a pass/fail quiz...that would be perfect. I feel like I have too many options, an app for this, an app for that, videos for this, books for that...and everyone says to go in a different order.

I know this post is scatterbrained but I started German recently and i feel like I’m not using my time wisely because I’m always jumping around.

languagelearning,Question About Vocabulary Size by age,"So I was looking up studies about vocabulary size in native English speakers, and I found some odd stuff.

In this site, [they have data about the vocabulary size by age](http://testyourvocab.com/blog/2013-05-08-Native-speakers-in-greater-detail). The problem with this study is that it was self-assessed and it doesn't differentiate active vocabulary from passive.

So I kept looking up other studies and found [this source](https://www.superduperinc.com/handouts/pdf/149_VocabularyDevelopment.pdf) that was mentioned in a Wikipedia article. It says that a 6 year old knows about 2,600 active words and 20,000-24,000 passive words. Then it says that 12 year old has a passive vocabulary size of 50,000 words. Now that seemed a lot to me and I was wondering if they had a different definition of 'passive' vocabulary (they call 'receptive' instead of 'passive').",1628898578,WasdMouse,5,136,934,37,6
languagelearning,Is learning Italian first the best basis for Moving onto other Romance Languages? Also is Italian (or the various languages of Italy) the closest of the modern Romance family to Latin?,"I was told by a few multilingual language that Italian gives a basic middle ground between all the romance language in that for example while a Spaniard will understand a lot of Portuguese easily without any prior study,  he'd have a much harder time with French and won't understand most Romanian basics.

Italian on the otherhand not only has a lot of similar pronunciation to Spanish in addition to word but also shares a lot in common with French structure and in addition was deemed on a quick google to be the closest language to Romanian of the Romance family. And its a big help plenty and plenty of other romance languages such as Sicilian are within the modern Italian borders and islands nearby Italy as well as also in regions cross Spain like Catalan and various islands and port locations in the Mediterranean that were major trading hubs dominated by Italian merchants in the Medieval Ages.

So plenty of people tell me Italian is the best starting point as a result of being in the absolute center ground if you plan to specialize in romance languages. And its a big help that Italy is the capital of Catholicism and most cultures with Romance tongues are primarily Catholic and that Italy is one of the economic superpowers of modern times.

It is all for this reason I was also told that Italian is the closest to Latin of the existing Romance languages in their current form. So I was told specialize in Italian first if you intend to go deep into Ancient Roman studies because its the closest (and it does't help Italy is where the Roman Empire's heartland was so you'd have to learn it anyway if you start Latin language as a hobby).

For some reason this guy got it in his head that I'm a beginner and it's a live study blog or something? I don't know how many times this guy has popped up and sent me videos to ""cheer me up"" that involved basic grammar (unrelated to the original post), or told me to keep studying and not listen to others (when I gave my input about generic discourse), or admonished me for making posts about method and that I should focus on actually studying instead. He seems like he's looking for someone to take under his wing that he can coo over or something. It's really weird. I've explained to him several times that I'm past the point of even study anymore.

I think he gotcha'd me today because I don't know, and won't bother, reading super archaic writing... which seems to be his specialty.

However she was able to memorize at least a thousand of english idioms, spoke fluently like a native speaker, and had exceptional listening skills.

Other platforms that allowed you to have f2f conversation with another person like discord were non existent. Facebook was not even a thing in 2010s at least in my country.

languagelearning,It takes a while to be comfortable with reading so ideally you want to practice with something that doesn't require you to look up words often.,"It's a common dilemma for us language learners when there is something we want to read in our target language but they contain a lot of unknown vocabulary. Even if you know every single word, understanding the meaning of the sentence or the passage as a whole takes effort. If you have to look them up or try guessing the meaning through context clues, that's additional effort and you'll be burned out before you know it. While being uncomfortable with uncertainty and not needing to know every single word is a sign of comfort and mastery with the language, the little holes in understanding because of so many words you didn't know adds up and you'll end up missing out on an important detail or two.

Another reason for this is reading speed. If you're used to reading stuff with a magnifying glass and looking up a lot of words you don't know or having to stop and guess what that new word means, you won't be able to read stuff at a normal speed as native speakers do. It's not a waste of time even if you know 100% of the words since reading them gives you additional exposure and reinforcement to those vocabulary.",1628827422,InsomniaEmperor,16,205,1122,143,26

languagelearning,Learning multiple languages at once,"Hi, I am currently learning four languages with Duolingo as my primary method, which I started about 4-5 mounths ago. I did so because I had prior knowledge of Japanese and German, but wanted to be able to practice speaking with my coworkers, so I started Spanish and Arabic as well. As you can probably guess, I soon found out that it's better to focus on one at a time, however, I don't want to stop learning any of them.

What I've started doing is giving priority to Spanish, as I can practice easily, and that my progress is much faster thanks to it being a romance language. For 20 new words, I generally have only a few that I don't remember right after the lesson, and close to none after getting a skill up to level 5. I will be incorporating more methods to have a variety of Spanish input.

In the meantime, I also practice remembering and writing Kanji and complete Japanese words, for which I use Kanji Tree as well as a homemade spreadsheet.

For German and Arabic, I will just continue doing my Duolingo lessons until I can't progress just from that anymore, and give them a lower priority on days that I feel less motivated.

So it's sort of complicated to put this information in a flashcard so that I can't study it through flashcards. Most of the times, or course, I can perceive the meaning and the main idea of what people are trying to communicate. However, I do not want to have a vague idea of what something means, I would like to understand it as a whole.

languagelearning,What are the best tools to turn words from sentences into something I can understand?,"I run into words in my target language that I don't know yet all the time and I'd like to get them *explained* to me (a translation, definition, image or anything to let me understand the word).

Copying the word into a dictionary or translator often doesn't work because many words in most languages have several different meanings or even composable forms. For example, ""turn"" in ""turn the lights off"" has nothing to do either with *a curve* or with *rotate*, but those are the main results you'd get from dictionaries and translators.

An option is to copy the entire sentence in a good translator, but if the sentence contains multiple words you don't know, or if you don't fully know the grammar it uses, it's going to be really hard to understand what's going on.

I'm looking for a tool that can take in a whole sence and *explain* single words from it. In the example above, I'd like to be informed that ""turn"" in ""turn the lights off"" is part of the phrasal verb ""to turn off"" which means to make the lights go dark.

languagelearning,"Would it be easier to learn a language I’ve heard all my life, pretty much everyday, but don’t speak?","
Question/short explanation: So basically my parents are both from The Gambia, and despite being from different tribes, mainly speak Wolof at home. My problem is that despite hearing it constantly, I really can’t speak it at all. I was born and raised in the US. My parents always spoke English to me and my siblings at home out of fear that teaching us both would “confuse” us. Would it be easier than learning a language that’s totally foreign to me? I took French for 4 years and I still can’t speak it so it kind of worries me. I’m too embarrassed to really immerse myself. I also fear that I would have a strong and noticeable accent.

Long explanation: As a child a I repeatedly asked them to teach me and I would basically get 1 of 3 responses: my dad would ignore me, my mom would laugh and tell me to say some random word(she thought it was funny?? Or maybe she’s just not a good teacher… idk she just never took it seriously) and then there is my least favorite response (also from my mother), who would say that one day she would send us there and I’d pick up on it. This was an acceptable response when I was 7, not so much now that I’m in my late teens and I still haven’t been there.

It’s not like they avoided speaking it to each other or to relatives so I heard it constantly. It really bothers me because it seems like basically all of my cousins and relatives are receptively bilingual at the very least. I am slightly, if I hear a conversation I could probably tell you what the topic is, but that’s it. It becomes more annoying and embarrassing as I get older because people in my community just randomly speak it to me until I reply in English or say that I don’t understand. They always kind of laugh or start talking to me like I’m a kid. It bothers me because I feel so… culturally isolated? Like I don’t have a culture.

I don’t want to ask my parents because my mom couldn’t teach to save her life nor does she think it’s a big enough deal to try. My dad gets mad every time I bring it up. They say they made a mistake and tell me to leave it at that as if it isn’t an ongoing problem for me. Wolof isn’t widely spoken enough to have many online resources.

Sorry this turned into a bit of a rant but the question remains lol.",1628672290,RoseThorne_,66,434,2253,101,19
languagelearning,"Which language should i properly learn first, Spanish or Italian?","I lived in Spain for 2 years as i did my Master's degree, however I was too busy studying and ""living the life"" along with having all English-speaking friends (even the Spanish friends i had) made me just lazy about learning. My spanish is around B1 (maybe lower now as I haven't spoken any or practiced for over a year). 

On the other hand, I have an Italian girlfriend who i plan on proposing to very soon. Her family and friends speak no English (nothing to write home about at least) and therefore communication is and will be very hard, to say the least. 
My Italian is between A1 and A2, just from sponging things up from her, similarities between Spanish and Italian, and what I just guess based on context and memorize. I have never really practiced it or academically studied it like I did Spanish, basically bits of words that I somehow gel into a sentence (with abysmal grammar and structure) that conveys the gist of what I would like to say.

I would love to learn both as I plan on moving to either Spain or Italy once covid subsides or life normalizes a bit. I love both countries equally and finding a job in either requires me to know the language.

languagelearning,Is it normal to burn out and cap out at the more formal part of language learning? I seem to have reached my limit.,"At first, language learning is fun for me because it helps with travel or living in a country, allows me to make more friends, and allows me to enjoy media in that target language. Among languages I've learned, I've gone far enough with Japanese and Korean to be able to consume media, talk casually, and survive on a daily basis while I've learned enough Italian to be of use whenever I travel there. I wouldn't say I speak these languages, but I know enough French and German passively to know what I'm ordering and know what basic place names mean. There was enough sense of reward.

I'm planning on attaining at least level N2 in Japanese for career purposes and I'm studying and taking a class for it but now I'm realizing why it's burning me a lot recently and why I never got past intermediate level with Korean. It's the formal part of language learning where you gotta read, write, and talk about stuff you don't necessarily care about. It's no longer the phase where you can choose which media to consume or phase where you can tailor fit your study plan to fit your needs. It's no longer simply reading an article or watching something casually cause now you gotta be able to write about it formally and understand it in a deep level. You now have to sit through stuff that you don't need or care about. You have to study vocabulary that you're not necessarily going to use. This isn't really an issue with lower levels because the topics and vocabulary isn't as complex but it quickly reaches diminishing returns on higher levels.

It's an inevitable phase that I just don't think I have the willpower to push through since I'm not feeling the sense of reward anymore. I wouldn't feel this way if this was an immediate need like say if my job consists of writing formal reports in Japanese then the sense of need will kick in and I wouldn't feel like I'm just dragging my feet through the mud. I thought I can get around this or at least minimize the drag by exposure to a lot of media I care about (like maybe if I read enough light novels in raw Japanese it should be easier for me to understand and write about more formal articles) but nope. I get that when we were learning our native language in school, we had to go through the same formal phase of learning more formal vocabulary, reading and writing about stuff we don't necessarily care about, etc. but our native language is something that's essential in our daily life and survival and it's not something you can just run away from so there's at least meaning in the formal phase. 

How would you go about this? While I can't deny that I need a break, that's not going to make the path of formal phase any less of a drag.",1628660639,InsomniaEmperor,1,496,2695,115,24

I supplement my studies with a lot of anime, manga, light novels, random news articles, etc. I get that anime and manga have more casual speech, light novels use more formal vocabulary and grammar, and full blown novels, newspapers, essays, etc. use much more formal language. Now the big dilemma is, a lot of the N2 level vocabulary don't appear in the stuff I read or watch. They're essentially stuck in Anki hell where I just don't encounter them outside my Anki reviews or looking up sample sentences where those words are used. Meanwhile, the vocabulary I commonly encounter in exposure seems far more useful yet not really that helpful when taking practice tests or the like.

How do you go about this? The big frustration for me when I took N2 2 years ago was that there's just a ton of vocabulary I just don't know. I have to have a huge arsenal of vocabulary just to pass the test so it's incredibly tempting to put them in Anki because I just absolutely have to know these vocabulary. Of course that alone isn't enough so I supplement it with exposure to actual material but again, the issue is when there's a large difference in vocabulary for both cases. Had the same issue with Korean too where the vocabulary I encounter in tv, radio, music, etc. is vastly different from vocabulary for higher level proficiency tests. This might not be an issue in lower levels where basic vocabulary can be more easily found. I can't help but feel like focusing heavily more on exposure is more productive than focusing on the test material.",1628497807,InsomniaEmperor,9,293,1659,149,24

languagelearning,Apps &amp; Services that offer lifetime membership for multiple languages,"I know this isn't an ""app shopping"" reddit, but in reality it seems that we end up looking for and going through various different apps and websites/services throughout our language learning journeys (which is also helpful and fun in itself).

Especially once you fall in love with learning a foreign language, i think many of us start looking for another language or culture/country we're interested in and would like to keep going if possible (hence there, one of the practical constraints become the money you need to pay for each language app/lesson series per month or year). 

So i thought it could be a good idea to have some idea about which apps offer multiple languages with lifetime subscription options. Granted, ""lifetime sub"" isn't as useful when you're only learning one language, since for most services, we'd rather want to go beyond what the app can help us with (at least at this point in technology). But i think it does have good value once you use the app for other languages too, even if it wouldn't take you  further than intermediate level.

I'd like to have some list of such apps for my own future use, and thought it can also be helpful for some other people, especially if you like it as a life-long hobby.

I'll start with some i've found so far as i tried or checked out other apps, and i hope some people could add more to the list. I won't write down how much each service is, since those numbers can change with time and region. I think we can probably find good deals during times like Black Friday sales once we know which apps offer subs we're interested in.

So here are some i've found:

\- Babbel (multiple language sub available at higher price than single language option). If i may add a little description, i think this one is good for beginning and having a solid grasp/understanding of a new language. I've used it for a less popular language (not FIGS), and appreciated what it does, but didn't seem to help that much beyond that level. Perhaps some people who've used this one for the popular languages can chime in and let people know if it's also good for higher levels.

\- Clozemaster.    (Sidenote: Lifetime sub price seems to be a bit over twice the annual sub and seems to be the case for most other services also)

\- Speakly   (doesn't support many languages, at least not yet. Has some interesting offers like Finnish and even Estonian though if you're so inclined)

\- Drops  (personally found this one really fun to use in spare times, and not stressful while learning new words in a way that sticks. However, i'm not sure if subscribing is really necessary for this app yet. Might be worth it at advanced level)

\- Memrise (This is a big one that i'm yet to try. Would like to hear if this is really worth the money and time)

\- Busuu (another big one i haven't really tried. Would love to hear some opinions as well, especially if you've tried lifetime sub)

\- Pimsleur (lol..  j/k  'lifetime option' is indeed there)

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's all i know of. Apps aside, i think Youtube and Anki (depending on people) are really, really helpful and not to be neglected. Youtube, i think, becomes much more helpful once you're at an intermediate level or above (aside from some free beginners' lessons).

languagelearning,Studying Several Languages at Once: The Pros and Cons,"I know the community is divided on this topic, but it's a question that pops up so frequently here that I want to share my personal experiences with learning several languages at once:

The Pros:

\-&gt; I don't have to decide which language to focus on first.

\-&gt; Since I'm at various levels in my languages, I can adapt my studying to my current level of focus and energy (e.g. watching something in French, where I'm already C1+ in listening comprehension, is much easier than working through a textbook chapter of an A1 language where most of the stuff is still new and possibly confusing).

\-&gt; If I need a break from one language, I can just switch to another one for the moment and still continue studying.

\-&gt; Cross-linguistic reference, e.g. comparing similarities and differences in grammar aspects or ways to express something, can actually reinforce learning them in both compared languages. 

\-&gt; I love learning about how different languages work, so learning several at the same time satisfies this curiosity way better than learning them one after the other would.

\-&gt; Learning more than one language at a time feels natural and like nothing special to me since it is expected from German students in school and I grew up with it being normal.

The Cons:

\-&gt; Progress in each individual language is slower (assuming you compare spending the same amount of time on one language versus on several languages). Take Icelandic, for example: I started it about a year ago and am still somewhere around A1, I'd say (except for reading comprehension, which is probably at A2+ by now). Had I spent the entire amount of time focusing only on Icelandic, I'm sure I'd be at a solid B1 by now instead.

\-&gt; Interference. This isn't unique to learning several languages at once; in fact, some amount of interference is normal as soon as you start learning a second language (whether it's more than one native language, or starting your first foreign language). But it's probably more noticeable if you switch between languages for a long time while studying, especially if two or more languages you're studying are very similar to each other (say, Romance languages, or Dutch and German). Be prepared that, while your INPUT usually benefits from the similarities, your OUTPUT will likely have a lot of interference at first and it can take quite a while for your head to sort them apart, and potentially require a lot of effort on your part. So if you have some important event in one language coming up, say, an exam, consider taking a break from the other, interfering language(s) for a little while beforehand.

\-&gt; Choice paralysis. Sometimes, when I want to start studying, I can't decide what exactly to do because there are too many tempting choices...

\-&gt; Use it or lose it, meaning you need to use all your languages kind of regularly (the amount and time frame may vary from person to person) or some of your progress will get lost (mostly active skills in my experience, while passive skills, in my case, stayed mostly intact even after a ten-year break for some low intermediate to low advanced languages). So naturally, the more languages you are learning/have already learned, the more time you need to spend in order to prevent losing them. This, again, isn't unique to learning more than one language at a time, but lower-level languages get lost faster than higher-level languages.

I invite civil discussion and am actually interested in hearing other people's experiences, but please refrain from claiming that ""it's not possible to learn more than one language at a time"" since I've been doing exactly that for over two decades now, and there's tons of people around the world successfully doing the same.",1628385781,Miro_the_Dragon,33,635,3759,53,9

They also served tasty but spicy hot dogs!  I really like the sound of the language and Hungarian people are super supportive of foreigners learning their language!

French speakers like to pronounce words in strange ways. For example, they often say **pt'être** instead of **peut être.** You would have a hard time recognising it if you never heard it spoken like that before!

We're doing an academic research study on language learning algorithms. This app helps you actively practice your listening skills from native speaker videos. The goal is to help bridge the gap between what you study and the 'real world'.

Instead of passively watching YouTube videos, the app asks you questions that force you to pay attention. That way you learn better! Each question consists of a short video clip. You have to select the right option that corresponds to the missing word, by paying attention to what the person says.

Does trying to speak freely with a native early in the language learning journey, let’s say by A2 level, affect negatively the speaking skill by creating early wrong patterns that would be hard to get rid of even when you reach an advanced level? Or does the speaking skill improve over time as you learn actively the language and practice free speaking regardless of the mistakes you make early in the process. 

In my case, I started practicing speaking somewhere in A2, then continued doing so for around a year now. My level at the moment is mid B2. Of course my speaking skill has improved enormously since I have first started. However, I still make mistakes while speaking especially when it comes to gender and grammar but  the difference now is that more comfortable, can effectively deliver the message, and use wide range of vocabularies. My concern is that if I continue practice speaking (around 3-4 hours a week) I might reach a level where I’m too comfortable and stop trying to speak correctly and the mistakes I usually make become a habit.

I'm a Ukrainian student now, and I have been learning English almost all my life, but to be honest my skills are pretty low anyway. I learned it in the school well, but not more than it was required. I think the reason is that... I HATE English. I hate the fact that I need to learn it, but still.. I actually need to.
I want to break this walls I built around myself. I want to break myself and love this effing language cause I can't live on like this.
Today I want to ask for your guys help. My English teacher in university gave us an optional task: to translate a book. It should be not very big, like 100-300 pages, as he said. I totally ignored this all the academic year, but now I'm feel like really motivated to do so. I'll force myself to do this. I even think now about writing something in English by myself, but translating book first.
Could you guys please advise me some fiction book that won't be too difficult to understand (for me as a Ukrainian) and not very big as I already said? Let me explain: I had translated a couple of books a few years ago, but it was a really old XIX century literature so I didn't stand it after ten pages. One more book I tried to translate was a ""bestseller"" by some psychologist, it was kinda about family sth like that, and it consisted of VERY long and complicated sentences. Even my elder bro who is really cool in Eng was pop-eyed with that book. Oh and I translated a couple of stories by Isaac Asimov, and it was not bad, but it was distopia about distant future, I guess it's not that genre that I like. So about a literature style.. I will be very glad to read n translate something like Jack London stories, although I don't know how difficult he's style in original is. Or something like Alexander Green stories, but he already was writing in russian hehe.
It will be great you to share your experiences in translating English books by yourselves (especially if you are slav like me).

I guess I'm asking because I'm curious to know what's holding most people back from going all the way. Generally speaking, it seems like the entire 'accent debate' can be broken down into 3 groups.

1. Those who really want a native-like accent, but recognize that it's extremely difficult (perhaps even impossible), and learn to accept that having a foreign accent is okay.
2. Those who, even if given the chance, wouldn't want a native accent because they see it as an identify issue. ""Why would I want to sound like a native Korean if I'm a Swede, born and raised in Sweden? It's like pretending to be someone I'm not"". 
3. Those who genuinely like their foreign accent because they think it sounds cool and/or sometimes even cute/sexy to the opposite gender.

languagelearning,Need Help With Listening Skills,"I've been studying Russian for a while now and I still have trouble understanding things that are spoken. I have hypothesized that the reason for the lack of understanding is not vocab but the cohesion of certain sentences, for example ""Как Получится"" from my understanding is ""it depends"", however the translation for как is ""how"" and ""gonna work"" is from Получится. Do I have to study sets of words to understand the meaning? Keep in mind, if I listen to a podcast or something and hear ""Как Получится"" I'm instantly going to try and translate it into English in my head, which would probably take a second or two, but then it wouldn't make sense so I would have to do a double take and remember that this set of words means (Fill in blank). Trying to remember just these two words would take like 4 seconds and by that point the podcast/TV would have said another 10 words by that point. People also say that they've learned a language just by watching YouTube videos and studying some grammar. How does everyone translate a language in your mind? When you hear a word do you automatically visualize it and know what it is in a second? My Russian speaking skills are far better then my listening skills, this is a problem because I can't really use my speaking skills if I don't understand and can't have a conversation. I guess overall I would like to know how you all translate words so fast in a face to face conversation, what listening exercises best worked for you and if anybody else has had trouble like this and found some information that turned it around.

languagelearning,"Has anyone successful learned a ""heritage language"" to an advanced level (C1/C2), what have your experiences been like?","So I grew up completely in Australia but I have an Indonesian background. Since I was not formally educated in Indonesia and really put no effort speaking the language from ages 5 until 17ish my formal Indonesian was almost non-existant until I started learning myself. I started learning Indonesian really lazily 4 years ago but have been going hard this year. I don't know where I am now but I definitely should be at a high level according to the teacher of an Advanced Indonesian class I took in uni one time, I don't think I'm a C2 yet though.

So far, it's a bit frustrating that I can't prove to people I can speak in Indonesian. Whenever I speak with my parents they always say things like ""you probably dont know this word"" or they think everytime I misunderstand a convo, it's because of my Indonesian skills, which is annoying because I tend to take a while to understand things regardless of language lmao.

Whenever I speak to new people, they always ask me if I know this saying despite already speaking native-level Indonesian to everyone else. Most of the new and sophisticated Indonesian words I've learned are also formal words that I can never showcase in front of anyone. So despite putting a bunch of effort into learning Indonesian, I'll still be always put in the category of kid who grew up in Australia that only knows a smidge of Indonesian.

I know language learning should be an individual thing but sometimes you just feel like you want to prove that you've been improving in a certain language and especially in your heritage language. Overall though, it's been an enjoyable experience",1628240502,bobbygil,8,283,1615,119,18

So essentially  i'll be doing a University Bachelors Degree without a lecturer (thankfully friends and the German reddit can help me).

languagelearning,How much should I know in a specific language before teaching English to speakers of that languages?,"Hello,

I'm thinking of starting a YouTube channel teaching English to people who speak Spanish and Portuguese. I speak English natively and have practiced Spanish and Portuguese for a couple of years, although I don't speak any of them natively. I would say I'm probably B2/C1 (in the CEFR scale) in both of the languages. Maybe a little more towards C1 in Spanish and a little more towards B2 in Portuguese.

So my question, since I know that a lot of you are very knowledgeable about languages, is therefore if you'd say (based on the information I wrote) I know enough Spanish/Portuguese to teach English to people. Or should I wait until I'm at a higher level in Spanish and Portuguese before starting the YouTube channel?",1628213691,Iverseeno,5,126,727,100,17
languagelearning,Why is it that Romance languages are less difficult for native English speakers to learn than German?,"I've taken both German and Spanish classes before. My first was German, for around 5 years. 

I found German pronunciation a lot easier to pick up than Spanish. Sounds like /x/ came easier to me than most because I focus on pronunciation a lot. Once /x/ was down it was relatively easy to learn /ʀ/. The umlaut vowels were all taught to us in the span of several days and we had learned them pretty quickly. 

Being able to do a German trill helped a lot with picking up Spanish /r/, but even then it took a lot of practice. It's still difficult for me to articulate it quickly in when it comes after certain sounds. I find Spanish orthography more inconsistent than German- labials change depending on the letters around which can be confusing. Another problem for me was Spanish g, which often confuses me whether or not I should see it as a silent letter or as an /x/. 

But for some reason, Spanish grammar is a lot more penetratble for me than German ever was. One less gender to worry about meant that there were tons of conjugations I don't need to learn. There are only four versions of the word ""the,"" adjectives only get conjugated for gender/number, and as far as I know weird word order changes/variability are less common in Spanish. 

I know that German vocabulary is supposed to be more recognizable for English speakers, but I think that Spanish vocab was easier to learn. 

I wonder why German grammar is more difficult than German. I've heard that, since German and English are more closely related, their grammar should be similar. Actually learning German, though, grammar was often super strange and seemed alien to me. This was a lot less common doing Spanish. 

So, German learners, what do you think about this? Do you also find the grammar frusturating? What issues did you run into? 

Spanish learners, do you agree with me that Spanish is an easier language to pick up? Am I too early in the learning process to make a judgement like that? What problems did you have to overcome with Spanish?",1628212772,synthpop1917,23,359,2019,101,17

languagelearning,"In your apps, do you guys like global settings, or per quiz settings?","Hi! We're a language learning application team (mostly for Chinese for right now, but potentially for other languages later)

We're hard at work building features for our beta launch, and we wanted to get some input from the language learning community.

We've got a few quizzes created for the app (and a statistics page to analyze them, which we may split off to another page):

https://imgur.com/a/p52JHek

We want to have several configuration options for tests (for example, letting you choose between your own list of words, an skill level (HSK/A/B/C levels etc), and just going wild and getting random words from the dictionary)

Some of these test options could be global per test - for example, if you choose skill level 3 words, we could make it so that all tests that can work off a list switch to skill level 3. That would mean less work for you.

Alternatively, you might not want that - for example let's say you're really good with the matching game, but you have a lot of trouble with multiple choice. You may want to switch to skill level 3 words for the matching game, but leave them on skill level 2 with multiple choice.

So what do you like better? More granularity, or greater ease? Or do you want us to try to figure out a way to let you do both (which may make the app more complex to learn how to use)?

We're really trying to get community feedback now that we're starting to prepare for a semi-public beta, so any feedback is super helpful!

languagelearning,Approaching languages with way less cognates,"Hi. I'm interested in hearing about any tips you guys have for languages that are linguistically a bit less related to English and therefore are harder to learn simply through input and immersion.

When I would read in French and Portuguese I never noticed how many words I would pick up just by seeing them a couple times; I didn't even need to look them up - words like *confortável, punível,* or *conteúdo,* that either looked like an English word or shared some sort of root or base with an English word.

However, when I was studying Hungarian and dabbling in some Slavic languages, I felt like I would try to read and pick up a few words just through context or repeated input or something, but the messages just never made it into my head. Obviously I know not to get too hung up over words that I don't know, so I usually just move on and try the next sentence, which leads to the same result. I felt like I was putting in double the mental effort and getting less than half of the reward.

Any thoughts on this issue? Is there any other way to get over this problem without having to look up every single word in a dictionary?

languagelearning,Olly Richards Short Stories in Icelandic--Review,"The book (I used the Kindle ebook) contains eight short stories that greatly differ in topic and setting (and some are written in the present while others use past). It claims to be at CEFR level A2-B1. Each story is divided into three or four chapters, with each chapter being followed by a brief summary and comprehension questions (all in Icelandic), as well as the vocabulary deemed too difficult (typically about a Kindle page full, translations given in English). Each story is also preceeded by a full-page illustration setting the tone for the coming story. On my Kindle app (on smartphone), each story contained about 25-30 pages of text. I needed about 60-90 minutes per story.

What I liked:

\-&gt; the stories, albeit written in simple language for learners, were actually quite entertaining, some more, some less

\-&gt; the Kindle app makes it very easy to look up words and whole phrases (the translator--needs internet connection--is hit or miss for individual words but was fairly good for longer phrases), which is  a HUGE help for a particle-verb-heavy language like Icelandic (you can know every single word in a sentence and still have no clue what the heck it means...)

\-&gt; the variety in topics and settings exposed me to a greater variety of vocabulary

\-&gt; the language was descriptive enough that I was able to ""see"" the stories in my head, aka create mental images of the scene and people

\-&gt; I liked having both stories written in the present and stories written in the past to get accustomed to both narration styles/verb tenses associated with it

What I didn't like:

\-&gt; I would have liked the answers to the comprehension questions following the questions and not being bundled in the back of the book

\-&gt; (this one's probably totally on me, not on the book!) the selection of given vocabulary help was sometimes a bit strange as I ended up looking up a lot of other words but knew quite a few of those he gave translations for

\-&gt; even after finishing, I'm still not sure whether the stories were sorted in increasing difficulty or were totally random...

What level do I think my reading comprehension is now?

Definitely NOT B1! I had to look up far too many words and sometimes whole phrases to say that I was comfortably able to read the stories. I would say, though, that it's probably A2+ by now as there were also a lot of parts I could read quite fluently (especially towards the end of the book), or words/phrases I looked up only to get confirmation that I guessed correctly.

Summary:

I can definitely recommend this reader. One big warning for those learning more than one TL, though: I was considering getting one of his other readers as well, only to realise that, based on the titles, the other book contains the EXACT SAME STORIES. Which...I mean, the stories were entertaining enough to enjoy my read-through but not good enough that I'd want to read them several times over in different languages...",1628120489,Miro_the_Dragon,6,511,2975,48,6

I'll also have to start with basics in the said college courses because they don't accept students like me who ,,self-studied their way through basics and claim to be at A2” so there's no way they'll let me skip the certificate level and take admission in the Diploma course instead.

languagelearning,Goodreads for language learners - suggestions and feedback on comprehensible input finding concept appreciated,"As an intermediate language learner, I often find it difficult to find longer-form native content that I can read at an extensive or intensive level. Children's novels are frequently topic-specific and I'm well past the graded readers.

This leaves me sifting through tens of downloaded webnovels and running them through some of my analysis programs - and even then, I've had to drop books a few times, whether out of boredom or difficulty.

So, I've been thinking of coding up an app/site to help address this issue - somewhat similar to Goodreads, but with more features targeted for language learners. Before I dive into making it, however, I'd really appreciate any feedback or suggestions so it can be the best tool possible! Also hoping to clarify what feature path would be the most useful for the community.

One approach I thought of would be to have a Goodreads-esque community where language learners can post books they've read, along with reviews and ratings. There would be a number of ways to assess the book in order to build up a useful profile for it - such as its CEFR difficulty, length, how gripping the storyline was, lexical richness, etc. This could potentially be extended to shows, native websites, and so on. The tool would then suggest books for users based off of their library. However, the pitfall I see here is that of community engagement and size - is this something you think you would use? A very sizable userbase would be needed to make the concept work.

On the other hand, I'm considering doing the same as the above but on a larger scale by keeping track of the raw text of audiovisual resources. The rating system would be the same, but texts for the books, articles, shows' subtitles, etc. would be stored by the system. By allowing users to input their known vocabulary (through flashcard imports, based off an online test, their previously read books...) this could be compared to the books' text, augmented by the rating system, to create a readily available list of native resources at the right level, and even build up a 'map' of sorts that would suggest progressively more challenging content.

I'm most excited about this second route and would love to build it, but am just worried about legal or content issues not being a lawyer; while there are a decent number of free, copyright-free books on the web, they're often difficult, old, or frankly boring. This approach would work slightly better with articles or shows since the text is available freely, but books are the best medium due to their length and popularity. While, at least for Chinese, there are sites which have existed for years hosting thousands of books, I'm not sure if I could run into trouble linking to those or storing book text files for analysis - even if just for internal use, having users buy the content themselves. Unfortunately but unsurprisingly, e-book selling platforms don't seem to offer the option to access book data.

What do you think of this sort of language-learning tool? Any thoughts on useful features or ways to create a large library of accessible content without licensing issues that could bring the site crashing down? I'm hoping to be able to create something that will benefit learners like me, so any and all feedback, suggestions, criticisms would be greatly appreciated.",1628060341,LAcuber,6,566,3327,110,14

French is also more profitable, both in my country and as a language of countries I might want emigrate to.

languagelearning,"Recommendation for German youtubers, shows, podcasts etc.","Hello! I recently did a language test and discovered that I'm still at a B2 level in German, despite the fact that I have studied it throughout my whole education (from Kindergarten to master's degree). I'm good at writing and reading, and decent at comprehension, but my speaking skills are terrible. Although I studied German for so long, I had my first conversation with a native speaker last year and it didn't go so well. At this point I think that I need to immerse myself more into native speakers' speech, since it always lacked at school/university, and youtube or podcasts seems like the best option.

So, do you have links to nice natural German resources? Not necessarily language related, in fact I'd prefer if it wasn't something like ""let's learn German"" because I need to expand my vocab and really get into the native mindset. Thanks!",1628007979,kimsherd,8,147,851,57,7

languagelearning,How do you feel about forced output? Is it effective?,"One thing that's bothering me about my current Japanese class is there's a bit too much output in what the teacher has us do everyday and in the homework everyday and not really enough input in the way of reading or listening. Here's what the teacher asks us to do when we go through new vocabulary words.

1) Provide a Japanese definition of that word.

2) Use that word in a sentence.

If I'm learning a word for the first time then I wouldn't know what it means, much less provide a definition of it in Japanese or even use it in a sentence. Even if the teacher does tell you what it means, that's still not enough info to be able to properly use it in a sentence.

Another thing that bothers me and why it comes off as forced output for me is the homework everyday where it's either we write about something or make a presentation on it. That something is always some random topic the teacher decides and a topic that I don't even talk about in my native language. Perhaps I just don't like writing but it just feels forced because I just don't write or speak in my target language unless absolutely needed. Is this normal? I improved in Korean considerably when I was in Korea because I had to talk in Korean on a regular basis and I don't remember being forced to talk about a random topic I don't even talk about in my native language. I can't seem to replicate the same effect in Japanese since it's not a language I need to use in my everyday life outside of class. 

I've seen tips like writing a diary in your target language or translating your thoughts into your target language but what if you just don't write a diary even in your native language? Can you really force output like this? I know you can't get better at writing or speaking without doing them but I'm having a hard time forcing myself to do those. I'm just at my breaking point now and this forced writing and speaking the teacher has us do every day is starting to kill my enjoyment in language learning.",1627999920,InsomniaEmperor,7,373,1984,53,10
languagelearning,THE ONLY LANGUAGE WITH...,"I live in this region [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/EqHA5DYH9ssg3pTc6) in the Philippines which is called the Bicol Region were the Bicolano language is dominantly spoken among the 150+ languages of the Philippines. 

Bikol, is an Austronesian language spoken by the Bicolanos (~2 Million speakers), primarily in the Bicol Region of southern Luzon, Philippines. Bikol also has a rich set of discourse particles, which can be hard to translate in Filipino (Tagalog).

But let's get to the gist of it. The Bicolano language is the only language with ""angry registers."" Present in all the dialects of the Bicol language, the angry register stems from the strong positive or negative emotions of the interlocutors, and, hence, meaning is perceptual, specifically aural, rather than morphologic. The angry register is unique to Bicol languages as it cannot be found in other Austronesian Languages inside and outside the Philippines. It is generally used only among same-age speakers or by older speakers to younger listeners, as usage by younger speakers in addressing their elders would constitute great disrespect. On occasion, the angry register is used in sarcasm or humor, but the majority of its usage is in anger. Rinconada Bikol has contributed much to this unique feature.

To dumb it down, it means we have another existing words to certain words to constitute and express anger which certain nouns, adjectives, and verbs are replaced when the speaker is angry. 

Example of words and phrases:

Eyes
(Use your eyes)
Normal - Gamiton mo ang MATA mo!
Angry - Gamiton mo ang MALSOK mo!

Cat
(Whose cat is this?)
Normal - Kay sisay na IKOS ini?
Angry - Kay sisay na KURASMAG ini?

Woman
(Where is that woman?)
Normal - Hain/yain na daw an na BABAYI na an?
Angry - Hain/yain na daw an na BABAKNIT na an?

Mouth
(Watch your mouth!)
Normal - Iling-ilingon mo ang NGIMOT mo
Angry - Iling-ilingon mo ang NGISLO mo!

Dog
(Whose dog is this?)
Normal - Kay sisay na AYAM ini?
Angry - Kay sisay na GAMADYA ini?

Asleep
(Are you still asleep?)
Normal - TUROG ka pa nanggad?
Angry - KATIPLA ka pa nanggad?

Hand
(I'll break your hand!)
Normal - Lapuon ko an na KAMOT mo
Angry - Lapuon ko an na KAMULMOG mo

Feet
(Your feet are dirty)
Normal - Maation ang mga BITIS mo
Angry - Maation ang SAMINGKIL mo!

It's worth noting that other terms also exist in different places, but I mainly used above what is being utilized in our place.

As can be observed, the angry register forms are not generally predictable from the normal register forms, although there may at times be a slight resemblance between the two. Indeed, they would be incomprehensible to a non-native speaker who had only learned the normal register of the language. 

So yeah, I feel like I didn't explain it well to you all, but if you are interested and want to dive deep in the topic you can always search the angry register of the Bikol/Bicol language on Google. I'm happy that I've got to share what's unique about my native language and I've only appreciated it when I only dived into the world of language learning, and I'm proud I've got to share my first post here as a long-time lurker.

languagelearning,Help with learning my native tongue,"
TL;WR I want to learn my native tongue so my family had the idea of only speaking to me in it but im wondering if it will work.

Hi,

I'm a 14 y/o student in the UK going into yr 10, and I'm from Botswana, in Africa.

For the entirety of my life so far i've been able to understand the language but never speak it back, although I've tried, and have been meaning to learn it for a while now.

The reason I didn't learn my  native language is because when I was entering pre-school at home in botswana my parents would speak to me in setswana but my school didn't, and so i lagged behind everyone else at school and wasnt able to speak, and so my school thought that being spoken to in 2 different languages confused me as to how to speak it (which is complete BS,  i think i was just really quiet.)

This isnt really an issue, as both of my parents are fluent in English, but I just want to be able to speak to them in their native tongue/ speak to my grandparents and extended family.

I raised these concerns with my mum, and she and I came to the conclusion that if I was completely immersed in Setswana at home, I'd be forced to recover my ability to speak it (I used to be able to speak more setswana than English) and so we've been trying that, although we keep forgetting about this agreement so i havent learnt much.
My father also thinks I should learn Setswana.

So, my question is, will this actually work out and make me learn Setswana, or will I be wasting my time?
I also have severe ADHD, which might explain why i was slow learning the language, and keep that in mind when writing any solutions. Thanks!",1627993310,moffrow-am,4,312,1620,35,6

languagelearning,HOW I ORGANIZE MY LANGUAGE LEARNING STUDIES!,"So I know that alot of people spends tons and tons of time making the perfect language learning schedule and tge perfect language learning notebook etc. 
so I decided I would show you how my setup looks like.
❌Spoiler Alert: it’s not perfect❌
So I started off with making a folder for language learning in my notes app
and just called it “📚language learning”. Then inside that folder I made another folder for the language I’m learning so it became 
“🇭🇷croatian”, now if you’re learning multiple languages you can add multiple folders, just make sure you have a folder for each language. Now inside that Croatian folder I make two folders, “📒learning” and “📚pre-planning” in my pre-planning folder I made another folder called “📒notebook setup” 
Now I will show you how I organized each folder:

PRE-PLANNING:
In my pre-planning folder I have another folder called Notebook setup(down below) I also just write things that I need to remember before I have actually started studying.

NOTEBOOK SETUP:
In this folder I made 1 note for each of my notebooks, right now I am using 4 notebooks, one for journaling, one for vocabulary, one for my goals and one for everything else.
The setups are pretty simple: I have 4 pages with table of contents then I just have everything else that I want to write.

Then in the goals notebook I don’t have a table of Contents I just write my 2021 goals on one page then my August goals on another and my weekly goals on the other etc.

LEARNING:
In the 📒learning folder I just put things like recordings for when I record myself talking or reading. I also put things like my Resources or my Monthly reviews in that folder. I think it’s good to ask yourself questions like:
What went good? 
What went bad?
Was there balance between the 5 skills?(reading, listening, writing, speaking and culture)
Is there something you need to change during next month?
So ask yourself all of these questions at the end of every month.

STUDY SCHEDULE:
For my study schedule I just use a whiteboard that I have on my door, I make the schedule based of my weekly and monthly goals. For example:
MONTHLY:
- I want to learn more food vocabulary
Then on my schedule I would write:
- learn some basic foods

&amp;#x200B;

I've genuinely impressed this scene. I could have a motivation to learn English from the British accent. As a Korean, our education system just stuck with together American accent. As you know, if something repeat enormously, I make someone sick. Additionally, the judgement about every pronunciation is horrible. I have no opportunity to speak the English language.

&amp;#x200B;

But my first trip to the UK changed all my perspectives. And now I'm released from the obsessions.

Now I think, I wish, and many people want to learn a language in a way of that we already had at the time we were learnt our mother tongue in our childhood. Just listening and mimicking the sounds.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm making an app for language learning alone. But only in a 'listen and speaking' way. I don't know all the alphabet and basic words in French, German, Russian. But I like all the way of making sounds in their languages. So, in a meantime, I'm practising several languages.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I want to release as many people I can, from a bunch of books and an effort about grammar and vocabulary list.

Nearly 97% of Korean just stuck with book and I could see many foreign people who want to learn Korean but in the same way.

I thought, there is a specific problem. The actual speaking in face-to-face takes a lot of money.

I however also adored Japan for years and recently also the Spanish-speaking world and more recently South Korea. I also enjoy a challenge and growth for me is important so if I can learn a language that changes the way that I perceive the world or life, then that would be really interesting too.

My level of English is upper-intermediate (B2/C1). 

I have noticed that I am able to read newspapers or books without any major issue. I understand the vast majority of the vocabulary.

My problem is that when I speak in English, I do not use all the words that I know, but I tend to use the usual basic words or circumlocutions instead of some adjectives. This is an issue that I don't have when I have to write, since I have more time to reflect on the right word to pick.

Do you have any recommendations for me?  How can I actually use in my daily use words that I have already learned in the past

So i really love the Russian language and I started learning intensively something like a week ago, I made good progress but I find no one to talk to in tandem because they either don't answer, dissapear suddenly or only want to talk in English or French and never actually help me with Russian so I barely practice, I tried watching youtube, reading, listenning to songs and some other ressources but even if I build a good vocabulary I just don't know where to begin and I'm completely lost with the particularities of Russian and the amount of ressources available (and because I speak French and English I have even more ressources available).

I should also mention that I never was a fan of grammar (I learned to speak English quite well and I don't even know the difference between the present simple and the present perfect) therefore even if I study grammar I don't remember it as well as if I was just talking to someone

languagelearning,"Cantonese is linguistically a Language, but politically a Dialect.","Cantonese is linguistically a Language.

First, Cantonese is not mutually intelligible with Mandarin, native Chinese people cannot understand Cantonese (though Hong Kong people can understand Mandarin because there are Mandarin classes in Hong Kong's primary school), the mutual intelligibility between Cantonese and Mandarin is arguably less than the mutual intelligibility between Danish, Swedish and Norwegian.

Second , Cantonese and Mandarin have different grammar rules, for Cantonese, it is 我高過你(I higher than you), for Mandarin, it is 我比你高(I than you higher).

The Third one is less-known, Cantonese actually has its own written system that is different from the Mandarin one, Cantonese words such as 嘅、啲、喺、係、俾 are used very seldom in Mandarin, and some Cantonese phrases are used in Mandarin but have different meaning in Mandarin such as 犀利、得意、宜家、隔離, the most highlighted example recently is that quarantine in Chinese (隔離) has one meaning in Mandarin (Quarantine) but two meanings in Cantonese (Quarantine and Nearby), if a native Chinese go a walk on Hong Kong forums (like LIHKG or HK Discuss), they will not be able to read and understand the articles and comments because there are many Cantonese words and slangs that are not used or different in Mandarin.

Forth, the most obvious one, Cantonese and Mandarin have different pronunciation, Cantonese has 6 tones with 3 ending tones (k,t,p) while Mandarin has 4 tones with 1 soft tone, some Chinese words have the same pronunciations in both Cantonese and Mandarin (such as 馬 maa/ma) but some other Chinese words have totally different pronunciations in both Cantonese and Mandarin (such as 香 hoeng/xiang).

However, due to Hong Kong's political situation (being a Special Administrative Region under the People's Republic of China), Hong Kong is not a country but a part of the Greater China Region, under the nationalism of the Chinese Communist Party, Cantonese is considered a dialect of Chinese despite being very different with Mandarin, maybe one day Cantonese will be widely recognized as a language instead of a dialect, who knows?",1627887099,LoveEverywhere_hk,21,330,2105,66,9

Watch streamers in your target language, this has been by far the most beneficial thing I have ever done for my German. I've actually started noticing the effects as well, i've started to have thoughts in German, I feel I can naturally kind of speak (based on me now having thoughts in German) despite doing 0 speaking practice.

Watching streamers is basically full immersion and I know everyone hates the pseudo-relationship people form with streamers but actually do it for the sake of your language, type in chat to respond to whatever they're doing etc. 

A few tips, actively listen; watch what they're doing so you can associate the audio with the image - just like how a child learns via Dora the explorer etc. Make flash cards; I take sentences people write in chat and I copy them into anki to learn and experiment with E.g one that might be helpful once I move to Germany is ""Du hast meinen Namen sogar richtig ausgesprochen"". People type helpful sentences in chat all the time, so copy them!

languagelearning,Spanish or French first?,"Hi, I am currently struggling with whether I should pursue learning Spanish or French first. I am in the USA. I am taking community college classes and plan on transferring elsewhere in a year or so, which require language courses from my current school. Whatever I choose will be my first formal foray into learning a language, besides the bits of Swedish I have picked up through the years as my mom and sister are both fluent, active speakers. 

I feel more excited about the possibility of learning French, as I have always been drawn to France and its culture, history, and music. I also have family and family friends in France and Switzerland who I would love to visit, and it would be wonderful to be able to speak in French with them and their children. My sister also speaks French, so I could possibly practice with her.

On the other hand, I think Spanish would be more useful for me. There are more and more Spanish speakers in the US, and in my community there are a lot of farmhands and domestic workers that speak Spanish exclusively. I am studying sociology at the moment, but I hope to eventually have a career that enables me to help communities such as the incarcerated, homeless, and disabled. Possibly law or some kind of social work? My parents greatly want me to be a lawyer, and they are encouraging me to do Spanish as they believe it would be more helpful in that field. 

For my situation, which do you think I should learn first? I feel more drawn to choosing French, but my parents are probably correct that Spanish would be more useful for both my location (USA) and my career hopes. I would appreciate any thoughts ❤️",1627843882,cloudyside,6,298,1649,24,4
languagelearning,Has anyone had luck finding language partners in person?,"I have spoken one foreign language (Spanish) at a reasonably high level for a long time, since high school. I learned it without really having a reason to. I just thought it would be cool to speak another language, and the culture, history, and art of Latin America were interesting to me. It wound up being one of the most enriching experiences of my life -- I discovered tons of literature and music that would become some of my favorite things, made great friends I otherwise would not have, gained a new perspective on the world, etc. I'm sure the members of this sub know what I'm talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a vague desire to learn a third language for a while now, but my life and motivations are a lot different. I have a full time job and can't study for hours at a time like I did as a teenager. I also can't force myself to go through mountains of dry reading material or watch movies and shows I'm only half-interested in solely because *they're in my target language*. I know how much effort it takes just to maintain my Spanish, find interesting content and reading to improve my vocabulary, and so on, and don't really have the time or the motivation to do that with another language.

&amp;#x200B;

What really motivates me is people. When I started Spanish I was primarily focused on being able to read/understand, but later found that having real-life conversations with people was far and away the most rewarding part of it.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, it seems like all language interchanges these days are online. Nothing wrong with that, and understandably it's a lot easier to find people to speak with when *the entire world* is your pool, but I really just have no desire to talk over video chat. I do enough of that working from home, and for that matter I spend enough of my time staring at a screen. But I would love to find someone local I could get together with every week or so and have a face-to-face conversation with. I live in a pretty diverse, decent sized city (1-2 million people counting metro area), but I wonder how practical this would be.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have experience doing this? Tips, tricks on finding someone local to practice with?

languagelearning,How many languages around the house is too many for a new kid?,"New dad here—we are starting to figure out our language game plan for our new son. We’re both native English so he’ll obviously pick that up, but we have a lot of other languages that we can start using around the house.

Here’s what we have: mandarin (myself basic conversational, grandmother native, close friend fluent), Spanish (wife, grandmother, future nanny all fluent), French (myself conversational, close friend fluent). 

My question is if we should try to limit our household to just Spanish (which I can try to learn), just what we’re fluent/conversational in, or just try to expose him to everything.

###What I did
Watched children's shows from my childhood and their continuations and spin-offs, and read simple manga.

###Journal entries

**Tuesday**
It's no wonder English speakers can learn Spanish so fast, beyond the obvious cognates there are a lot of expressions that translate word for word like 
'... rests on your shoulders'


**Wednesday**
I wonder if there exists a natural order for vocabulary similar to the natural order for certain grammatical features. It would not be as strict, because
I think you can acquire almost any word if it's presented to you frequently enough in comprehensible contexts, even if the word is very rare on the average. However,
I think that the ability to retain them for an extended period of time may be limited by such an ordering principle that is more complicated than simple frequency.
For example, I just learned the word 'manga' which I believe means 'sleeve', but this word is probably not as frequent as most of the others I know, and I'm pretty sure
that I will forget it soon. But if frequency was all that there is to it, then I think that a lot more infrequent words should be present in beginners vocabularies, because,
while they are much less likely to be acquired, there is also a lot more of them.

**Sunday**
I just ordered the Harry Potter series from Amazon Spain and I learnt the word for Hungary in the process, about which I had doubts if it'd ever appear in my immersion but
I saw it when making my order so it's fine.

###Misc. comments

Any recommendations? Thank you!

languagelearning,An app to learn Arabic reading and writing,"Why do I feel that learning how to read the script of a language is so underrated? Most popular apps focus of different aspects of ""fluency"", grammar, and vocabulary, but not specifically how to read and write languages written in foreign script (e.g. Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew ... etc). In Arabic in particular, I see many approaches try to teach Arabic with romanization into Latin characters, which is pretty inconsistent to say the least. Otherwise, teaching the alphabet and the script is either too implicit in the learning approaches and is assumed to be learned while learning other things, or too explicit, dedicating whole sections or learning modules just to learn a single letter. 

In my case I am a native speaker of Arabic but I live in the US. I have been trying for many years to get my kids (14 and 11) to read and to write in Arabic (they already understand and speak reasonably), but it hasn’t been working. I tried many things: in-person programs, courses, apps, books, flash cards, and many other things, and it either didn’t work, or worked very marginally. 

So, this summer, I have worked specifically to address this: just to make something to get the kids to identify the letters of any given Arabic word and sound it out. I built a small app/web page in a quiz-style, so that they can practice on it for 10 minutes a day. Interestingly, in less than a week, and without any other resources, they were able to reach very high accuracy at the app and to actually start to read many things in Arabic; e.g. the menu items in Arab restaurants, Facebook posts and memes, and WhatsApp messages ,etc. I think this is encouraging, and I’m happy that they can finally start to read in Arabic. Of course there are many things still to learn, but I think this is a good start. 

I'd like to share this app with you, I suppose it can work well for both kids and adults wishing to learn how to read the Arabic script. It is still in an early version so I really appreciate any feedback!

Here is the link to the app (it is free):

languagelearning,I don’t know what to do :(,"hi, guys, I hope you’re all doing well. I have recently had a discussion with my mom, who knows about my passion for language learning, about my wish to learn Korean and Japanese and acquire a bit of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and French knowledge. thing is, I speak two languages fluently, Romanian and English, but I’m also learning German at school. when I go to college, I want to study in English, as the main language, meaning that I’ll have to choose a second one, and since many universities lack diversity regarding second language options, I most likely will have to go with German, where I have an A2, close to B1 level, and I’m highly aware that I still have a long way to go until I can reach “fluency”. my main concern is, though, that I really want to improve my Korean, since it’s the language, as of now, that I have most knowledge in, other than German, among the ones that I mentioned above and I really don’t want to give up on it, or stop my continuous improvement, since I’m currently studying a lot, because I know that language learning is one of my biggest passions and I would waste it all away if I didn’t put varied effort in, now that I have proven myself that I can do it. I really don’t know what to do, because my mom told me to focus more on German so that I’ll have a clear path in college. she didn’t directly tell me to give up on Korean or Japanese (I haven’t started seriously paying close attention to the Romance languages yet, so I’m a beginner), but although I like studying German, I don’t want to focus on it only. maybe I should prioritise it for now, until I progress, while still learning Korean and Japanese, just not as much, and once I feel I’m better, I can interchange the plans

I could get through them that way because even though I never noticed it anime had actually taught me some things, so it was all already seen. After that I studied kanji pretty intensely for 10 days or so (18-20 a day, which is a lot for me) and did lots of listening practice with transcripts. At that point I was studying 4 hours a day.

Right now I'm using a book that will get me to an intermediate level (Tobira), studying 4 hours a day plus 1.5-2 hours of other immersion. Now thing is, I did take into account taking a day off every 8-10 days, but whenever I try to *think* about actually using it I feel awful. Even though I know there would be the benefit of letting the things I just learned sit, and also I think it's fair to take a break after studying this much. 

Even knowing that I can't bring myself to just take a day off with no ""formal"" studying (I still listen to some stuff in japanese for enjoyment). Do y'all struggle with this kind of thing?

The vibrant indigo flowers of the Clitoria ternatea plant (or Sungupoo in Tamil) is a vividly deep blue flower with a light-yellow color in its center. The flower is native to equatorial Asia and is often grown as an ornamental plant. Butterfly pea flower tea, also known as blue tea , owed to its brilliant shade of sapphire, confers amazing health benefits like promoting weight loss and uplifting moods. An uplifted mood could also be due to the improvement of memory and cognitive function. This display of tremendous memory boosting can surely help you find your lost keys or slippers, right? Enjoy our recipe below [and video](https://youtu.be/cREF1acyd5w) which is in Tamil and subtitled into English as well as 9 other languages.

INGREDIENTS 1 cup fresh or dried butterfly pea flowers 1 litre water Lemon juice, to taste Honey or sugar, to taste

INSTRUCTIONS If using fresh flowers, remove and discard the green stalks and stems by pinching them away with your fingers. (note: this process dyes your fingertips slightly. It goes away with a few washes, but wear gloves if you’d prefer.) Dried flowers can be used as is. Rinse the fresh flowers thoroughly a few times to remove any dirt from them. Heat water in a pot and turn it off just before it starts to boil. Add the flowers to the water, clamp on a lid and wait for it to steep for 3-5 minutes. The water will be a deep blue by this time. Strain, decant into a glass jar, and refrigerate. To serve, add 1 part concentrate to 5 parts cold water. Sweeten with honey if using and squeeze over enough lime to taste. Stir and serve over ice for an iced tea . This tea can be served hot too, with the same ratio of concentrate to water.",1627704132,TUBETHAMBI,2,312,1891,46,8

languagelearning,Why do people ask if you speak a language you're already conversing with them in?,"Upper B2 moving into C1 in Spanish.

Why do people ask this question when you're already conversing in the language? I run into this fairly often, where someone will ask me if I speak Spanish when we are already in a Spanish-speaking context. Everytime it happens it throws me off a bit - I'll answer very briefly and the person usually ends up thinking I don't speak the language. If we're able to move on to different topics, they probably get the idea of my level, but after an awkward introduction and a bad first impression. 

After each time it comes up I'll think about how I should respond the next time, but it always catches me off guard and the same thing happens. It seems like a strange question to me when we're already in a context in which it would make sense for the person to just speak to me in Spanish and gauge my level (like, ask me literally any other question about myself ((in Spanish)) and kill two birds with one stone!). Do others have this happen, and find it odd or off-putting? Again, it's always when I'm already in a Spanish-speaking context, it's not like I'm in a Wal-Mart in Texas and someone is trying to find out if I speak Greek or something.

My language skill is definitely a sore spot for me because of the way that I was thrown into learning Spanish (where anything less than complete fluency has never felt good enough) and my own perfectionism, so I don't know if I'm being a bit too touchy about this question. However, it sometimes feels like a weird power move. 

Most recently example: I was casually dating someone in a Spanish-speaking country. We went to meet up briefly with three of his friends whom I'd never met before. Everyone except for me is a native Spanish speaker and the entire interaction is in Spanish. We do greetings, sit down and they all start chatting a bit. One of them asks me where I'm from, I answer, and then he asks me ""do you speak Spanish?"" ""Ehmm..yeah."" ""How good is your Spanish?"" I fluster a bit because the question strikes me as an odd, and so I turn to my date, ""well, I don't know, what do you think?"" Date: ""I've heard worse."" \[Yeah, fuck him.\] Then that's that with the conversation, until a bit later the same person asks me how I learned Spanish. Another tricky question - as if there is one route to learning a language. ""Uh.. it's a long road,"" I say. ""It just takes practice,"" says guy. Finally when we get on to other topics I begin to be able to speak more freely and, really, everyone finally got their answer on whatever my level of Spanish is, way better than asking explicitly got them.

tl;dr : why do people ask if you speak a language you're already conversing with them in? Do you find it an attempt to be polite or a subtle attempt at throwing shade? Does this bother anybody else?",1627663668,calypsoorchid,43,515,2787,81,15

languagelearning,FREE English Conversation Class?,"Hey Language Lovers

TL;DL - Would you be interesting in attending a free (or donation based) English Conversation Class, and hour and a half Saturday morning 11am GMT+1? 

For the past few years I have been running a volunteer English class here in Paris. I've done beginner and more advanced classes. This past year it has mainly been conversation classes via Zoom.

I'm not a trained English teacher but I am a native speaker who is studying at university level who is also interested in learning languages (French, Swedish, Esperanto, Mandarin), so I think i've got a few bits of knowledge to pass on. 

I give the classes through a small association that mainly teaches French to new arrivals in France, I started learning French with them and wanted to give something back. 

Anyway, I'm rambling now, i'll get to the point.

I've loved giving these classes over Zoom for the past few months, an hour and a half on Saturday morning, I would pick a topic or grammar point and we would just discuss it. Like I said, I'm not trained so I would usually just go with the flow, it's all free for the students so I was always thinking that as long as I can get them using and listening to English then it's good. 

What I want to know is that if I were to open up the classes, to like everyone, would there be some people here interesting in taking part?

It would be somewhat informal in terms of me not chasing you up for homework blah blah blah but I could give you resources and maybe set up a duolingo class and whatsapp group. It would be a place where you could just come and use the English you already know and get confident in using it but also pick up some new stuff too.",1627652752,Psychological-Ad6814,0,311,1681,32,4

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I don't have any job and I have much time so today I decided to put in 12 hours each day for 6 months with some strategies:

&amp;#x200B;

**2 hours of listening and reading, How?**

I'll choose one video every day from My Story Animated or That's My Story channel, I'll enable English subtitles and keep listening. About reading I'll use my eyes only to see English subtitles during listening to the video ( kill two birds with one stone ).

Every video must have 10 minutes approximately and I'll repeat the video 12 times equal 2 hours.

I tested this strategy 9 months ago and I noticed when I repeat the video the level of understanding is increasing even if I don't know the vocabulary. Unfortunately, I did not continue like this because I was busy.

If you have any suggestions for other channels I'll be glad.

&amp;#x200B;

**2 hours of reading, How?**

In the previous way, I was practicing listening and reading together but now I'll practice reading only by reading a book named 4000 essential English words. This book is helpful because it contains short stories and questions to test you. This is a good way to learn new vocabulary.

If you have any suggestions for another book I'll be glad.

&amp;#x200B;

**3 hours of listening, How?**

In this way I'll be cooking, exercise and take shower, etc.. during listening but I think sometimes I'll become absent-minded. Is that will be okay or I must be a focus on the speech of the speaker?

&amp;#x200B;

**2 hours of imitation, How?**

I'll open any movie and choose 1 scene and I'll imitation a specific actor like pronounciation and way of speaking and I'll repeat the scene for 2 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

**3 hours of speaking, How?**

I'll find an academy that provides speaking practice between students, But to be honest, not sure yet, So I need your advice.

&amp;#x200B;

If I applied these strategies every day for 6 months, Where my level will be in English?

languagelearning,A small guide to increasing vocabulary,"Whether you are a language learner or a native speaker, having a large vocabulary is always valuable. It's not fun to constantly consult a dictionary when you are watching a video or reading a book. It's spirit-taking to be at loss for words because your vocabulary is too small. Your brain is full of ideas and topics to discuss, yet you are limited by your vocabulary.

In language learning, it is near impossible to begin practising grammar if your vocabulary is smaller than 500-700 words. You will be forced to rely on the sources that your native language provides.

You can know the grammar rules perfectly, but if your vocabulary is small, it will be really challenging for foreigners to understand you. Nevertheless, someone who knows around 2000 words will be understood easily, despite his/her grammar flaws.

# Passive and active vocabulary

You should be concrete about what you are trying to improve. You will not experience great growth by setting yourself a broad goal of increasing your vocabulary. Furthermore, there are two types of vocabulary.

Passive and active.

**Passive vocabulary** is the vocabulary that hides in the back of your skull. It consists of words you understand, but are not capable of using.

**Active vocabulary** is the vocabulary that hides in the front of your mind. It consists of words you understand and are capable of using (in the form of speaking or writing).

You can evaluate your active vocabulary by observing the most used words by you during a conversation or a writing session (you can't keep many words there).

Nonetheless, evaluating your passive vocabulary is a lot more difficult. It's much bigger than the active one. You don't use every word you read in the book or listen to in a lecture. There's an abundance of words that you know, yet don't use. This is what's called passive vocabulary.

# Ways for increasing passive vocabulary

In my experience, the process of enhancing your passive vocabulary is not hard (compared to the process of active vocabulary). Two things have worked wonders for me. They are Anki and consumption of content.

Anki is a free flashcard program that uses spaced repetition for long-term memorization.

**Spaced-repetition** is a learning technique that is usually performed with flashcards. The new and strenuous flashcards are introduced more often, while the older and easier flashcards are shown less often.

If I desire to learn 20 particular words, I put them into Anki, add their definition, pictures, examples, and audio. I try to use as many senses as possible because it was proven to help memorization.

When it's time to repeat the words, I open the Notes app on my phone and type their definitions. Then, I come up with my own example (or two) for every word. Sometimes, instead of making an example, I write out an interesting fact about that word (its origin, for instance).

Every time you repeat the word, you must come up with a new example. It can be tiresome sometimes, but it's worth it.

&gt;A tiny hack: if a word has two meanings or more, add separate flashcards. It will save you some pain in the ass when you know the first meaning, yet forgot the second one.

And the best method for acquiring a large passive vocabulary (in my opinion) is **consumption of content**. It does magic for everyone.

All you have to do is to search for challenging content that will throw unknown words at you periodically. Advanced learners may face some difficulties here. Their level is so high that YouTube videos and TV shows rarely surprise them. I advise reading, in that case.

Beginners and especially intermediate learners are lucky. Their knowledge is not so giant and therefore YouTube and movies are perfect for them.

You don't have to look up every word you hear. Try to guess its meaning from its context. If you can't, you can continue watching the episode without guilt. If you hear it more than 3 times, then you have to google its meaning (this is the method I used).

However, if you are reading a book, then I would counsel you to look up every word.

# Ways for increasing active vocabulary

If you have a desire to enrich your speech and become more fluent with the language, then you have to work on your active vocabulary. It's not easy. It will put you out of your comfort zone, but the results will warm your heart, I promise you.

Pick 10 words you wish to have in your daily speech and writing practice. And give yourself a week to practice them as much as you can. Write them out on a piece of paper and carry them everywhere. When you write, use that piece of paper as your guide. When you talk, make it your goal to use at least one of them in your conversation.

Every word must be used **at least 5 times** in the course of that week.

After 7 days, pick another 10 words and repeat the process. The more frequently you use the words, the better your speech active vocabulary will become.

It's OK if you forget some of them. Your goal is to retain at least 1.

This what has always worked for me. It doesn't mean that it will work for you. 

I hope I could be of help.

languagelearning,I was wrong. TPRS is fascinating.,"A couple of years ago I saw [an hour-long YouTube documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=illApgaLgGA) made by a Spanish teacher in the US about his one-year quest to get to conversational fluency in Arabic without direct study.

I thoroughly enjoyed it, and used some of the ideas in it to help get my start learning Korean.

But one thing from that video that I was extremely skeptical of was TPRS (Teaching Proficiency Through Reading and Storytelling). I watched some demos online and it just seemed... incredibly boring. I couldn't wrap my head around it.

Then I had an opportunity to try a TRPS lesson in a language I have never studied (and don't have any immediate plans to study). My mind was blown. I was 100% engaged the whole time. My brain felt like it was in some sort of hyper-focused overdrive. I woke up the next morning with phrases from the lesson rattling around in my head. It usually takes _a lot_ of exposure before I start hearing that din in the head. This was less than an hour.

When I see people write in my native language, their problem is almost never vocabulary. It's things like prepositions. Word order. Getting the nouns and verbs to agree in terms of tense, gender, and number. More word order. More gender.

Don't get me wrong, vocabulary is crucial. It's hard to read an interesting book without vocabulary. But vocabulary doesn't seem to trip language learners up the way grammar does.

What I think TPRS gets right is the concept of _micro-fluency_ with a sheltered vocabulary for the very first stage of learning a new language. It seems like it almost doesn't matter at first what the early vocabulary is, if you're getting an intuitive sense of all the basic bits and pieces of grammar.

This in turn means that early lessons or content can use whatever vocabulary is going to be easiest to make comprehensible, even if those things aren't necessarily things you'd generally encounter in day-to-day life.

So, yeah. I was wrong :) TPRS is pretty cool, and if you have the chance, you should totally try a lesson in a language you know nothing about, just for the sake of experience.",1627597492,bildeglimt,82,368,2131,33,6

languagelearning,Non-heritage speakers passing down new languages to their children.,"Hi everyone - I'd like to get some thoughts and opinions on something that I've been thinking about a lot lately. 

For context, I am from the U.S. originally (Black American), but I did not grow up in the U.S. or really live here until my late 20s. I speak 3 languages (I'd say the 3rd I'm at a C1 so not perfect, 2 of them I learned in my teens/early 20s due to living in the Middle East as a child and also 2 Latin American countries. I use all 3 in my daily life due to my family make up and my work and general interests. 

I am now thinking about my future with my partner and having children. He is not from the U.S. and also speaks another language as a heritage speaker (not really fluent tbh, but it is something that would be passed on to our children just by exposure to his family). 

It is of utmost importance to me that my children are multilingual - it's just not up for negotiation because the benefits and opportunities that it has given me are immeasurable. I want to teach my children, and keep them exposed to both Arabic and Spanish and I am already speaking spanish 50% of the time anyway because I am teaching my partner, I have many only-spanish speaking friends, and I work as a translator. 

Passing down languages as a heritage speaker is something that feels like a no-brainer to me, and also an extension of culture, but how are people navigating passing down languages that they've learned/taught themselves later in life? A part of me wonders...do I have the ""right"" to pass down something that is not a part of my own actual heritage? Is it weird that my family speak languages that technically do not ""belong"" to us, even if we are fluent? Can it become generational? 

I guess I'm thinking a lot about how new generations and linguistic bloodlines are being created, as we become and remain more global and inclined to learn new languages together. I don't want it to stop with just my parents and me, so what does this look like and mean for cultural and linguistic ownership? Do these languages belong to people and communities? Are they now mine too?

languagelearning,How to go from semi-fluency to full fluency in Spanish?,"So I took Spanish in high school/college and lived in Mexico on my own for a few months with no English speaking assistance, and have travelled through Spanish speaking countries with no major assistance. I also deal with Spanish speaking clients regularly at my business and communicate with them.

My problem is that I feel like I'm just below fluent, and I'm not sure how to address that. Like, I tested out of Duolingo and 9/10 times I can get my point across in Spanish, but it doesn't feel natural. Like, I sound clunky if I'm not prepared for the topic. I feel like my written and speaking comprehension are great, but I have trouble understanding spoken Spanish sometimes (except Mexican Spanish lol, my host family joked that I spoke Mexican because when I met a Chilean guy, I was totally lost and kept asking him to repeat stuff). I can understand movies/TV/games in Spanish pretty well, so long as the subtitles are on. 

So like... where do I go from here? I really want to sound professional in my Spanish and improve my listening ear.

languagelearning,Chinese or German? :(,"I've never posted on this subreddit but I need some help.

So I go to a high school that teaches both Chinese and German, and I decided to take both of them because my schedule was able to fit it in. I am currently a senior and going into my 4th year of Chinese and 5th of German, but today I learned that I am no longer able to fit both into my schedule since both are during the same class period. I love both of these languages equally and genuinely can't make a decision or just ""replace"" one like my school counselor says I can easily do. I contacted all of my language teachers and they can't help me either. So I've come to reddit to help me list the pros and cons since I can't rationalize this on my own as of right now. 

In college I'm planning on majoring in German with a minor in Chinese and Korean. I'm way more advanced in German than I am Chinese, so if I take German I can stay at that level, but I probably won't be able to keep my progress in Chinese as I don't have anyone to speak at home with. If you're from the US, these are also AP classes, so I can take the final exams in the classes for college credit. If I take Chinese, I may still have the opportunity to do the German AP exam along with the Chinese AP exam, even if I'm not in the class. I would also probably lose some friends as they would think I just quit German out of nowhere, even though this isn't the case. I'm in both National German and Chinese Honor's Societies and again I love these languages equally with a burning passion. I'm not sure if I can use one of my free periods as an independent study. It also sucks because I'm a peer tutor for German and I'm not sure if I would be able to keep my spot as that and in NGHS if I choose Chinese, or if I can keep my spot in NCHS if I choose German. Thank you for listening to my rant.

languagelearning,Busuu sometimes won't let me progress without premium.,"For the past 2-3 days, I've been using Busuu to learn French. The first day went swimmingly. On the second day, I had done about 8 lessons, but had to skip 7 or so because it wouldn't let me access them without premium...which makes no sense at all. After that, I tried going back to my older lessons to review them and start taking notes in order to help me actually remember what I was learning, but I can't even access them!   


Today I was able to view some of those despite it telling me that yesterday, I couldn't. So I was going through them, and all of a sudden I can't access ANY of the lessons whatsoever. I heard amazing things about Busuu, and it was going great; so I figured I must be missing something, or there has to be a bug of sorts.

languagelearning,Playlist Sharing,"**TLDR:** Sharing a couple of Tidal playlists of songs in specific languages for comprehensive input. Will make versions on YouTube Music and Spotify.

&amp;#x200B;

Whilst I'm coming to the end of my nursing degree and therefore have put a hold on any language learning progress (other than reviewing the odd Anki flashcard when they come up), I have never not been interested in music. In fact, it's been a necessity with me working on my dissertation. I also really value input when it comes to language learning, so I've been attempting to build playlists of songs that I enjoy divided up by their languages.

Please keep in mind that there will of course be a lot of bias in these playlists. There are most of my favourite songs in here somewhere. That being said, I do try and add a wide range of different genres and sound signatures to my playlists and will be updating these regularly.

Here are the playlists I have at the moment (as mentioned, these will be updated so long as there is interest from folks);

\- [Korean](https://tidal.com/browse/playlist/79fc9e10-ee46-4dd1-86cd-fe68701a7fd1)

\- [Japanese](https://tidal.com/browse/playlist/b27e36df-10d0-4114-b1d5-d9a2c5248afb)

These are on Tidal, but I am going to work on making identical playlists on YouTube Music and Spotify (over time, please remember that I do have to prioritize my last few months of university).

Hope this will help some of you! Please do feel free to hijack this post to add any of your own playlists. I always love having new music recommendations so you'll have one guaranteed listener.",1627579479,RevolutionaryDance51,1,274,1766,16,2
languagelearning,Strategies for Improving Reading Skills (Intermediate-ish?),"So, I've been using LingQ to read in Spanish for about 5 months consistently now. I'm at the point where I can basically get the gist of everything I read in Spanish (articles to adult novels), though I know my accuracy isn't 100%. I only feel fairly confident with native language books aimed at grade schoolers (7-12 years old). The conventional wisdom on improving my reading ability is to just keep reading and don't worry so much about looking up the definition of words or studying grammar, but I'm finding it hard to believe that my reading accuracy and fluency wouldn't improve more quickly if I did some additional studying. Like...my 12 years of English classes weren't completely useless.

The same teachers can have an A1 class on the first period then a C2 class on the second period. 
I noticed that for some reason they keep the same methods for learning between levels and its honestly annoying.

The books we had for it were even worse. They could have a definition for the word ""indubitably"" right after defining ""clothing iron"". I think they sometimes forget the level they're supposed to teach and when someone reminds them they switch for a little bit and then forget again. 
I want to polish my reading comprehension skills but it's hard to focus when i have to write down the word that I already know or else I'll be punished for not writing anything. I'm sick of ""put the paragraphs in the correct order"" when there are countless combinations that sound perfectly alright. I'm tired of teachers only accepting the answers they think are right while completely disregarding that other answers are also correct because ""the book says so"".

I've studied all three at some point in the past and I've got my language learning system down so I feel like I could learn any of them without too much effort but I really would just want to stick to one for now.  Here are my personal pros and cons but give me your opinions!  

French: Plus is I'm over the hump on this language.  Studied it the longest, had personal tutors when I was in high school for a few years, got to a very decent conversional level and felt fluent in what I knew, but it's all gone now.  I'm over the issues that I think most people have with the language like knowing how words sounds based on spelling, etc.   Minus is that it's practically useless in my day to day, only French cultural stuff I'm interested in is some French music.

&amp;#x200B;

Italian: Plus is it's the language of my ancestors who stopped speaking it when they came to the US, which is such a shame.  I think I would feel closer to my past and I would really like to travel to Italy again sometime soon.  To my ears personally it's sounds the best of the three.  Cons are same as French except I really can't think of anything I currently do that would benefit from knowing Italian.  Maybe I would watch more Italian movies but probably only apart of the language learning process.

&amp;#x200B;

Spanish:  Plus is that it's obviously the most useful.  I live in the southern US so there are Mexicans/people of Mexican descent everywhere.  I've never been in a situation where just a little Spanish was beneficial, it's usually either you need a high level to get done what you need to get done (thinking professional applications) or the person speaks enough English to get it done so I can't really say that the little Spanish I do know has been that useful, but maybe if I got to a high level.  Cons are it sounds the worse to me, and I've just never been attracted to the Spanish diaspora culture at all.   I feel like I would be choosing utility over aesthetics which bothers me, but might not be a bad choice to make.

languagelearning,Best way to improve your listening skills.,"Its so easy you might not believe it or feel silly for not doing it from the beginning.  If you don't have a way to be in contact with native speakers you can always learn for your own voice. Reading articles and books out loud practicing phrases in your car or in the shower until they almost sound perfect to you. Just reading in your mind is such a precious waste of time (Read out loud!!!) It also means looking silly in the market when your practicing words and not caring. You will need to improve your accent so it can work. That means daily practicing words and phrases and being really critical of yourself. This is very vital. If your gonna learn form your voice your pronunciation needs to be really good, If it don't sound good don't accept it say that fucking sucks and keep imitating it like a monkey reading advice on forums and watching YouTube videos.

languagelearning,Choosing between improving Spanish vs. German?,"**Why German?**

- I've lived in Germany and have had plenty of exposure to German language and Germany. I could *potentially* be moving to Germany again for 2-3 years. 

- I've a higher proficiency level in German. It used to be B1, now it's become much rustier and is around A2 level. Ideally, I'd like to be at least C1 level proficient.

- You *can* live in Germany without being very proficient in German, especially in Berlin. Most Germans speak English anyway, and disappointingly, I found Germans to be less communicative and supportive whenever I wanted to switch to German. Topmost reason for learning German is for professional reasons as being proficient in German could be very helpful. However, note that by the time I'll be proficient, the Return-on-Investment could be much smaller. 


**Why Spanish?**

- I absolutely hate the articles in German and have difficulty remembering them.

- Most importantly, German does not interest/appeal to me that much due to
 - a) lack of interesting (for me) media - movies/music/etc. and, 
 -  b) Spanish is far, far more useful as a language for traveling. Fewer Spanish-speakers are proficient in English than German speakers. 

- I find Spanish easier and more exciting to learn. Technically there's nothing stopping me from learning Spanish after German but I am doubtful if I'd have the necessary appetite for that by then. 

- My Spanish used to be A2. Currently its around A1.

- Spanish opens the door to other Romance languages, especially Italian and Portuguese, which could come in very handy later on for travel.",1627458691,Vibgyor_5,13,262,1578,46,6

languagelearning,It's driving me crazy. I really need help--please,"I've been learning English for 10 years now. and I made two mistakes, and now they're driving me nuts. So I'd love it if you guys could help me sort this out.

I can understand everyone and I really mean it. Music, movies, tv shows, youtube videos, you name it. I understand everything without subtitles or lyrics.

The first mistake was I didn't practice speaking. I was born in a place where speaking a foreign language especially English is considered fancy.

And people used to relentlessly critique me for it. So I skipped the speaking part. and I'd always watch movies and listen to music on headphones so nobody could hear what I was listening to and whatnot.

My second mistake was I got too technical with English. I studied grammar, the phonetic alphabet, elision, assimilation of manner and place...mouth position, pitch, rhythms, and whatnot. In other words, I can break down the English language into pieces and write a book on it, but I can't use it 

My problem is:

I'm a native Portuguese speaker, but I was born in a region of Brazil where the language is more stress-timed. I theoretically know how syllable stress works; you gotta linger on it, change the pitch and say it louder. but in practice, I just can't do that. When I'm not aware of what my mouth is doing nor am I not thinking about it, I can get the rhythm right off the bat, but then I always mess up when I repeat it. I've seen many videos on youtube where they're like: pay attention to how these functional words sound swallowed and unclear compared to the stressed syllables. and that's the problem. I've been listening to English for so long that even the functional words sound clear to my ears. I swear I can freaking understand and hear every single function word or maybe my brain just fills the blanks up automatically--IDK. I'm a musician and also a big fan of music especially rap and I've been listening to Eminem since I was 13 when I started learning English. I could understand his new songs and I didn't google the lyrics. But I can't consciously replicate the rhythm of English. I know the rhythm is embedded in my ears and brain but I don't know how to pull it off--- because it always throws me off when I listen to non native English speakers and they don't have the right rhythm, you know. it's hard to explain my problem because it doesn't make that much sense. But I can recognize when my rhythm is off because I have a hard time understanding myself when my rhythm is off. In other words, I have the listening of a native-like speaker but I speak like a beginner when I'm conscious. I have friends who haven't gotten so technical with English and their rhythm is just perfect. Btw I'm a musician so rhythm for me is second nature.  I feel like my knowledge has become my curse you know.

&amp;#x200B;

So I don't know what to do. is there anyone out there whos been through it? and what did you overcome it please? or please if you have a recommendation please let me know",1627455004,DgWuLtB,5,542,2979,49,8

languagelearning,What would you study: Japanese or Chinese Mandarin?,"First of all: each person has their own inspirations and reasons to learn a language and that might take an important role when deciding which language to learn. But which language would you choose to learn? I think of starting to study either japanese or chinese mandarin by the next year and I really don't know which one I should, because I am very interested in everything that revolves around both. Some thing that should be taken in consideration are:

* The number of speakers: According to Wikipedia, the total number of Standard Mandarin Chinese speakers is of 1.120 billion people (921 million native speakers + 198 million foreign speakers) while the total number of Japanese speakers is of only 126.5 million (126.3 million native speakers + 121.5 thousand foreign speakers) ...... this may be an advantage of a disadvantage, depending on your opinion and on your goals
* Simplified vs Traditional Chinese: Generally speaking, Singapore and the People's Republic Of China (mainland China) use Simplified Chinese while Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau use the Traditional Chinese for writing. This has historical roots and even though all of these countries have their own dialects or languages, it is important to keep this in mind if your goal is, for example, to learn chinese to work in a Taiwanese company.
* The difficulty of both languages: while for westerners both japanese and chinese look (and are) very hard to learn, they have their own difficulties. Standard Chinese, for example, has a very difficult spoken aspect: the tones. The way you pronounce a word or the small chunks of the  word can change its meaning a lot, and this takes some time to learn. Japanese doesn't have anything similar, but in counterpoint its grammar is WAY more complex in a million different ways.
* The number of characters you will have to memorize and the complexity of the writing system: In order to be completely fluent in reading/writing chinese you will have to learn about 3000 - 6000 characters. Even though this seems like a lot (because it is), setting smaller milestones such as the 300, or 600, or 1500 most used characters can put you in an advantage. Meanwhile although the Japanese system inherits some chinese characters in the form of Kanji, which you will need to know eventually about 1000 to 2000 to be perfectly able to understand everything, it also uses 2 alphabets: katakana and hiragana, each with their own rules and uses. As I said, chinese and japanese have its differences also on their writing systems and one might seem easier than the other to different people.
* The amount of resources: Even though nowadays it is relatively easy to find resources to study both languages, Japanese seems to have more material avaiable. It is known that immersing yourself in the language can make the process of learning more effective. This can be done while passively studying through movies, podcasts, tv shows... and animes. Animes are a great way to make learning japanese more efficient and more fun, and in general I believe it can be said that there are more resources and more Japanese media accessible for foreigners than Chinese.

So... which one would you like to study? I graduate from high school in december and I consider getting into the engineering field or perhaps the law field. Even though it wouldn't really help me for studying law, do you think studying chinese/mandarin could help me in the long run? Thank you :)",1627450950,raphaelmvg,86,586,3456,51,8

I've never really tried to learn a language before, so I wanted to ask people more experienced than me if this is beneficial. Does listening to your target language and reading your native actually help? I get a lot of incomprehensible input living here in my daily life, so I feel like watching it only in pinyin and being unsure most of the time isn't that helpful. Should I watch once just with English subtitles and then a second time with pinyin? How do you use subtitles to improve when you're still a beginner?

I'm having a ton of fun creating the posts and playing the mini quizzes I create, would love to hear other French learners/speakers thoughts.

languagelearning,At which point do you move on from a book you are reading?,"When choosing which books to read as a B1/B2 learner, you have to rely on the opinions of other people.  
And you are not always going to know if   
a) you are going to like the book  
or b) if the book is going to be too difficult.  

Since long-time motivation is the most important thing in language learning, a) or b) would be good reasons to drop a book. You don't want to give up a language just because you forced yourself through a book you hate and lost all motivation in the process.

So there shouldn't be hesitation to drop books, but you also don't want to overdo it so that you never end up finishing anything. So my current rules are that I allow myself to drop the book:  
 
- in the first 50 pages: if the book is too difficult.  
- after 200 pages: if I don’t like the book.  

In Russian, this happened to me with Gogol, Saltykov-Shchedrin and Rubina (too difficult) and Salnikov, Ishimova (didn't like).

At first I thought perhaps something that intensive would considerably improve my Japanese.

Well I guess it made a difference but it's nearly August and I'm just absolutely burned out. What didn't help was that in June, the teacher decided to up the homework from weekly to daily. Writing homework and having to make a presentation about a topic isn't bad per se, but when it piles up so that you gotta do one about a random topic everyday, it really takes a toll on you. It doesn't help that the topics are very random and feels too much liked forced writing/speaking. My normal exposure before this class started was I watch anime without subtitles and read a lot of manga or light novels in Japanese.

While the book has a few words defined in the back of the book, most of what it seems to have is a sentence in German and then the English translation of the sentence. I don't feel confident that if I am looking at the sentence and then the translation of the sentence into English that I will be connecting the right words together. For all I know with my complete lack of knowledge about the language, the words could be switched around a bit from how you would put them together in English and I could potentially mix them up if that was the case in at least some instances and think that some word means something that it does not just because the position in the sentence is different than in English.",1627348750,ACyclist1,1,194,1015,146,25

I had an automatic renewing annual subscription. The full cost is $249 a year. Now what often happens with these automatic renewals is that one forgets their renewal date and are accidentally charged. Well that happened to me. So after noticing it one day after the renewal date on my credit card, I kindly ask for a refund. 

Unfortunately for me, the ChinesePod customer support says that they can’t refund any portion of the $249 annual fee even one day after the renewal date.

Does this seem fair to you? Even though it’s technically in their terms and conditions that they don’t have to refund any portion, it seems incredibly short sighted to burn a formerly loyal customer because I forgot to cancel the subscription at some point last year. 

So if you’re considering ChinesePod I think you should reconsider. They’re not fair or understanding, in fact it’s actually quite exploitative to not give any warning to someone with an annual subscription then be so inflexible after the renewal.

My leisure time is usually composed of: 

\- Youtube

\- one episode of a series at night

\- random googling during the day. 

\- Audiobooks (if I'm commuting, but lately I'm not)  


The languages I've learnt had tons of quality materials. But here comes Russian. Could their series be any crappier? Anyone here found something that is NOT about murder cases ?

I know they have good movies, especially from the Soviet times. But for movies, you first: need to search for one, then watch it for 2hours, and it's usually pretty heavy-spirited. 

Audiobooks don't seem to be a thing in Russia, or at least I haven't found any. They do post Russian read American books on youtube that I sometimes listen to, but I'm still struggling to listen to them for a long period of time (maybe I'll try again when closer to a C1 level).

There's a few number of kids in the world who finish college with a B.A. by 11 to 18. I know the parents mentioned they enjoy learning. Which is awesome, but in order someone to enjoy learning you have to grow that. So I wondered if those parents gave everything they could into advancing them. They usually put them a science degree route.

I want my kids to learn fun things like foreign languages and music. I myself am working towards becoming a Foreign language teacher. 

How can I immerse them into school while also not robbing there childhood. I actually knew someone who was 18 and working toward there Ph.D. and my friend said that he was a little off as a person. Just a little. He seemed to enjoy T.V. like veggie tales. So I think there parents weren't to strict. 

I don't believe we should be restricted on how quick or fast we want to learn. 

I promise to keep them in my house by the time they are 30 years old so they can emotionally develop better as adults and function right. If they want to. 

It might be a controversial topic because some of you would want your own kids to experience differently. But this is my approach. So please give advice to my approach. Try not to ridicule it or completely give a different option. 

I also don't like the school system. I feel like if they introduced college in high school it would be better because were still trying to figure things out. I feel like if I put my future kids into college like at 5 or 10 years old they will explore so many beautiful things. 

I feel like this world we naturally feel like we don't fit in anyway and were all meant to be unique. I hope I don't sound strict or crazy. I'm just trying to give them more opportunity.

languagelearning,Do you have to understand every word in an article/show/conversation (for an elongated period of time) to be considered fluent (B2) in a language?,"I feel as though I already know the answer (that being “no”), but was wondering when fluency is achieved. From my understanding, fluency is achieved at B2 on the CEFR, while C2 is considered proficient/very advanced. I, for example, can follow newspaper articles in German, for the most part interviews (but I need to work on my listening skills more), and can converse fairly well with my language partners, only interrupting the conversation maybe once or twice in a 1.5-2 hour long conversation. I don’t consider myself fluent, I just say I’m “becoming fluent” so as not to oversell or undersell myself. Regardless, while reading newspapers I still miss maybe 10-20 words in an article, but can still summarize what the author is arguing, and even repeat back conversations in English to my friends after having a conversation in German.

Since the three languages are relative easy for English speakers to reach a high level of reading skills, that is to say within the span of 1-3 years of studying. So I would expect myself well-equipped after mastering the reading in these three languages.

However, just in case, I want to ask speakers of various languages out there: 
Is there any well-known book in your native language and culture, that has not been translated into any of the above languages?

languagelearning,I have an idea to pain my nails with letters and I need help,"So, the idea is to have 10 languages, 1 language per finger, and I want to have each nail to have a certain letter/character/combination/whatever that would represent a certain language, they feel all have some specific printing type (like for example it's fracture for German). By no means I speak all 10 language, I speak 2, study 3rd one (mandarin) and kinda slightly dabbled in most others. Still interested in all of them and hope to dive deeper once I feel comfortable with my level of mandarin. So, the languages are Russian (my native), English, French, German, Spanish, Arabic, Hebrew, Korean, Japanese and Mandarin. And here is my ideas (or lack of them):  


1) Russian - that one is quite hard for me since it's native and I can't look at it as studied language. I feel like ""Ж"" is a very charasteristic letter, other ideas are ""Б"", ""Ъ"", ""Д"", ""Я"".  
2) English - I feel like ""th"" is very characteristic for English and it's very hard for me to came up with literally anything else.  
3) French - I think circumflexed vowels looks quite characteristic for French, but so as for other languages. Another my thoughts are about ç or æ  
4) German - to me the most characteristic thing about german is ""ß"" or umlauts (like ""ö"").  
5) Spanish - quite obvious ""ñ"" for me, but I may be wrong about this one, don't know much about Spanish  
6) Arabic - same with Spanish, for me it's Alef ""أ""  
7) Hebrew - I know pretty much nothing about Hebrew, but it have very cool script and sound, so I would like to hear some ideas from Hebrew speakers  
8) Korean - I don't speak Korean at all, but I can sorta read Hangul. I'm not sure what character would look more ""korean-ish"" and be appropriate at the same time  
9 and 10) - Japanese and Mandarin. Well, first of all, it should be distinct from one another. I'm also not sure if Japanese supposed to be represented by Kanji or Kana. And there are tons of characters and I'm not sure about any of them

Now that it's over and I caught up on sleep, I want to share my experiences with it since I see questions about how much studying to do per day or per week every so often (as always, YMMV as everyone's circumstances are different).

1) Studying that much is not easy. In fact, I fell behind on Days 4+5 due to stress from a medical appointment and had to catch up on Days 6+7, which was kind of brutal.

2) Some methods/skills are easier to practise than others. Know how much brain and focus you need for each and try to plan the more difficult things earlier in your study session.

3) Frequent breaks! Go for a walk, meditate, play a game for half an hour, browse social media, anything to give your brain a short rest.

4) Having a study buddy is awesome! (We didn't study together but frequently talked during the week to share progress, air frustration, ...)

5) Short intense challenges like this can be a great motivator to get a LOT of studying done, but I sure was glad when it was over and I could take a day off to rest and do other stuff. Six hours a day would not be sustainable for me for an extended period of time, but I do know now that it is possible for a short while.

###Journal entries

**Monday** I take back what I said about ustedes, there appears to be a proper 2pl pronoun which is vosotros. But I'm I think that the conjugation of verbs might still be the same
for 2pl and 3pl, for son and estan at least. My current best guess for ustedes is that it's just a plural of usted, which is the polite version of the 2sg pronoun like
Ön is in Hungarian. (There is a similar distinction in German but I don't remember the word.) Except that if this is the case than it must be used in much less formal 
situations than it would be in Hungarian. Anyways, I listened to some Spanish Spanish for practically the first time and it definitely impacts my comprehension.
I can't really pin-point any difference other than the fact that it's just harder to understand and that it has a th sound in place of an s sound when it's written with a c

**Tuesday** I came to a point where I almost never notice myself learning new words like I did in the beginning. This actually comforts me somewhat because this is what my experience with
immersion in other languages has been like, in fact, I was very surprised in the beginning by how conscious I was of the process, but now I can just sit back and let my
subconscious do the work. I will still make conscious guesses about the grammar purely because it's fun, I don't actually expect it to take me anywhere. I don't even find
myself guessing the meanings of words that I recognise all the time but don't know yet, the two that annoy me the most currently are 'ya' and 'se'. Furthermore I think I might
be starting to develop an intuitive sense of the difference between 'estás' and 'ser' which are the two main ways of expressing 'to be' for example 'estoy bien' sounds
much better than 'soy bien' and when giving your name 'soy' sounds better, but this is not at the point where either of them would sound wrong to me, yet.

**Saturday** It appears that a lot of scenes were censored in Dragon Ball. The problem is that they just staight up leave those parts in Japanase on every site I tried. 
Dragon ball Z seems to have a lot less censored scenes and they are also subtitled in Spanish, so what I do is I rip my headphones off my head when one these scenes
start, read the subtitles and put my headphones back on after the subs stop coming. I still count this as Audiovisual though because switching categories is a pain,
and it happens rarely enough that it should be negligible. On a completely unrelated I figured out a few days ago that the word for 'tomorrow' and 'morning' is the same.
I thought that this would be terribly confusing, but to my surprise it's really not, at least I didn't have any problems with it these past few days.


**Sunday** Rating content on my scale every week actually helps a lot with my motivation. Without it I don't think I'd notice any improvement, they force me to think more concretely
about how well I'm actually doing instead of just thinking 'yeah I understand some but not all', it makes me appreciate progress that I otherwise wouldn't even notice.
More great news: throughout the week I've been trying watching a bit of several different shows from my childhood and I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to choose 'easy content'
without much trouble, which has been a major source of stress so far. Yeah sure Nagatoro and H2O were great but I would dread the time they would be over because I had 
no guarantee that I'd find more things that are as 'easy'. This is not a problem anymore and I'm very happy, because honestly, this was the worst part of the experiment.",1627209305,faceShareAlt,34,746,4200,105,19

Here's the thing : I learned Italian for 7 years and I stopped having lessons when I got into college.

Now, I forgot the majority of it, to not say everything.

Italian is the only language I learned at school that I don't remember. I don't know how the memory works when it's about languages but I honestly think that if I read, listen or watch in Italian daily it would be quick, easy for me to remember it. I also think it's more a vocabulary problem than anything else.

languagelearning,"What EXACTLY are the ""fixed stages of language learning"" according to SLA-theory?","Dear all, 

So according to Second Language Acquisition researchers, ALL human beings learn languages according to fixed stages which are the same for everybody. E.g. I remember Bill VanPatten mentioning that the singular is ALWAYS learned before the plural and that this seems to be built into all human beings [after minute 54 in this video https://youtu.be/vsX7ADtB2Pg ]. 

I recall Krashen making a similar case, i.e. that it is futile to ""learn"" and ""correct"" (consciously) say the instrumental case, when you haven't yet ""acquired"" it (subconsciously). And if you haven't acquired the instrumental case yet, this is only because your level of proficiency hasn't reached the stage where it's ready to incorporate said instrumental case within its subconscious map of the language. 

Long story short: there are certain fixed stages of language acquisition. My question is: What EXACTLY are these stages? 

When I look around on the internet, I find e.g. that babies start ""recognising words at 9 months"" or that they start ""babbling loose words"" at X months. But this is not what I should like to know. I want to know the EXACT stages of syntax/morphology/grammar that learners go through according to SLA-theory. E.g. the singular always comes before the plural. What about tenses? What about verb modes? Does the imperative come before the indicative? Where do pre-/postpositions come in? 

Looking forward to any suggestions!

My name is Victor I'm a professional software developer (currently working on a YCombinator Startup, in case you are interested) and have language learning as a hobby.

languagelearning,Looking to create a good study plan for learning French,"Salut !

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking to learn French and I am eager to find the most efficient study plan. I am 28 years old and bilingual English/Italian. I learned Italian as a child in school from the age of 8 to 18. I don't know if I can become fluent in French so easily but I am willing to try. I have been studying for 4 days.

I bought a subscription to Busuu because I feel it's better than Duolingo. I've done 30-45 minutes a day on the app, doing 4 or 5 lessons and reviewing grammar and vocabulary. In the evenings I watch a French tv series on Netflix with English subs. Around 3 episodes a night. On Mondays in NYC there's a French language conversation/apéro group that I plan to visit. I have already been once.

It doesn't feel like much, especially compared to my years of studying Italian, which were structured-lesson heavy, about 3 hours a week. How could I improve my study plan considering also that I plan to be getting back to work soon. What kinds of things can I do and for how long should I do them?

Ba - Be - Bi - Bo - Bu - bão 

Ca - Co - Cu - Cão

(…)

Ça, Ce, Ci, Ço, Çu, Ção

Cha, Che, Chi, Cho, Chu, Chão

Etc. 

We had these along with example words like for Ba we have ""Batata"", for Be we have ""Beliscão"", etc.

languagelearning,How to handle hurdles around learning a new and very different language?,"Hello! Before discussing the issue, some background: my native tongue is French and I have five years of language learning experience with Romance, Germanic (especially), and Slavic languages. The only non-Indo-European languages I've studied are Finnish and Northern Saami. I stopped dabbling two years ago and I spent 2020 awkwardly learning Russian, still focusing on it since it's extremely important to me. I decided to add another language since I got bored with Russian and I want challenges. Hence I chose Turkish, which I need anyway. 

I'm facing a set of unexpected hurdles, though. Despite being on my third day, I'm not motivated any more and I'm struggling to even find discipline. I somehow forgot how to ""get into"" learning a new language since I got so used to only doing Russian. And as you may know, Turkish has a very alien grammar compared to Indo-European languages. I thought I could battle it like I did Finnish (which to me was actually easy) but I was proved wrong. I'm trying to write short texts (WriteStreak) but it's a nightmare. I must check every single word like five times, then check three or five different resources for grammar, then I'm confused because they offer different ways, and I can't even remember new words despite repeating them and writing them using my usual techniques (which work well with Russian). I end up bored and I stop doing progress (were I anyway?). 

This sounds silly because no one should expect to do enormous progress within a mere three days of learning a very different language, but I kinda have always been extremely self-demanding and ambitious. I'm stuck because I'm trying to apply my Russian method and this obviously doesn't really work out that well. One of my pillars is writing a lot but I can't even do that since I barely know 20 or so Turkish words, grammar resources are confusing and contradictory, and I'm just unsure about what to do since all usual solutions barely work. 

Spontaneously, I'd say I should first focus on loads of listening and reading but that's boring to me: I can do that for 15 minutes but then I get bored and I just want to speak and write, and I can't however hard I try. I just spent 30 minutes trying to figure out a simple Turkish expression to try writing my daily text and I got fed up. Meanwhile, within 30 minutes, I could easily and spontaneously write a text in Russian. 

I'm sure many fellow language learners have been through similar issues. How did you solve them? Do you have any advice for people going through them? Perhaps also specific recommendations when learning a language pretty different from your native one?

How do people find resources to learn these fairly endangered languages? Is it even reasonably possible to consider yourself fluent one day? I’m really interested in keeping these smaller languages alive as I’m sure many of you are.  Northern Sami isn’t even the most endangered language in “Sami” region. Other languages up there are measured in the tens or hundreds of still living native speakers.

Basically has anyone else gone through the process of learning one of the thousands of endangered languages in the world? How did you source materials and would you consider yourself conversationally fluent?

[https://discord.gg/8xyHnKtmTq](https://discord.gg/8xyHnKtmTq)

The languages, which the server and its channels focus on, include:

\- **All major Germanic languages** (even Frisian or Faroese)

\- **All Slavic languages**! (even Sorbian or Ruthenian!)

\- **All major Romance languages** (including Catalonian and Occitan)

\- **Turkish**

\- **Greek**

\- **Albanian**

\- **Lithuanian** and **Latvian**

\- **Hungarian**

\- **Finnish** and **Estonian**

\- **Basque**

We're also planning to branch out to other languages of the region (Georgian, Armenian, Yiddish) as well, depending on the users demand. Now they can be freely used in #aliæ (other) channel, but they are going to have its own channels soon!

How are we different from the other servers?

1. Simple rules including ***the ban on speaking in English***, which means that the server is not about general conversations in English, but about actually learning the languages. However, every language other than English can be freely used.
2. We are not a server for all languages of the world, we focus on a specific region, so there is also a room for the less popular languages, unlike on the other servers, where such languages are put into the ""other"" channel.

languagelearning,Is reading more efficient than listening for getting new vocabulary and grammar topics?,"TLDR at end

I always hear people talking about that people should read more and if one wants to get a vocabulary through natural ways they should read, but can listening be as efficient as reading? I’ve always had a harder time with reading in German and Spanish. For context, I started studying Spanish in 1st grade and I had terrible spelling in both English and Spanish but it improved till 8th grade which was my last year, I had a couple years of a break but than started up again and while the listening came back quite fast ( recognizing words in rap songs after hearing them for first time after 2 weeks and watching master chef Mexico after 3 months) I was dependent on text to speech and speech to text for the first 5-6 months. Everyone says that Spanish has easy spelling, but even after 9 months I still mix up e and a, e and i , and s and c. I can hear and use acabar, reír, valer, and necesitar in speech, but deciding what sounds go to -er, -ar, or -ir and oft it’s s, c, or z, can be a nightmare. Wanting to progress without all the struggle, I start listening to native content really early on with German starting after a1 and for Spanish, during a2. I find Anki and flash cards too boring so listening to YouTube videos has really been my main method for German and after 2 years and over 1000 hours of YouTube with no subtitles I can understand 95-99% of most videos I watch and am only semi recently picking up books. I of course also look up some 1-5 words a day that I had heard and grammar topics once I notice them, but I haven’t done cards for more than a week at a time and haven’t done grammar excersises. Im not saying it’s the best as it takes much time but I got somewhere so... However as I repick Spanish up, I want it to be more efficient as I actually have a deadline (AP Spanish test) I’ve already gotten about 100 hours of YouTube and crime shows this past 2 months, but would it be more beneficial to go through the struggles of picking up literacy now to possibly learn more vocabulary in the end or should I just continue my strategy of getting vocabulary through videos and pick up reading once I know more words so I don’t have to battle learning how to read, picking up grammar, and learning new words at the same time? Even though English is my native language and they share the same script, I find it hard to see words as made up of individual sounds and putting these sounds to letters, dyslexia problems I guess.

TLDR: the actual skill of reading is harder than listening for me, so should I continue as having listening as my main focus or would it be more beneficial to try to better my reading skills if the brain theoretically can learn in the end more words through reading than listening?

I don’t know if it seems as though I keep on changing my main question throughout the text so I’m sorry in advance, I’m not the best at putting things together in a coherent manner sometimes.",1627068440,Free_shavacado606,28,557,2938,87,13

languagelearning,Question for language learners who have disabilities that affect their speech (and other things),"Hi! I'm autistic and I have difficulty describing my level of Spanish because while I'm up to a B2 in reading comprehension and a progressing B1 when it comes to writing and listening, my speaking ability is much lower. A part of this is because I haven't had much of an opportunity to talk with native Spanish speakers, but a part of it is also because I'm not good at speaking *any* language due to how fast I talk and how much I stumble upon syllables and words, obviously due to being neurodivergent. This is a problem for me even when it comes to two of native languages (English and Tagalog, especially the latter) and is only not a problem in my other native one, Hokkien, because all the words are monosyllabic. 

I'm sure other people here have disabilities that can affect their ability to speak, especially when it comes to a foreign language, and that there are likewise people with difficulties when it comes to hearing/reading/writing for similar reasons. My question is: how do you measure how far you've come with a language if this is the case? Do you still use CEFR or other standard learner levels? Do you disregard the respective component of the language you have trouble with? Or do you just eschew these levels all together since they're not accessible to us?

Brit with no formal education in languages, still rather keen to learn it, but feeling really burned out by a lack of progress.

I've been jumping around for months. I thought that with time I would make a decision, but I have gotten more undecisive. Unwillingly, I've been learning the two because of this. I even force my schedule for it. This has caused me certain anxiety. I don't know why I am so fixated on this problem. The thing is I wasn't like that.

languagelearning,"My native language makes me uneasy and anxious, and I don't know why","Hello, I'm sorry if it's the wrong subreddit, I've no idea where to go to. It's a very weird and specific case and I'm lost. It's sort of on topic and not at the same time.

I'm a french guy, 24, my native language is French, and in most situations, reading it or hearing it makes me absolutely uneasy, cringe, and stressed. I literally can't explain it, and I really wish it didn't make me feel this way.

It makes it really hard to express myself to people that only know French. Most of the time I simply don't talk. I used to have a therapist for unrelated issues and there were so many things I never spoke about because I couldn't bring myself to in French. Not that i would even know how to express myself in French because English comes first to me. I've gotten so much worse with French.

I can type it without feeling bad only with my brother and that's pretty much it. If I'm forced to with other people, I'll feel so bad inside. I usually can verbally speak it with strangers, but if it's typing then I'll want to nope out immediately.

I do absolutely everything in English, for years now. And as soon as I witness some French, my guts get twisted, and I have to distract myself asap. Sometimes I try to peak again to force myself and it never improves overtime no matter how many times I try.

My only guess is that repeated trauma that happened in French, while I was learning English on my own, is the reason for making me feel this way? And that me doing everything in English now could almost be like living another life, a much safer one? English also has opened so many doors to me, countless of ones, some that made me grow and understand myself better, some to be able to interact with the entire world with no more language barrier, etc, and I'm so grateful for it. 

Anyway I've never heard of anyone being anxious about their mother tongue so I have no articles to look up to. To be vague, my different traumas are physically related, school related, and multiple deaths in short span of time.
(I wasn't near fluent in English back then, if that matters.)

At this point I don't even know if I want to reclaim French. I keep trying and yet... I feel like the few exceptions where I'm fine with French are the maximum possible I can have and can never improve.

It gets to the point of thinking ""If I lived a life without French existing, I'd be happier"" and that's really weird to realize. Especially since well ... I live in France.

I'm still happy to know French, because it has a few good things, and languages in general are fascinating and if I had been a native English speaker instead I'd have struggled to learn French lmao so I'm glad I know it. But witnessing French is a Russian roulette for me, with so many more scenarios where I'll feel really anxious than scenarios where I'll be fine. I'd say 85% bad 15% good. Like another good example is that I love to help people that are learning French. This I don't mind, I guess because I am the one that proposed to help, the one that offered and willing.

On social media, usually you place your spoken languages in your bio to let your followers know, but it has come to me not putting FR at all. Only EN. I don't want people to come at me and start speaking French because I'd get uncomfortable. And then sometimes I feel like putting FR because I should try and let people know who I am still, only for me to remove it days again later because I can't risk people coming at me with French.

This post I'm writing, I've been wanting to do it for years but kept postponing because I kept hoping it'd get better, but guess what? It's literally because I once again today had to read French out of nowhere, without warning, felt uneasy and weird, and decided ""stop, I need answers"".

I'm sorry if the post doesn't make sense and goes back and forth with infos, it's 1AM.

I just want opinions I guess ... I don't know at this point.

I'd also happily repost this in a better subreddit if you know one better suited for it.",1626994920,2Zzephyr,31,753,4006,68,13
languagelearning,How do you overcome days where you aren't motivated,"**Brief Intro first:**
I have been studying Brazilian Portuguese for about 8 months now, and it has been great. My main reason for studying now is to be able to talk fluently with my girlfriends parents in Brazil - hopefully by the end of the year. I did a language test on iTalki and Preply, both put me at a B1. I currently have a lesson with a tutor 3 times a week (1 hour per session) and then I try to do some extra work as well (e.g. immersion, speaking with natives etc.)


**The Question: How do you overcome days where you aren't motivated?**
For about the last week, my ""motivation"" hasn't been great, it has slowly been getting me down. I noticed that I was making some really basic mistakes that I haven't made in a long time, or ever. I would know what I am trying to say is wrong, but I couldn't think of what was correct. I would then remember at a later stage in the day, and want to kick myself. Then I started noticing it while speaking, I had this feeling that I wasn't at the level I should be, or I wasn't making the progress I should be. 

I understand that the further on in a language you go and the higher your level, it's take a lot more to progress and see that progression. I decided to talk with my teacher about it, and some friends/colleagues about it, even though I knew what they would be saying, I felt it would be better to get it off my chest - I suppose this post serves that purpose as well now.

When you have had these types of days/weeks/months, how have you managed to get through them? Did you do anything specifically?

languagelearning,The most useful languages to know,"It has been said often enough here that this alone isn't a good thing to base your choice of what language to learn on, but still you've probably wondered at some point: Which language is the most useful to know? With what collection of languages would I get the most coverage? So I decided to take some time to research the answer and thought I'd share the result.

------------------

Firstly I just went through all the continents and see what languages popped up the most. For some continents this is pretty straightforward. 

With the Americas, the north is almost entirely **English** (in Canada this is combined with **French**). In the south it's mostly **Spanish**, plus **Portuguese** in Brazil. 

In Africa it's very roughly 1/3 **Arabic**, 1/3 **French**, 1/3 **English** and some **Portuguese**. Africa has a lot of small and often fairly isolated languages too, but the one mentioned are considered ""the business language"" of the countries. (The Arabic part continues on into the middle east too).

Europe and Asia are basically just chaos of many languages. The most notable ones for Europe are **German** and **Russian**, since they are the official or secondary language of a good number of countries. In Asia the only one that really stands out in size is **Mandarin (Chinese)**. But it should be noted that this is almost exclusively because of China’s high population. It has few secondary speakers.

------------------

Next I looked at with languages had the most speakers (favoring secondary over native). These were: **English**, **Mandarin**, **Hindi**, **Arabic**, **French**, **Spanish**, **Indonesian**, and **Russian**.

-----------------

Then I looked at what countries were considered to be the most “powerful” or culturally influential. There was a pretty common consensus on to following countries: United States, China, Russia, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan. And a few mentions of: India, Brazil, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Spain.

This gives us the following languages: **English**, **Mandarin (Chinese) **, **Russian**, **German**, **French**, **Italian**, **Japanese**, (**Hindi**, **Portuguese**, **Korean**, **Arabic**, **Spanish**)

-----------------

And finally, just generally which languages other sources considered to be the most useful: **Mandarin (Chinese)**, **Spanish**, **German**, **French**, **Arabic**, **Portuguese**, **Russian** and **Japanese**.

----------------

So as you can see on all fronts it comes out pretty clear which languages are the most useful. 

I’ve listed them down here below, along with how much time an English speaker approximately needs to learn the language (according to [effectivelanguagelearning.com]( https://effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/language-difficulty/)).

I am currently an international business student in France. We all had to choose 3 languages. I picked English, Chinese and spanish. 
My native language is French but I used to understand Lingala as well as a child (Congolese born and raised in France). I almost forgot everything and I need to learn it again . I also studied Korean and German in highschool (along with english and Spanish that at started at the time).

The thing is that I do not improve in any of these languages except the one that I have to study for college. And even there my grades are not that good comparing to the level of the other student in the class. I am progressing extremely slowly.

I would say that I am B2 in english, A2/B1 in chinese and spanish, A2 in lingala, A1 in German and I only know the alphabet and some basics expression in Korean.

I tried lot of different methods : assimil, expensives grammar books, translating song lyrics, pimsleur, lingodeer, fluentU, hello Chinese, mandla, drops, rosetta stones and duolinguo. The result is always the same : I give up after a few month losing motivation because i don't improve at all.

languagelearning,Bootstrap terms to start learning a language from the ground up when locals speak your native language?,"I'm a software engineer and I've taught myself about 15 programming languages. I'm 45 now and have been coding since I was 15.  The KEY thing I never did was I never really sat down and read a book trying to memorize the terms.

I just started doing it and using the language in practice.

Now the syntax and grammar of a programming language is far simpler than human/spoken language but I think the strategy could be apt for language learning.

I've been trying to do this over the years and when I watch TV I try to remember words, key terms, etc.

I'm in Mexico now and trying to learn Spanish and my comprehension is much higher.

I think there's a CORE basic language strategy here to basically learn key phrases like hello, goodbye, and then also temporal words like before and after and then basic verbs, past/future tense, and pluralization rules.

I THINK if you can learn this core, then you can communicate in a VERY basic version of the language you're targeting.

At this point you can order food, shop at stores, etc.  

When you're confused you can just communicate at the BASIC level and ask help to find the right spanish word, or explain the word you want. 

Is there a formal strategy for this?  It seems to be working for me and I'm working on a spreadsheet to help define this core.

Can you speak English?"" :(

languagelearning,When do you consider someone to be a native speaker or at least equivalent in language proficiency to a native speaker?,"I moved to Germany from Bulgaria with my family when I was 9 years old. I am 19 now. I went to a German gymnasium and graduated this year, with a fairly good GPA. I barely knew any German when moving to Germany, but now I am fluent. I went to a normal Gymnasium and learnt alongside the German pupils, I also regularly got fairly good grades in German (B to B+). The reason why I didn't get As is mostly because I just am not perfect at writing analyses, not because I didn't know the language well. I can perfectly communicate in German and express myself in every context, my German is often better than that of my peers which are German but generally less educated than me (not that I'm very educated as of now...). So, the question from my title comes up: Do you see me as equivalent to a German native speaker? I obviously am not a native speaker by definition, but I speak the language as well as one. I'm asking this question since I'll start studying (not Dutch) in the Netherlands as an international student, and the university offers courses in Dutch explicitly for German native speakers due to the similarity of the languages.

As we are now in the second half of the year, vaccination is on its way for a lot of countries and, we are slowly tackling Covid we know one thing for sure. The world has changed. We are more eco friendly (Or aware of it), globalized, tech-savvy and informed, meaning business has also changed.

Loads of people started learning new languages online, for example, Japanese is now the 3rd most learnt language in Duolingo. It used to be 7th. So, based on this my question is (**despite** English and Spanish),

&amp;#x200B;

 **What is the most useful language in the International, tech, business world after Covid?**

languagelearning,Language Learning Resources I've Seen No One Mention!!,"Ok so I've been in the language learning community for a good while. I've been here long enough to be following a lot of polyglots and language learners on social media, and I've also spent A LOT of time  online trying to find some free resources and sites to learn languages (bc I am poor T-T).

And here are two sites I've found that are not specific to any one language, but they seem like treasure troves (in my humble opinion) if you're looking for free stuff:

\- [pdfdrive.com](https://pdfdrive.com)

\- language lab McGraw-Hill app

[Pdfdrive.com](https://Pdfdrive.com) contains pdfs (obviously). On there, you can look for grammar books and even story books in your target language! This is not a 100% guarantee that you will find books for your target language, but there's a pretty vast selection of books on there, so it's really worth a try. It's pretty easy and all you have to do is search for your book, download it, and then you're done.

Language lab McGraw-Hill is an app that you can find on the app store! It has textbooks, audios, flashcards, and reviews &amp; quizzes (depending on the language you chose). To my knowledge, you do not have to sign in or have an account, all you need to do is be ready to learn! However, unlike pdfdrive, it contains a small selection of languages. Those languages are French, German, Italian, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese (I guess I should say they also have English grammar books, but they're mostly in English so....). These books (and the app) were created by McGraw-Hill which is an educational publishing company that creates textbooks for public schools in the USA (to my knowledge). It seems pretty credible, and worth a try in my opinion.

I thought that I should reiterate that this post is for people like me who want to learn a language but don't have the money to pay for subscriptions or lessons. Again, this isn't guaranteeing anything, but these are 100% free resources you should definitely check out and hopefully these will be helpful to you in some way.

I really hope this helps, and I also hope no one has said this before me! (if so here's a reminder I guess lol)",1626914731,CodaBoda78,7,378,2172,54,8
languagelearning,My personal language learning guide,"Hi all,

I made a language learning guide that I’d like to share. It basically talks about the process that I used to learn Spanish, plus a few other ideas, but it’s about language learning in general. It’s a continuous work in progress, and will always be, but I’ve been comfortable sharing its current state with people. 

Please feel free to take a look and post comments here with any questions. Critiques to the guide and to the strategies themselves are welcome as well because I’m learning too. Please excuse typos and the occasionally awkward writing structure, as I update this guide regularly so I’ll probably find the issue eventually.

BTW, for any busy health professionals out there looking to learn a language for their work — please start with the “Making A Study Plan” section, then go back to the beginning and read it straight through. I am a big advocate for language education for medical professionals in training and in practice.

Hope it’s helpful to somebody out there. 

Best wishes everyone!

languagelearning,"First milestone in Korean: 2,000 words","Well, I finally did it! Today unofficial learned the 2,000th word and it took me 133 days (about 30 days more than originally planned). I feel extremely happy!

I'm not writing this to brag about it (ok, just a little) but as a way to keep myself motivated and to hopefully motivate others to start and continue studying flashcards. At first I was really sceptical about the benefits of using flashcards because I had firmly believed that vocabulary needs to be learned in context, but it just didn't work in Korean. I had problems reading even the simplest of the sentences, and it was frustrating to check the dictionary every couple of words.

 I discovered Anki and downloaded Evita's deck and decided that I wouldn't stop until I learned at least 2000 words and here I am! The results are amazing! It may sound like an infomercial but it really made a HUGE difference. I even changed the language of Firefox to Korean! I started watching cartoons in Korean and I discovered that my listening skills improved a little, mainly because now I can recognise more words. 

So, if you're wondering whether using flashcards is worth trying, it definitely is!

The deck I downloaded has about 6,000 words, so I still have a long way to go, but as long as I don't stop, I'm sure I'll finish it by the end of the year.",1626910258,resU-TiddeR-noN,17,235,1312,38,6

languagelearning,I would like advice about when to start talking in my target language.,"Hello everyone! I have been learning Spanish by myself for \~8 months now and have a question about when to start speaking. The way I have been learning Spanish is mainly through ""immersion"" (I understand everyone has a different definition of what they'd call immersion). Basically almost all of the media I consume is in Spanish. When I first started studying Spanish I would only watch Dreaming Spanish videos. I fell in love with the method of learning they teach on this channel however I've seen many people on this sub go against a lot of the stuff the channel recommends. Specifically, when to start talking.  Pablo Ramón, the person behind dreaming Spanish, has a ""language learning roadmap"" for those learning solely through comprehensible input. He recommends not speaking until one has about about 700 hours of comprehensible input under their belt in order to have a good, clear accent. I am not sure where I would place myself as far as hours of input go, however falling the language learning roadmap I'd place myself somewhere in between 150-300 hours (most likely lower in this range). Now I have not ONLY done comprehensible input so far. I am currently working through Assimil Spanish and have just gotten to the 50th lesson. I have also completed 17 one hour iTalki lessons, I'd say about half of them I was not speaking though (Crosstalk or Storytelling) as well as attended a Mextalki conversation club. I enjoyed the Mextalki conversation club a lot (this was recently probably last month), I was paired up with learners of my level (I believe I am upper a2 possibly lower b1, however I went with the a1-a2 group) and a teacher that guided us through some questions and we'd all have turns answering them (I think the theme that week was related to work, questions related to jobs, careers, etc.). I had some difficulty speaking of course but I was able to get my point across. I would love to continue doing iTalki lessons and or the Mextalki conversation club however my fear of English bleeding into my Spanish is very high, I'm not talking just about accent (however that is a concern too) I'm talking about the ways in which I construct sentences. My iTalki tutors as well as the Mextalki tutor I had have pointed out the weird ways I will sometimes say things as it's my English constructions coming over to my Spanish. This fear of talking has also turned into a fear of reading. I recently started reading a book that I loved in my youth, now in Spanish, and was getting through it pretty well albeit slow. I ended up stopping reading in Spanish because I'm not pronouncing everything perfectly in my head. I now have restricted myself to ONLY watching (videos) and listening (podcasts). I am still watching Dreaming Spanish videos as I pay for the Patreon and have access to a very wide range of videos as well as the audio transcript for all of them on my podcasts app. However I have very recently (last week) started transitioning less from Spanish content aimed at Spanish learners like Dreaming Spanish, Easy Spanish, etc. and more to native content for natives.  Once I started learning Spanish I fell in love with the process of language learning and do not intend to stop at just Spanish. Although, Spanish is my favorite language and I can see myself living in or at the very least spending a significant amount of time in a Spanish speaking country (I'm in love with Mexico!) so my end result with Spanish vs any other language is going to be the most important to me. This is something I am very new to, and living in US I can count on one hand the people I know that can speak another language other than English so I don't have much of a community to fall back on for advice like this. I have a Brazilian friend who learned English almost solely through comprehensible input (I assume other than his formal teaching in school that he may or may not have gotten?) however he was not scared of talking and talked as soon as he could. However, he has a pretty heavy accent that people can have trouble understanding sometimes. To me, his accent has gotten better over the years (he's been in the US since 2018 ish) but I am not sure if that is just because I have gotten used to the way he speaks. When I asked him if he thinks his accent has improved since he moved to the US he said no or not on a level he can notice. This is the final language scare I got that led to me ending speaking and reading for now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, some days I feel like my Spanish comprehension is pretty good, and other days my Spanish comprehension is pretty bad / way worse. Sometimes I'm understanding so much of something it really surprises me and fills me with a sense of pride. Other times however I am understanding so little it makes me feel pretty bad. I guess I notice this most when watching TV shows (I recently watched all of Castlevania on Netflix and would be at very high levels of comprehension in some episodes and very low in others). I was wondering if this was something other language learners face? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for taking the time to read, I'd love anyone's input on this matter. Am I being too irrational by not speaking or reading? Or am I justified in my idea of holding off speaking and reading until I have more listening hours in and have a firmer grasp on the sounds of the language? Thanks again!

languagelearning,C2 listening…,"Has anyone actually gotten to a point where they genuinely follow at least 99.9% of what they hear, without having to replay what they’re hearing or ask the speaker to repeat or whatever? 

Spacing out is excusable, I do that in English all the time. Talking to natives that even other natives struggle to understand is another excusable situation.

But I mean, like, zero genuine comprehension issues for the vast majority of your average native’s speech. Truly native level comprehension. Like it feels like you’re listening to L1.

(I know, this is such a vague question because native level comprehension is such a vague term, but still, try to answer the question.)

If you feel like you’ve gotten there or gotten quite close, can you share what it required you to get there? I want to get there, and it drives me nuts that I just…. Idk, my listening skills are actually really good, just not like super mega ultra good, nomsay’n?

I feel like only people who are learning English have excellent chances of getting there due to English being so heavily used in so many sectors of life and especially those areas where people are trying to get ahead in life. I’m trying to get there with Spanish, and I just….

I know Spanish in particular is notorious for being especially difficult in terms of listening comprehension, with natives having difficulties understanding other natives, and I’ve heard of people learning both Spanish and non-Spanish languages that find that listening comprehension is noticeably much in non-Spanish languages, often getting to native-like levels much more quickly and easily. I guess the softened consonants and high speed of Spanish is killer.

Regardless of what languages you’ve learned, I’d like to hear how long it took until you felt your listening comprehension in each language genuinely fit the C2 description: “I have no difficulty in understanding any kind of spoken language, whether live or broadcast, even when delivered at fast native speed, provided I have some time to get familiar with the accent.”

languagelearning,Good tutors that don't master grammar,"There's this little thing I've been struggling with lately : I've been taking tutoring classes with a Colombian tutor to learn spanish through conversation and comprehensible input, and I feel like compared to other tutors I have I've really managed to progress a lot with him.

However, there's one thing I struggle with : sometimes I'll ask him something grammatical that bugs me and he'll give me a half-relevant answer that seems to circumvent and avoid the question (for example, today I asked why some spanish verbs are directly connected to the infinitive like 'tengo que lograr entender este examen' whereas others need a 'de' like 'acabo de escribir mis respuestas' and he just gave me a vague description of 'de' as a preposition of origin and content/material which doesn't work with verbs).

The problem is I can't bring myself to tell them that that wasn't the point of my question because I don't want to bring about the awkward situation of making them admit they don't master that part of the grammar.

I guess what I'm asking is do you think a tutor can still be a good source of learning despite not knowing the nooks and crannies of grammatical rules or I should look for a more academically well versed one ?",1626905442,IMakeInfantsCry,12,214,1228,37,6

languagelearning,"Persian ""synonyms,"" and bookish vs. colloquial vocab","Hello! (crossposting from r/farsi)

I've been studying Persian for quite some time, but I'm at a point now where I'm having to grapple with tons and tons of ""synonyms."" Part of this wealth of synonyms seems to be that some words are considered ""bookish,"" by speakers, i.e. only used in writing or in very formal registers, while others are used more commonly in day-to-day situations.

For example, another Persian learner here said a while ago that for the verb ""to try,"" it would be common to use تلاش کردن or سعی کردن, whereas the verb کوشش کردن would sound ridiculous in a casual setting – only in formal writing would one see that verb.

My issue is that I don't really have any way of knowing for sure which words are ""bookish"" and which are acceptable for casual conversation, unless I were to ask a Persian speaker. But I'm dealing with hundreds of such words. I try to read Persian instagram comments or memes to get a feel for the colloquial language, which does help, but just because I see one word being used more often than another doesn't mean I can simply conclude that the other synonyms must be ""bookish."" Maybe I just haven't seen them being used yet, or they have a slightly different connotation.

So, does anyone know of any Persian dictionaries, thesauruses, or other resources that mark when a word is ""bookish,"" or at least go into a bit more detail on the connotations a word has when compared to its other synonyms, so I can at least know if/when some of them are essentially interchangeable? It doesn't have to be Persian &gt; English, even a Persian &gt; Persian book would do. Any other tips/guidance you have is welcome. I'd love to know whether/when to use پایه، اساس، بنیاد، پی، or موسسه for ""foundation"" or دانش، علم، معرفت or شناخت for ""knowledge"" for example.

(Btw, I know some here may say ""don't waste time on this, just learn the words you hear most often and the rest will come as it may,"" and I know that's sound advice, but being able to identify and mentally separate the vocabulary of these two registers is a personal goal of mine.)

languagelearning,Is it better to learn a language with a group of learners or individually?,"All other things being equal, assuming you are learning a language from scratch and seeking to get to a B2/C1 level is it better to learn it on a one to one basis with a dedicated tutor or in a formal group setting with multiple learners of equal ability? In particular, which approach works best if you're learning in a less immersive environment (for example, not studying in your target language country). I've attempted to find research into this online but to no avail.

On face value both approaches have benefits and drawbacks - the former you have more one to one time with a tutor and a more bespoke learning environment, however a lack of peer learners to share study or motivation with as well as an approach that's typically far more expensive.

The latter is more commonplace and a more traditionally ""academic"" learning path where you're likely receive a more generalist teaching, and are splitting time with your tutor between other students. However, you also have peers at a similar level of ability to study and practice with, share resources, methods etc.

I have made a commitment to learn Spanish (Latin American) and am looking for good online tools.  I am immersing myself as much as possible by watching TV and movies only in Spanish with Spanish subtitles along with only listening to the radio/music in Spanish, but I want some instructional tools.

I started using Duolingo, but it just seems so basic, and there's a lot of repetition of things I feel aren't exactly useful other than learning vocabulary words.

Any suggestions?

Any recommendations on materials (videos/radio/movies/shows/cartoons) to hear Indian and Nigerian English? It's for my job, I am trying to train my ear to familiarize myself with speakers from those areas.

Any type of materials are fine, but since that's very broad when it comes to YouTube: I  subscribe and watch a few Indian cooking shows on YouTube so if anyone has a Nigerian cooking channel to recommend, that would be great. Calisthenics, yoga, travel vlogs, and general news channels are good too.

my parents are originating from Vietnam, but i was born abroad. Besides speaking casual vietnamese, i have no idea of ""basic"" grammar or vocabulary. So i wanted to get a ""learn Vietnamese A1/A2 book"" but wanted to ask around, whether people have a go to book for that matter (e.g. in japanese it would be Minna no nihongo or genki afaik). Id prefer a book which is based on some guidelines (like those reference levels) so that i also know where i stand with my currrent knowledge.

I tried duolingo for a while, but it did not feel right (learning with duolingo and the sentences as well). Also tried tandem and ofc speaking with my parents. It seems like i enjoy learning with a basic structure, which is hopefully provided by the book. Although it is not my mother tongue, i would assume i can also learn with english resources.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently learning Japanese, and I'm going through my immersion phase!

I would like to know if you knew a way to do passive immersion without actually storing files on my phone. For example, a website similar to youtube for audio content where I could upload the audio of my anime/movies/radio show/whatever, and then just connect myself and let it run in the background, just like Spotify would do for example.

&amp;#x200B;

I could do that directly on my phone but I'm a bit afraid that all my audio content would take a lot of storage, and I like the idea to be able to continue my playlist whether I am on my phone or my computer.

It’s literally 50% flirting and 50% “hi’s and i’m-doing-great’s followed by 👻👻”. The app is also literally built like a dating app, with shirtless dudes everywhere. Plus it doesn’t help that the inconsistency of replies make it almost impossible to have an actual conversation. Some will be instant, and then followed by a reply &gt;1 hour or even a day later. (It might just be a pet peeve of mine, but i don’t like sudden ghosting when we are literally in the middle of a conversation)

I can honestly tell when someone is trying to improve (which i really do appreciate), when they give more than one worded answers and actually try to engage. But in apps like these, i don’t get people want to get out of it when they don’t put in any effort at all. 

This is an example of an interaction i had: it started with the basic small talk before we decided to start practicing our languages. He starts off with a very
butchered introduction of a VERY BASIC PHRASE in chinese (“ni hao wo okay” is what he said). To which i wrote 2-3ish paragraphs correcting him. He says, “ohh okay” and the next thing i know, HE’S NOWHERE TO BE SEEN. Huh???? 20 minutes of fucking small talk for that?? Even from his perspective, what did HE get out of the conversation??

On the bright side, i have started to cherish the friendship i have with my spanish exchange partner, who i was too lucky to meet, even more. As for now, i’ll delete the app and stick to consuming german media, while skipping the talking for now...


Anyways, please tell me i’m not alone with my hatred for apps like these haha if you guys have stories i’d love to hear them!",1626804883,AliceInPains919,20,351,1922,40,6
languagelearning,Do I start from zero or do I focus back to past years studies.,"I am currently 27 and unemployed for ages, I am now actively trying not burn my brain cells with videogames and similar addictive stuff that I realized to be even more dangerous during pandemic and lockdowns. I am reading more, going out in the open more often, and so on.

My background in language learning is kind of a diversified one, if I can say so myself.  
I have a C1 Advanced in English, I can positively say I am more confortable with English than Italian itself, everything I do and ""consume"" is around 1/10 in my native language.  
A good Spanish level from my school days that I kept reading/listening through the years (a bit rough on vocabulary, due to the inactivity on the speaking side, but fine understanding it).   
A bit of Japanese's basics I studied when I was at University before quitting studies (mostly sillabaries and elementary grammar).  
Same goes for French, which I tried as a self-thought experience some years ago, but quickly stopped the process due to more urgent things.

Now, putting aside my still standing interest in Japanese (language and culture as well) but not avoiding a serious comeback, I am dubious about what to choose between :   
\- Going back to Spanish and dive deeper than my past school days, and always fun;   
\- Give French another shot, I love the musicality of it;   
\- The new entry would be German, which I understand is a challenging one but maybe easier than Japanese considering it is more on the Latin side, therefore my curiosity.

I am mostly interested in some suggestions or experiences in the decision making process, and if you find necessary to have some kind of certificate/degree to demonstrate your level (for future job purposes for example).

Something about the language itself changes the way they communicate, due to its structure, vocabulary, etc. I'm not a linguist or a neuroscientist or anything like that, but it makes a lot of sense to me. 

I'm interested in exploring this aspect of language, and in learning how different languages may change my self expression. however, like most second language learners, my second language is first run through a mental translator into my native language. It is subconscious and uncontrollable. 

Do you ever get to a point where you aren't doing that? where even your thoughts naturally come to you in another language? I have a really strong internal monologue and I sometimes wonder if it sort of hinders my second language development, because even the way I THINK is totally dictated by the laws of the language I speak. I'd love to someday find that I've been thinking in my second language, without having to TRY to think in my second language. I'd love to someday not mentally translate between the two, to not hold them both in my head at the same time when trying to read, listen, write, speak, and most importantly, think!",1626789612,waking_dream96,50,274,1604,140,24

languagelearning,Language Learning Pro Tip For Naturally Reviewing Rare Words: Read Poetry,"Poetry is underrated nowadays as a language learning media source, and I have always thought of it as one of my secret weapons:

* SHORT: most poems are **short**. If your attention span is limited, they're a great way to get manageable daily reading in from a native source, even as a beginner
* MEMORABLE: poems are designed to be memorable. Remember: songs are--if done right--poems set to music. And we know how catchy song lyrics are
* VOCABULARY: the underrated tip for intermediate/advanced learners. Two stanzas of even a mediocre poem will often naturally review 3-5 words that it might take you (without exaggeration) 3 to 5 *entire books* to encounter once
* THAT STILL REPEATS: And if you read a collection of poetry? Poets, despite having huge vocabularies, still have their ""favorite words."" So you will often find 2-3 extremely rare words repeated across 5-6 poems, providing valuable, native sentences to mine that would otherwise be difficult to find

And sometimes the words are repeated within the same poem! A recent example: ""Raúl"" by Francisco Contreras, a wonderful Chilean poet. I read this stanza:

Los soberbios suntuosísimos palacios (The sumptuous palaces, regental)  
De portadas blasonadas y triunfales (With portals emblazoned and triumphant)  
Se perfilan en los fúlgidos espacios (Outlined in fulgent spaces)  
Coronados de diamantes siderales (Coronated by diamonds, sideral) 

And thought, ""Wow, you don't run across 'blasonado,' 'fúlgido,' or 'sideral' everyday."" Except that if you keep reading for 19 stanzas, you encounter this:

Una hermosa virgencita pudibunda (A beautiful, pure virgin)  
De cloróticas pupilas siderales (Of chlorotic, sideral pupils)  
Que reflejan del azur la luz profunda (That reflect the azure's profound light)  
O el metálico fulgor de los puñales (Or the metallic fulgor of a dagger)

""Siderales"" and ""fulgor"" (the noun for ""fúlgido""), just in time to be reviewed and remembered. (And three stanzas after that you read this line: ""La que tiene por blasón un lis de plata,"" repeating the noun form of ""blasonado."")

languagelearning,Is it true that English and Spanish are the easiest languages in the world?,"Is it true? I can't speak much about Spanish, since I've never learned it, altough I've seen it mentioned as the easiest language several times. Same for English. The grammar is not particularly difficult. The spelling is hard because you have to learn how to pronounce each word. There are a lot of sounds which can't be found in my native language. Eg I can't differentiate v and w from each other. Word order still causes me problems sometimes. The vocabulary is very big. And there are 12 tenses, altough only a few of them are used in everyday life. But they can be confusing, like past tense vs present perfect. As I noticed learning the basics is relatively easy, but reaching an advanced level is much harder. I can understand most English texts, but if I have to write by myself I make tons of mistakes. (When I was writing this post, I accidentally spelled ""they"" as ""day"".

languagelearning,Learning words with Anki. Just want some opinion.,"&amp;#x200B;

I have been recently thinking of how best to encode information in Anki. I want to ask for me, who is studying Japanese, and my friend, who is studying English.  We're both advanced.

Words- There are simple words(nouns and simple actions etc) and there  are complex words. I'm thinking of continuing with recognition cards, but also including a sentence with context: my own story that I have built after reading the definition and a few examples, or an example from a native media.  In both cases I'll try to understand how the word fits the situation. If there are other definitions of the word, Ill make other notes. For production, I want to use Close cards with media more often. One problem that I have faced is that I didn't properly 'encode' the word. I tried to encode a rough meaning. Remembering entire sentences will take too much time. And remembering definitions is painful, and often even the best dictionary definitions don't capture the context the words are used in.

I read articles by some people suggesting making cards with a few words(somewhat known words + new words). But it will increase review time, and can increase failure rate and redundancy. Actually, I tried it earlier this year but couldn't succeed. Maybe because I was trying to remember entire sentences in a manner which was not n+1. Instead, I feel that it would just be fine to create separate cards when required.",1626767686,workr19,1,243,1418,49,8
languagelearning,What language to learn based on my interest?Posting here for more answers,"

So I like **Polish** because it’s a bit like Russian but softer and sounds like French in a way.So it sounds nice because it’s a mixture of both since to me Russian sounds harsh to me at times.

I like **French** because it sounds fancy and mysterious.The reason I got inspired to want to learn this language was because I heard a video game character speak it and sounded cool so that made me want to learn French.


**Ukrainian** is cool but I’m learning it because it sounds softer than Russian and if I was to ever go to Russia I would like this language because it’s not harsh and sounds unique compared to how I hear other languages.

&gt;###I’m wanting to learn these not because they are a  necessity but because they seem interesting and fun.Although in the future I feel like Europe would be an intriguing place to visit I only know English so I don’t know if that matters and from North America.

languagelearning,Anki helped a lot in the beginning stages but I realize why it's not as effective for me later on.,"When I first started studying Japanese and Korean, I put every single vocabulary word to SRS like Memrise and Anki. I was progressing at lightning speed because I'm able to retain words significantly better than without SRS and it ensured that I don't forget vocabulary.

When I started getting to intermediate and advanced levels, my retention rate isn't as good, a lot of cards ended up being leeches due to the number of times I mess them up, and eventually the review piles up so much. I knew a lot of vocabulary but the problem is I couldn't pull them out when I need to.

Now I realize why it's not working as effectively for me. In the beginning stages, the words I put into SRS are basic and very common words. I encounter and use them often enough. Like the vocabulary words for common food, common adjectives, verbs, etc. The Anki reviews help enforce these vocabulary. But when I get to much higher levels, the vocabulary is not something I'd encounter as often and when I look at my stats, I realize that I encounter these words much more times in Anki than in actual material I read or listen to. It's easier to drill basic level words into SRS because you're more likely to retain basic information and vocabulary you're more likely to use than obscure one off words. No matter how much I try to optimize the Anki algorithm, the brain would just put on low priority words that aren't very important. The Japanese word for portable shrine they use in festivals is not something I'd need to know or not something I'd think about every day. It's much harder for higher level words and the only real way to absorb them is to encounter them many times in different contexts and that's not something that can simply be forced on you. You might be able to force some words in your brain with enough drilling but there's a clear limit.",1626764446,InsomniaEmperor,9,334,1841,98,20

languagelearning,"It's OK, depending on the way you use Anki, to spend a considerable amount of time not only reviewing your cards, but also creating them.","A few days ago I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/olqsjg/you_are_probably_spending_too_much_time_doing/) and I immediately started comparing the way I use Anki with the usage there recommended (which I thought was reasonable, just different from my own). So I thought about writing this up to let people know that there are other ways to use the program, which may not be as ""efficient"" when compared to the more popular approaches, but can be just as fun, if not more. Beyond fun, I think it can be more constructive for language learning in general.

In my experience, the notion of making your language learning more ""efficient"" (and this efficiency is almost always related to speed, not necessarily quality) is commonplace in the sentence mining oriented language learning circles, and its desirability is most of the time taken for granted. The thing is, I don't really know if I agree with that notion all that much. Surely many people must be in a hurry to learn, because they've got places to go and people to talk to. But I don't think I'd be mistaken if I supposed that most of us do not fit into that category. 

Why should we make things more efficient, and not more interesting? From my point of view, the ""efficiency"" approach to language learning is detrimental to the activity itself. That's why I think that language learning should lean more to the side of a ""patient"" activity, rather than an efficient one. I think that being patient is more rewarding in the long run than being efficient. Sure, you can ""become fluent"" faster with the latter, but I've been thinking, inspired by [this other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/on2d2f/i_have_no_desire_to_ever_be_fluent_i_just_want_to/), is fluency really what we desire most when we start learning languages?

So, what does Anki have to do with all of this? It's really simple: I propose a ""patient"" approach to Anki. Don't worry about making your card creation more efficient. Don't worry about creating decks with tens of thousands of words, sentences or whatever. Don't worry about adding to your deck 20 words, sentences, or whatever a day from your ""immersion"" — a word I think is used in a kind of loose way. I mean, what even is ""immersion""? Seems to me to be just a romanticized way to say ""doing whatever it is that you normally do in your TL"". Don't worry about meeting a set number of cards in a set amount of time. **Don't worry about spending ""too much time"" in your reviews**. I know this bold phrase seems contradictory. Let me explain.

If you take the ""patient"" approach to Anki, you won't worry about creating the **absolute best** **and most efficient** Anki cards, you will just make whatever seems reasonable to you. You won't worry about creating ""easy to review"" cards, you will put on the back side of your cards whatever information you feel like will make you understand the meaning of that word better, even other words, contextualized words, words you still don't know, but that will make sense in that context; words like antonyms, synonyms, heterosemantic words or whatever (and this applies to both beginners and advanced learners the same, I do this with cards written only in my TL). You won't worry about adding 10, 20, 30 cards a day to your deck. You will add whatever number of cards you feel like. I add 2, 3 cards a day. Sometimes I don't make new cards at all. But when I do, I spend 10 minutes making a single card. And when I review those cards, I spend whatever amount of time I feel like reading them, because it's just **fun** to be reviewing them. Reviewing the tips and notes I wrote on that card. Seeing similar words, different words. Words I don't remember and look up when I don't. It's fun to read the sentences I put on the back of those cards. Anki, and language learning in general, doesn't have to be something of which you trim off the bad parts, because depending on the way you face it, there are no bad parts. 

There is this notion going on around language learning circles that Anki is boring and that ""immersion"" is what really defines the learning process, and that therefore, you should minimize the amount of time you spend with this ""fake language environment"", this ""crutch"" that Anki is, and maximize the amount of time you spend with the ""real language"". I don't think there is such a thing. Language is everything. There doesn't exist a single thing in this world that doesn't go through language. If you think of it like this, I'm sure Anki won't be a drag. For that matter, nothing will. Just take your time. Do whatever you feel like. Do it slowly if you want to. I create cards that take me a minute to read fully. So what? It's not a problem. Languages are complex. Why should learning them be any different? Why should it be fast, efficient, straightforward, ""optimized""? Too many cards to review in a day? If that happens even when you create just a few cards a week, oh well, better do it when you feel more like it. Go do something else. Is reviewing Anki your religion or something?

People will say ""Oh, but I *have* to learn 10,000 words before I can start enjoying my TL"". Oh, you *have to*? I'm sorry to hear that, really wouldn't want to be in your shoes.",1626740976,chungkng,1,912,5268,137,25

languagelearning,Here's how many words and how much time you need (probably)," Hello all,  


I posted something quite like this many years ago on the old HTAL forum, and since then I've revised my ideas and wanted to share it with you all. There seems to be many people, myself included, who want some kind of measurable idea about how many words and how much time is likely needed to reach a specified level (according to [the CEFR scale](https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168045bb52)) in a language. Well, here's my attempt to answer that question. Keep in mind, I've only studied Indo-European languages and so can only assume that this scale applies to that family and more distant languages from these likely require significantly more time. Also very important, the ""how many months"" question assumes effective, dedicated studying for a *minimum* of 2 hours per day, every single day for the given time frame. Obviously, failing to meet that target will result in slower progress. The word count also assumes higher frequency words, eg. knowing 500 words about botany isn't going to meet A1 criteria. Alright without further ado, here's my two cents.  


Words known per level:  


A1 - 500  
A2 - 1000  
B1 - 2000  
B2 - 4000  
C1 - 8000  
C2 - 16000  


Time needed per level:  


A1 - 1 month  
A2 - 2 months  
B1 - 4 months  
B2 - 8 months  
C1 - 16 months  
C2 - 32 months  


As you can see, each level for both categories doubles the previous total. I don't have a scientific basis for this at all so it's based purely on my own experience and the experiences I've heard from other learners. Nonetheless, hopefully it gives the obsessive among us something to aim for.",1626738529,GandwolfTheGrey,13,277,1657,59,11

languagelearning,For those who have taken upon themselves to learn Persian-what is the most difficult part for you?,"For me it's partly reading,mostly speaking Vs writing knowledge
So,since my first Lingua is Bulgarian, reading the perso- Arabic script can be nothing short of a clustefuck at times. Say what you think,but imo Persian should adapt to a modified version of the Avestan alphabet for one little thing which flips the table-they write their fucking vowels. Plus,I hate these odd letter‌s like اً. Right when I think I can read a smth no sweat of these mosquitoes pops into existence to spin my eyes 180. Not to mention the Arabic loan letters. Like why in the ever living fuck are we keeping them? They only do two things. First,they confuse newcomers (ط is pronounced identically as ت,for example). Second,they only appear in Arabic loanwords-a fact which doesn't seem to be widely taught,since I had to rummage through the Internet to find out.  

As a person of Afghan heritage,I have decided to learn Dari. Problem is that some words are spoken and written like the difference between a Macedonian and a Bulgarian. For example: (I) don't want: spoken namehoiom,written namehwoham. I am still a beginner,but I have seen such bullshit here and there,so I am expecting more to come at me as I progress.",1626736448,gogogozoroaster,8,204,1199,98,17

languagelearning,Should I study abroad with my school in Canada for 3.5 months or take a year language course?,"

Im unsure which is the best decision for me and here’s why. My plan was to study abroad, I have been saving up for over half a year I have just over 6000USD so far, and will be departing in march next year. I know I still need twice that much, but I still have money left in my tuition so that isn’t a problem as well when I go i will be selling my car (+$3000). As well i will be working full time for 3 months before that. 

I really only want to go so I can learn japanese and live in japan. But i do need to finish my degree, or at least still get one. If i were to go to a language school it would be next April so around the same time.  And from what im learning the price isnt that much more. If i do go to a language school, what i would want to do is continue my post secondary education at a japanese university having a major in japanese. If i were to say pick going to a language school what schools are best for their price as well cheaper living areas. What do you think is the most possible and beast outcome for me?

languagelearning,How people self studied languages in the 50s/60s. (Korean language vinyl record),"So, I saw this on eBay and thought it was interesting. I imported it from Australia. 

Actually, I was pretty impressed with it. It has very practical phrases related to travel, and a pretty decent dictionary. The romanization is terrible - but honestly, no worse than the modern way Korean words are romanized. 

It's interesting where they show Korean writing. It's primarily Chinese characters. So, I imagine in 1964 many Koreans were still illiterate in Hangul. Some words are not used as much anymore. I assume they are based on Chinese. So, it's not exactly up to date, but most expressions should still be understood by Koreans. As someone who has studied Korean for 3 years, I understood most of it without any issues. 

The speaker's voice is very clear on the record. Only Korean words/phrases are spoken. So, you would need to have the booklet handy to study. Everything is only spoken once, so you would need to be moving the tone arm back and forth constantly on each section if you were truly trying to memorize everything. 

Interestingly, the label on the record is backwards. Side 1 and 2 are reversed. Only record I have that I have ever noticed that on...

Anyways, I thought this was a cool piece of language learning history and wanted to share. 

I also ordered the Vietnamese edition. I'm worried the booklet won't be included with it, which will make it pretty useless to me. I also bought several ""Learn a Language"" courses that were sold in a lot super cheap. They are on 4 records each.

languagelearning,"For years I held off on learning Spanish because I felt I could never do it the ""best"" way. I have finally figured it out. The best way to learn a language is the way that works for you and that you will stick with doing. Doing anything is better than doing nothing.","Like many people, I took a language in highschool (french) but never really got into it. After highschool I moved out of my small town and realized how common Spanish really is and wanted to learn. I googled ""what's the best way to learn Spanish"" and instantly was thrown into the discussion and research people on this sub constantly fight over. There was no solid conclusion, but some things I remember were ""immersion and speaking with natives"" which wasn't possible for me, ""buy this $300 software, classes, private tours, subscriptions to apps"" again, no I'm poor af, ""practice for hours every day"" I'm a college student I don't have that time right now. I found Duolingo, a free app that lets you practice a few minuets every day. Then I googled it and of course everyone says it's terrible. So, after hours and hours of searching I just concluded it wasn't possible and gave up.

COVID happened and I decided to pick up a hobby and picked Spanish. This time I said I'll try the ""best"" method that's also free. On the advice of people in this sub I downloaded Anki and started with the 1000 most common words, I started trying to read a book in Spanish, and tried watching a show with Spanish subtitles and realized ""holy fuck I hate doing this"". I didn't feel like I was really learning and the constantly pulling up worlds in the dictionary was giving me a headache. Again, I gave up. 

Now this summer I said ""fuck it"" and decided to just do what I want and give it one last shot. I got Duolingo and made a goal of getting one bubble to gold every day. I've stuck with it for two months, not perfectly, but close. I can stumble through basic sentences and know nearly 1000 words. Finally I am actually learning Spanish. Is it the ""best"" and fastest way out there? Probably not. Do I know 990 more words than I used to? Um, fuck yeah I do. I'm really proud of how far I have come, even if it isn't as fast as others, this is the way that works for me. Now that I feel I have a bit more of a basic structure I'm looking at getting a textbook to start getting a more solid explanation of grammar and such. Is that the ""best"" way to go? Probably not, but it's what I want to do. I feel like it's the next step for me.

What happened to learning a language because it's fun? What happened to enjoying education instead of just drilling thousands of flashcards into your head? What happened to ""everyone learns differently""? Not everyone wants to torture themselves sprinting to the finish as fast as they can.

There’s countless languages out there, and I’d rather have basic (able to read script, introduce myself, etc) in multiple than be fluent in just one. 

I think the language learning community as a whole removes a lot of the freedom and fun from language learning. For some people, native fluency is their goal (which is great!) but language learning is not one size fits all. The same way everyone has different motives for learning a language, everyone has different end goals. Everyone’s language journey is their own, and all of them are valid.

**Monday** It seems that with words like chico(boys) and chica(girls) the one ending in o is used for groups of mixed gender. I usually dislike it when languages have male and
female variants of words like actor/actress but Spanish does something with them that I find interesting: novio means boyfriend and novia means girlfriend
but because novio is used for mixed groups, novios can be used to mean something like lovers, not just boyfriends. Today I noticed that padre and madre (father and mother)
can be used in a similar way, so that padres can mean parents. I'm not sure if there is an actual word for parents or not.

**Saturday** When I was learning Japanese I remember thinking how weird it was that they substituted v in foreign words with a b sound, because to me they sounded nothing alike, now
however I'm actually misshearing one for the other quite often, especially in words like debes. I'm also beginning to think that there are no different pronouns for 
second person plural and third person plural, they are both just ustedes, though I'm not sure about this.",1626612595,faceShareAlt,40,304,1880,80,13
languagelearning,"I feel bad about quitting on my teacher, but I think I may need to. Your thoughts?","I signed up for an intensive online program to learn my target language a while back (3 months ago). I still have 7 months left of the program. It entails 1 hour a day of a lesson plus homework, every day of the week.

Since my teacher is overseas, there is a time difference.

I'm really tired of being scheduled for random hours. 

Every single day my one hour lesson time changes due to my teacher's schedule with other students. 

I've done 5 a.m., 6 a.m., 7 a.m., 8 a.m. ,9 a.m., 10 a.m., 11 a.m., 12 p.m., 1 p.m., 2 p.m. and I have even been asked to do 10 or 11 p.m. 

Rarely will I have a lesson at the same time the next day. It is always randomly scattered within the hours I've mentioned above.

I cannot even have a job with such hours.

I have already expressed this to my teacher twice before but at the end of it all, nothing came out of it.

I'm getting to the point where I am just upset and tired of not having a set schedule or at least a less scattered schedule.

Is it bad if I just let the academy know that I no longer want to study. The lessons themselves were decent but it is turning what was supposed to be fun and challenging into a big scheduling issue that has drained me for 90 days.

languagelearning,Feeling a little daunted about getting back into japanese (spoke for 10+ years) because all my friends are still fluent. Tips for getting back into it and regaining fluency?,"I started learning Japanese in kindergarten, and am now 17. I went to an immersion program that went from having half my classes in Japanese during elementary school to a quarter of my classes in Japanese in middle school, and then one class in Japanese in high school. I dropped out of the program when I was 16, which I deeply regret, but I was also suicidal and I wasn't really learning anything at the time. 

Anyway, most of my friends are still in the program, and a few of them also speak Japanese at home (parents who immigrated from Japan). It feels sort of stupid to get back into it (even though it's been like, 20 months, which isn't too long...) because I don't know that I'll regain my fluency since I don't have anyone to consistently speak Japanese with. 

I'm not sure where to start with learning Japanese. My school has their language classes somewhat weirdly formatted, so it's japanese 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, and then intermediate Japanese history and culture and then advanced Japanese history and culture (which I what I took as a freshman and sophomore). I'm thinking about trying to get into the 7-8 class or the intermediate class this year, but since forecasting is already done, I'm not sure how likely that is. 

If I'm not able to do that, what would y'all recommend for resources? I've never had to structure my own education of Japanese so I don't have all the resources. The main things I think I'll struggle with is re-learning grammar stuff, and being able to read kanji.

I had a few rules. 
- It wasn’t supposed to feel like work, so I wrote just before going to bed since I used to write a (“normal”) diary at that time a while back. That way it felt like picking up an old habit, but with a twist. 
- I didn’t want cram in information, again, not work, just fun. Therefore if I felt tired I wrote just as much as I wanted and stopped when I didn’t want anymore. 
- I was allowed to use a dictionary as much as I wanted (even for entire sentences) 

My progress:
In the beginning the majority of the pages was just me writing down words from my translation app. As the days went on I realized that I knew most of the words, I just had to figure out how to put them together. In the end I wrote around half a page without a dictionary and made immense progress! I’m feel so happy and proud over this!! 
I wrote 16 (A5) pages by hand in 7 days (while studying on other aspects as well during the day) after studying my TL for about a year!

 I have a LOT to learn but I am able to understand much more than I expected in writing, or when being spoken to.  The greatest challenge is speaking on the fly without using a chart to be grammatically correct.

 I recently started an Intermediate Italian class to continue to level up my study and skills. 

  Also - follow me to the bookstore as I get an E-reader to read my grammar books on the fly.  I am going the minimalist route. Instead of an IPad full of apps and distractions, the E-reader is a simple way to study on the go.

languagelearning,You are probably spending too much time doing your Anki reps. Here are some recommended settings and my personal techniques for beginner Anki users.,"People spend way too much time doing their Anki reps. My main deck is a frequency deck. I learn 20 new cards a day from it, and it takes me an average of 15 minutes to do ~225 reps (~4 sec/card). It does not take an hour to do Anki. It should not even take half an hour for a beginner. Here's how!

#Grade Cards Quickly

Obviously you grade a card quickly if you know it. But what if you don't know the card?

If I don't know the word after a few seconds, I fail the card. Sure I could spend 15 sec and maybe get the right meaning, but when I see or hear the word while immersing, I won't have 15 sec to remember it. In that time, lines of dialogue will have gone by, and I will either have to rewind the content or try and catch-up. I try and pass/fail a card as quickly as possible - I give myself a brief pause to see if it comes to mind, and if not, I fail it.

It is not a big deal to fail a card. It's actually a good thing - you're telling the system you don't know it very well, and you are telling yourself that you don't know it well. It gives you more practice with the card.

""But won't that increase the time spent doing your Anki reps?"" Good question. The answer is NO. If it takes me 4 seconds to grade a card, if I fail that card 5 times in a session, that's 20 sec. If you were instead to go the slow route and spend 10 sec on that card, you would likely fail it both times, and it would still take 20 sec.

I don't know about you, but back in school when I made paper flashcards, I would drill the crap out of them. Sometimes it took 10 tries to get a card down. I'd rather that process be faster than slower.

#Recommended Settings

I highly recommend using the settings found on this [page](https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-1/c/srs-best-practices). It takes maybe 10 minutes to set-up correctly, and will pay dividends down the line.

The only deviation from those settings I personally use is that I removed leech cards from existing in my deck (set leech threshold to 0). At first I used the leech function as described in the link, but I still felt I needed to learn these words, and unsuspending cards is annoying. So I just completely turned leeching off. This means that no matter how many times I fail a card, it never gets suspended and temporarily removed from the deck.

So far I've had no issues - sometimes what would be a leech card will be stuck in the beginning learn phase for a week or two, but eventually my brain latches on and starts to remember it well and graduates. It is not a big deal to me to fail a card all the time - I accept that every word is remembered at different speeds, some I immediately remember, and some I don't. And because it only costs me 4 seconds a rep, failing a card repeatedly is not a big deal to me. My goal is to learn these words, not boost my ego by having a larger section of Mature cards in my Anki deck.

#Don't Get Greedy

I'll repeat what's in the link - the basic math is that your (daily new cards)x(7)=(Expected daily reviews in 2 weeks)

New Anki users get impatient at first, and learn 100 words on day 1, then 100 on day 2, and then realize too late that they now have 220 reviews due on day 3, and for most of the following week as well.

Be patient. Start slow. Increase by increments of 5 cards every two weeks as desired.

I currently do 20 new cards a day. That's 1800 cards every three months. That's a ridiculous amount. If you were to just halve what I currently do, you would still be learning ~1000 words in three months. And that would take just 7.5 minutes a day at my pace.

#Why keep your Anki time so short?

Because Anki in the language learning process is like eating your vegetables as a child. Some kids really like them, but many don't like it. The smaller amount of time you can make your daily Anki, the more likely you are to do it.

If your daily Anki reps take only 10 min, it's incredibly easy to never miss a day. We can all spare 10 min a day, even on days you feel extremely lazy. You might not be up for watching Target Language TV shows, reading a book, watching a YouTube video, reading a textbook, or any number of things because those all take time. When your Anki time can be done during the commercials of one 30 min TV show, you'll find time to do it.

The less time you spend doing Anki, the more time you have for everything else in your language learning, like the ones I listed in the previous paragraph. And I think everyone wants to spend more time doing those things.

#Okay smart guy, what's your experience doing Anki this way?

I've studied 26/30 days recently. I currently have 1074 (12.76%) mature cards, 581 (6.9%) Young+Learn, 89 (0.19%) suspended (cards that are too easy), and 6660 (79.1%) unseen. I've been using Anki fairly regularly for the past 4 months.

* Learning cards are 71% correct (5697/7944 reps)

* Young cards are 77% correct (6551/8464 reps)

* Mature cards are 81% correct (844/1063 reps)

The rates for learning and young cards are less important than mature cards . Most people recommend that as long as your mature cards are at least 80%, then keep pushing on.

As I said at the top, on average it takes me 15 minutes to do 225 reps, for a rate of ~4 sec/card. I'd say that's slightly slower than it could be (sometimes I'll get distracted and leave my phone unlocked on the Anki app while I go do something and then come back).

I'd invite you to compare your stats to my own, and I hope this helps some of you!",1626471962,lazydictionary,50,1047,5468,148,24

I was wondering if you could give me some advice about what to do in my situation. I’ve been working on and off with a particular teacher in my TL from iTalki since January.

And then earlier this week, two other lessons I had scheduled with her were canceled by iTalki, and it looks like it’s no longer possible to schedule lessons with her.

However, I currently have a partially used lesson package with this particular teacher and I’m trying decide what my next course of action should be. If she comes back to iTalki, I’d like to actually use those lessons, but if she’s not coming back, I’d like a refund for the lessons I can’t use. I already messaged her over iTalki to ask what was up, but haven’t heard back. I guess my question is: how long should I wait for a response before asking for a refund?

languagelearning,I need your help. I can't properly communicate in my native language anymore.,"Hi, I think I'm facing a bit of a unique issue right now. I have been debating for the last several months about whether I should write this post or not but here we go. In short, I have lost the ability to properly communicate in my own first language and, frankly, I don't know what to do to get it back.

I was born and grew up in Belgium speaking and learning French at school (and Dutch, but that's not relevant) and with friends and Italian with my parents (both immigrated in Belgium in they late 20s) so I have always been a perfect bilingual, although some words usually came easier in one language or the other. I only started studying English when I was about 13 and I just couldn't manage to do it, at school and struggled for several years. One day, however, everything kind of clicked and I have been learning English by myself ever since to the point of reaching a certified C2 level a few years ago.

From 2019 to 2020, I moved to the Netherlands and almost exclusively spoke English with everyone except my partner, who only speaks French, with whom I had a long-distance relationship for the duration of my stay. This is when things started going downhill.

I gradually started to lose my ability to properly communicate in French using subtleties, clever play on words and so on to the point where what I say often leads to arguments, due to miscommunication. I even go as far as stuttering and blanking out for several seconds, desperately trying to find a specific word or a synonym. Generally, I end up panicking and completely losing my train of thought, therefore angering my partner. When I was younger, I used to simply speak in both French and Italian at the same time with my parents because they speak both but in this case I just can't use the same technique. I used to be as good with words as my partner but now it feels she's dating someone who can barely communicate.

I gradually dialled back several aspects of my life in French but the ease with which I used to communicate still hasn't come back, more than a year after I came back. I suspect that part of the problem is the way in which sentences are built in English, which seems to be much more intuitive to me.

I feel like I've started shutting myself down in this relationship because of my inability to properly communicate and frankly I need your help so please, if you have any suggestions, please, don't hold them back.",1626453267,BelgianWaffle97,6,442,2416,77,13

The world is managed by languages. The ones that control the world have spoiled our mind. Once the whole world spoke one language, now unknown to the comman person. This is at present only spoken by those in power. (e.g: Bill Gates, Wladimir Putin, Xi Jinping etc.) 
They and their ancestors have rid our mind of our mother tongue and infested us with these inferior languages made for simpletons. 
They control the world in secret sending messages in this original language. Let‘s wake up and take back what was once ours. It is our birth right to speak this tongue!

This is all based on facts. Example:
In Italian for the past absolute you have 1st conjugation (infinitve ending: -are) 3rd person plural ending: arono, then 2nd conjugation (-ere): erono and 3rd conjugation (-ire): irono.

 There is no right or wrong!! I'm simply curious and want to know what other people are doing.

* How much time are you spending on passive learning materials (e.g. reading articles, watching shows/news, etc...)?
* How much time on active learning?
* Do you blend the two together and use articles and media as sources for vocabulary and note them down? 
* How often are you using ye ol' translation applications for words? Is there any specific translation extension or app you really recommend? (doesn't matter the language)",1626427760,kurijam,2,179,1127,81,11

languagelearning,"I got private beta access to GPT-3, the most powerful language model ever. What AI-assisted language learning tool/site would you like to see built?","I recently had my application to access GPT-3, the most advanced machine learning model developed to date, approved. It was trained off hundreds of gigabytes of data off the Internet and is capable of a wide range of tasks such as essay and short story writing, text summarization, Q&amp;A, code completion, chat and so on.

For more examples and an explanation in order to gain a fuller picture of its capabilities I suggest [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8psgEDhT1MM&amp;vl=en) or going to the [official site’s examples](https://beta.openai.com/examples).

With this in mind, what sort of GPT-3 driven language learning tool ideas/wishes do you have? I’m excited to use this technology and would like to create something useful for language learners such as myself with it.

---

Some notes on AI and personal limitations:
- GPT-3 can ‘speak’ a number of languages, but its capabilities are roughly related to the popularity of the language. English is excellent, along with Spanish and French to a lesser extent, but there are grammar and syntax trip-ups beyond that. I’m thinking of mainly using the English and Spanish models with DeepL + human oversight for other languages to have maximum quality.
- I am happy making command-line (terminal) tools, browser extensions, and websites, but will be unlikely to dive straight to developing a mobile app due to cost and unfamiliarity.
- Being one person, the monetary investment I can make into developing this is very limited - while I have the time to train my own model, code the entire UI myself, etc. I simply don’t have the resources now to sink thousands of dollars into expensive fine-tuning of GPT-3, paying for human translation, etc.",1626401661,LAcuber,8,274,1709,148,24

I'm looking for suggestions for a good learning platform for Danish that is laid out similar to Say Something In.

languagelearning,How do I know when to use a certain form of pronunciation for vowels in Brazilian Portuguese?,"They do not always have accents, so how do I know how it should be pronounced? For example the letter ‘O’ in the word ‘hora’ would be pronounced differently to the first ‘O’ in the word ‘sonho’ Is there a rule to determine this? (I already know an O at the end of a word sounds like /u/ btw).

I found this to be true with the letter ‘A’ also, where sometimes it will have a nasal sound but there will be no accent to indicate that. For example, the letter ‘A’ in ‘amo’ has a nasal sound but the first ‘A’ in ‘amanhã’ does not have a nasal sound yet the one that follows does have one, but I’m not sure how I’m supposed to determine these differences if I was to come across a word I had never seen/heard and I was to just read it and ensure I pronounced it properly solely with my knowledge of phonetics.

I also have it on my desktop to be able to sync community decks. However, the community decks have not been very useful to me because the words seem irrelevant and kind of random and I feel like I would learn more from actually creating the deck myself. After trying to create decks for about 4 days now and deleting all of them, I have found that I'm not actually sure of the most helpful way to use Anki for language learning. I have read multiple guides and reddit posts but none of them have helped too much.

I know that phrases are better to learn because then you learn words in context, but how do I come up with phrases in my TL, which is German, if  I am just starting out and I know nothing.  Also, I have saw that a lot of people like to include audio on their cards. I do not know any native German speakers very well so how do I add audio? I could record them myself but I feel like that's a poor idea because I want to get as close to a real German accent as possible. I also could pronouce a word wrong which could be hard to unlearn in the future.

If I do use Anki for vocab words would you recommend that I create a separate deck for the words and phrases? Also, are frequency lists a good place to get words from?

languagelearning,Strategy for reading :)," Hi,

I've come up with a fantastic strategy for reading native-speaker content :) I'd like to share it with you.

**What to read**

 Read anything you want, but only pick one or two paragraphs to read. I use Klexikon for German ([https://klexikon.zum.de](https://klexikon.zum.de/)) (I've read the article on Mozart and the Duden), and Harry Potter for Spanish. This method works for both online material and paper books!

**Length of time**

Depending on your reading speed, this takes about half an hour to complete.

**Strategy**

1. Read the text out loud. This helps to practice speaking.
2. Read the text in your head. This helps to practice reading comprehension.
3. Highlight any new words and look them up in a dictionary. Write down the words you don't know and their definitions in a table.
4. Read the text in your head once more, this time focusing on unfamiliar words.
5. Translate the text into English. You should have already written down unfamiliar words, so this step helps to recognise grammar structures.

**I hope this helps :) Let me know in this post how you get on.**

languagelearning,Is French or German easier to speedrun?,"I’m a philosophy student going into my third year of four, and I suddenly recalled as I woke up this morning from anxious dreams that I rather want to do a master’s. I live in the UK, and it would cost bank to do it here, so I’m planning on doing it abroad. The options, it seems to me, are either somewhere in France  or somewhere in Germany. 

Now I don’t speak either of those languages fluently, but you need at least a C1 for most courses. I probably have a B1 or so in my German as it’s very much atrophied, although I can still understand it pretty well - I can watch TV shows in it if the subtitles are in German as well, and I sometimes listen to lectures in it and understand most of what is said. On the other hand, I’ve probably actually studied French itself for four days total in my life, but because my main foreign language is Spanish, I can read it no problem and understand it in its more formal spoken varieties. I can probably speak enough to get by right now, but obviously I have to study the grammar in depth and idioms and such like.

Now, I’ll probably need to apply late next year, which means I have a year to get to C1 in either one of them. My question is - which one should it be? I would say that, besides some second hand Francophobia from my Spanish friends, I generally prefer French as a language, and obviously there is the food to consider. On the other hand, my German is probably better as it stands, it’s easier to pronounce obviously, and it’s arguably more important as a philosophical language. Regardless, the important thing it to learn it, and fast, so any tips in that respect would also be much appreciated.

languagelearning,Learning a non-Indo-European language,"I’m a 28 year old native English speaker. I’ve been learning Spanish off and on over the past several years, but started studying more often recently and have made lots of progress. I took an online test a few days ago and got the result B2, though for now I think I fit B1 better. I’m having a much easier time with listening comprehension and recalling words more quickly. It’s nice to find something that I’m enthusiastic about that comes sort of easily to me.

I want to learn a language outside of the Indo-European family at some point. I’m considering Turkish because I like the way it sounds, and there are so many other languages that are partially mutually intelligible with Turkish. But, I would also consider learning another language instead...like maybe Swahili or Indonesian, something that wouldn’t be insanely challenging. It would be cool to learn a language where the vocabulary is mostly unfamiliar to me.

I guess I’m wondering what the learning curve is like for a language outside of your native language family. Does it make any easier to learn a language as an adult if you’ve learned a second language, even if the third is outside of that family? Also, how proficient should I be in Spanish before I start learning Turkish, or whatever else I choose? I don’t want the Spanish I’ve been learning to get shunted to the side by a new different language.

For now I’m occasionally taking the basic Duolingo lessons in Turkish and Swahili (and German, even though it’s Indo-European). My thought is that this way, when I do start focusing more on a new language, I might at least have a few words and phrases that I’m familiar with.

I'm not good at grammar even in English.

languagelearning,Help!! Looking for participants in a study about language-learning in online gaming communities.,"TLDR: MMORPGs and gamer culture offers a LOT of potential for the world of linguistics, education, sociology, and academia in general- help me show how gaming is a unique and worthy time investment by participating in my study!

Hello everyone! My name is Lizzy Naughton, and I am a linguistics student at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, and I'm looking for participants for my study about international gaming culture.

The study will be about how people learn new languages and skills because of their investment into MMO/MMORPG culture. Virtual reality, role play scenarios, immersive storylines, and interaction within the game and outside of the game all all factors that make the MMORPG community ideal for learning complex skills, particularly communicative language skills. My study will aim to be an **ethnographic investigation** into online gamer culture, specifically for those who are gamers who are non-native English speakers playing in a primarily English-speaking environment.

My background is of someone who loves studying linguistics, and who also loves observing how online culture and what gaming culture is changing younger generations.

All I will need is to conduct some personal interviews within the span of 4-5 months, and permission to observe your chat interactions in communicative platforms such as discord, reddit, etc. (This platform will depend on the participant.) The interviews will last no longer than an hour, and I will only need up to three interviews. **All names/ personal information will be kept anonymous.**

I am specifically looking for participants who are 19-years-old and older, who play an MMORPG regularly, and who do not speak English as a native language. English proficiencies do not have to meet a certain standard, but you have to interact in-game or online in *mostly* English.

The study will begin within August. The end goal is to have a **collection of opinions and experiences from non-native English speakers about their experiences as gamers**. What do you like about the community? How do you feel about your English? **We also want to have linguistic observations about how players communicate and chat in discussion-based forums,** looking for signs of code-switching, use of multiple kinds of English dialects, etc.

Please, help me out and reach out!! This will be an interesting and worthwhile experience. The study will help future researchers to understand the nature of MMORPGs and the MMORPG community in the context of globalization, internet culture, and youth culture.

languagelearning,Studying both French and German with experience in the latter,"I need some help with my language learning strategy.

I’ve been learning German for just under a year now. I’ve been studying in a very lazy manner, and as a result my skills are quite lopsided. I’ve pretty much exclusively drilled vocabulary and listened to native content with a bit of reading and basic grammar rules sprinkled in. As a result, while my listening is actually very good at this point, my speaking and writing are comparatively very poor.

Anyway, I want to start studying French, maybe in a more deliberate, well-rounded manner, since I have numerous French speakers in my life. However, I don’t want to drop German completely, because I like the language and have put hundreds of hours into it, so it would be a shame to put all that to waste.

How would you recommend I balance the two? Currently I am drilling Anki decks for both languages (5000 most common French words and Goethe Institute B1 Wortlist, respectively) as welling as doing Assimil French daily, along with lots of active and passive listening for both languages. I want to build a structured routine that will help me make progress in both without getting the languages confused. I’m finding myself recalling German words whenever I drill French vocab or try to say something in French. I also want to brush up on my German weaknesses and maybe start practicing speaking in VRChat or something. Any ideas to put it all together? Should I do both every day, or alternate days?",1626279067,AchillesDKS,0,254,1462,61,10

I mean, unless he/she has a very groundbreaking studying method, every learner's routine is more or less the same old story: hard work, perseverance, etc. And in the case of the OP having a special studying method, he should make a post putting his method as main content, and attach a certificate to prove his success.

Also, certificates are very commonplace. There are thousands of examinees every year for every major language. If everyone posts their certificate, the sub would be drowned with these image posts, and more interesting discussions cannot take place.

languagelearning,What do you prefer for learning a language? IPA or a custom phonetic alphabet?,"I am working in a material for teaching a language where I constantly need to show the pronunciations since the orthography of the language is a bit complex.

That's why it was created a custom phonetic alphabet *(let's call it ""CPA"")* instead of using IPA whose letters are complicated to type in the middle of a discussion in a forum. 

Word | IPA | CPA
:--|:--|:--
swehdos | ['sweː.dos] | {swE:dos}
spreu | [spʀø] | {sprö}
witerom | [witə'ʀom] | {witërOm}
kheiss | [xeɪ̯s] | {qeys}
shinan | [çi'nan] | {xinAn}

*By the way, it was not me who created CPA.*

Another advantage of CPA is that one of its letters might mean two or more sounds, for example:

{o} = [o], [ɔ]
{r} = [ʀ], [ɾ], [ʁ]

So, a word like ""witerom"" admits the following pronunciations: [witə'ʀom], [witə'ʀɔm], [witə'ɾom], [witə'ɾɔm], ...

*But if I were meant to use IPA, I think I could notify people that, for example, [o] may also mean [ɔ]. It's not a big deal, I suppose.*

But time passed, I created tools to phonetically transcribe words to IPA and CPA *(a script that does the job in a web page)*, and the grammars have tons of phonetic transcriptions in CPA. So, I don't think that realistically there will be a need to type phonetic transcriptions in the middle of a discussion since people will already have easy access to the transcriptions.

**So I've started to think whether would be a good idea to drop CPA, and only use IPA. What do you guys think? This is the question of this thread.**

IPA seems to be intimidating with those strange letters and diacritics, but it is an official phonetic alphabet.

The problem is that all materials use CPA, so it would be a huge work to convert everything from CPA to IPA. So, if you guys think that it does not matter which phonetic alphabet is used *(i.e., you don't care)*, then I will stay with CPA, otherwise I will use only what do you think is the best (IPA or CPA).",1626273571,hmslima,12,346,1898,78,14

I'm currently kind of panicked about something. I took Latin 1 online last year, but I forgot around 95% of it. I'm very embarrassed and regretful to say this, but I...uhh...didn't put much effort into it. My Latin 1 teacher was really laid back and our quizzes were all open note, which was why I aced all of them, getting 90-100%. He'd even post the answer keys to the homework so we could reference them before submitting. 

However, now that I'm going back to in-person school next year, I'm really starting to regret this because I'll be taking Latin 2 in the fall and I only have 1.5 months left. In-person school has different teachers, and my new school is known to have amazing Latin teachers. What should I do to catch up? Any tips? Recommended resources? Anything is appreciated. I'm willing to dedicate any extra time I have until the start of the new school year into it.",1626246803,inspiringtheory,0,161,899,29,5

languagelearning,I dislike Duolingo for one reason,"I know there are plenty of videos that roast the faults of Duolingo, but as a beginner langauge learner I find the app very helpful. However, there is one single thing that bugs me: translating from TL to English (for me, that would be Russian).

The reason I dislike this feature is because when I see a Russian sentence or some words that I understand, I understand because I am thinking in Russian. Unless I am translating for someone, I’ll never need to go from Russian into English for anything beyond a word or two. This type of exercise is extremely tiring because, while I understand exactly what the sentence is expressing in Russian, the English words don’t come naturally even if I know the meaning of the sentence. Of course, sometimes I will not recognize the context of a word, and will need to translate it to English, but I only ever need a single word or phrase. 

I don’t mind it the other way around (English into TL) because if I’m writing a lot or speaking a lot, my brain will obviously be thinking in my native language. I simply despise having to rewire my thought patterns of thinking in Russian just to progress in Duolingo.

Is this an issue for anyone else, and how can I get used to mentally translating Russian into English. Also, is there a way to turn this type of exercise off..?",1626203826,enkestankers,20,239,1312,33,6

languagelearning,Should I Switch Teachers/Tutors or am I just Giving Up Too Easily?,"For context, my target language is Tagalog. I am a Filipino born in Canada and I have mediocre to decent skills in understanding/listening because I live in a household with Filipino parents and grandparents who speak mostly Tagalog/Taglish. Although, all my other skills like speaking, writing, etc, are terrible. The thing is, it's just really weird to tell what my actual skill level is. For example, I could know some advanced words but forget or not know words that are so simple. Or sometimes, I can understand a sentence that's being said and I can tell if it sounds grammatically correct or not but I don't understand the reason/logic of how and why it's correct, I just know that it sounds right/natural because that's what I'm used to hearing. Also, just understand almost everything being said to me but not having a damn clue of how to even begin creating a sentence to reply with lmao. My overall goal is to just be able to reach conversational fluency; be able to talk to friends and family with ease in casual day-to-day conversations, and visit the Philippines and be able to communicate with native speakers.

So, with the hopes to improve my Tagalog skills and become conversationally fluent in the language, I ended up scheduling a trial lesson with a tagalog community tutor. She's a nice person and I sort of explained to her my situation and let her assess my skill level and everything was relaxing small talk at first. The teacher then proceeded to jump to teaching me things like pronouns, objective pronouns, formal and casual style sentence/rules, affixes, and adverbs. Throughout this, I was understanding a decent amount of the words she was writing down and saying to me but all the rules, prefixes, suffixes, etc felt like it was too much. The trial lesson ends and even though I felt slightly overwhelmed I decided to brush it off because if I don't struggle then I won't learn and it's only been one lesson.

After the trial lesson, I schedule another lesson and the same thing happens. More rules and new concepts to learn leading to me once again feeling overwhelmed. Towards the end of the 2nd lesson, I talk to her about my level and ask if she thinks I'm good enough to learn all this, and she starts telling me that I'm more advanced and I'm not really a beginner due to my decent understanding and my fast adaptation to pronunciation. But I don't feel that way at all lol, I feel like my understanding of the language and my being accustomed to the sound of native people speaking every day has made me look more advanced than I really am.

The thing is, I actually really like the teacher. She speaks English and Tagalog well, goes beyond the time to further explain more concepts and examples, is always open to questions, and is overall nice. I just feel like I'm too dumb to be her student lol. I also don't want to feel guilty for no longer taking lessons with her since it seems like we're going to continue doing lessons, especially since she always brings up what we will learn about in the next lesson.

I just don't know if I'm giving up too easily, maybe it's my lack of confidence, or am I just not that good and I should switch to a more beginner curriculum style of learning.

Should I switch tutors? Try to talk to her more about my situation (if so how should I go about it?) Or just stop using tutors all in all for now and focus on other things first?

Sorry if this seems like a rant or is a stupid question to ask, I'm new to the language learning world and am just really excited to learn Tagalog, but I'm starting to lack confidence right away which is making me question my own capabilities, especially with not being able to consistently determine my actual skill level and where to go from there.",1626186317,TheGreatScrubini,7,676,3761,66,12

languagelearning,Unable to sign up for HelloTalk on the same device. Looking for language exchange alternatives.,"Hi reddit,

A few years ago, I had signed up for HelloTalk using an old email that I no longer have access to for a language that I’m no longer learning anyway. 

I deleted the app (but couldn’t delete the account), a few months back because I was no longer learning the target language. 

Today, I tried to redownload the app to practice with a different target language and wanted to sign up with my current email address, however when I try, I get an error barring from signing up for a new account as only one account can be registered to a device, and all data is saved on HelloTalk’s database, so I can’t even erase my old account from my device.  When I tried to log in with my old account, it would have some issues as well saying that it wasn’t connected to an email account?

Does anyone have a fix to this, or have any suggestions for other language exchange apps?

languagelearning,Native English Speakers and Language “Parasites”,"Hi, I am American and at a good C1 in Mandarin. To give that context, I use Mandarin to do mental health counseling here in Shanghai. I am having some issues with reconciling that some locals basically only want to have relationships with me (friendships, romantic) if I am willing to speak English with them. I find it to be quite transactional a lot of the time and I really cannot get over my mental block on having relationships with people knowing that a large motive for them is to improve English, and, if they couldn’t use English with me, they would not even consider being my friend. In Shanghai, and China at large, English is considered a sign of social status and educational achievement, so there is a lot attached to it other than novelty. 

I’m wondering how others feel about this when it comes to their second language and native tongue? I am really struggling to get over it and just accept that I am an English-bot at times!

languagelearning,How to produce French sounds in your mouth,"This was one of the replies to someone asking for a way to improve their French pronunciation.

""Remember that most of these sounds are formed forward in the mouth in French, and deeper in the throat in English. When you form French consonants forward in the mouth (think “l” formed on the tip of the tongue as opposed to American “l” formed in the throat) the vowels that are attached to the consonants will form forward in the mouth as well, which is what you’re looking for. Form all of the sounds forward, you won’t need to change your mouth shape as you pronounce, and the vowels will remain pure.""

Can anyone elaborate on the reply? How do you produce sounds forward in the mouth? 

Is there an online course that can teach you how to produce certain sounds in your mouth? 

Theoretically, I understand what he means when he says ""you won’t need to change your mouth shape as you pronounce, and the vowels will remain pure."", but practical application is not easy.
Are there any drills one could do to achieve what the person is advising in his reply?

So I recently finished and audio lecture from the great courses (language families of the world, by John McWhorter) where I learned about diglossia. One of the things that struck me about it was how many speakers in diglossic cultures/ areas often don’t consider their vernacular language a “real” language. 

I volunteer as an ESL tutor, and as fate would have it in my most recent batch of students, I have a guy from Morocco! I met up with him outside of class recently, and he indeed says he doesn’t really think of the Moroccan Arabic (also know as Darija?) as a real language. 

I would love to hear from people from other diglossic areas around the world and see how they think about their vernacular speech/ language. How common is it not think what you speak is a “real” language? Is it just because it doesn’t have a native writing script? Is it more strictly a cultural phenomenon? And if someone’s target language is a part of a diglossic culture, do you just have to try to learn two languages?

I've been studying Korean for a while now, and I'm about to go into college here in America. I've been thinking about possibilities for a job while I'm on campus (I don't qualify for FAFSA's work-study, so I have to get creative) and I had an idea about becoming a translator for some sort of online digital service. I began researching this type of work and was wondering if anyone here had any wisdom on the topic! I'm personally considering it because I believe it could be flexible with a class schedule, give me the opportunity to use my skills, and possibly even help get my foot in the door with being able to go abroad or work with language later, all while looking good on a future job resumé.

Any input on if this is a good idea or not? Anyone done anything like this? Would this be a good job experience for a student, especially one who is hoping to work/study abroad later? Or is this a dumb idea altogether that I should scrap?

(In case it’s pertinent: I’m an overall B2. Mirroring my English skills, my reading &amp; writing are definitely miles ahead of my speaking &amp; listening, which is why I think digital translation would be a good fit; text is my strong suit. I'd probably begin seriously looking for a job like this around winter break, so I'd have time to improve a bit too and get used to a college schedule.

In my late middle school and early high school years, I took 3 Spanish classes, and even though I didn't learn much, I learned a decent amount and want to continue to learn Spanish because of that and also because of Spanish becoming a more widely spoken language here in the US.

languagelearning,What should my side hobby be?Learning Spanish or Learning French?[Please read],"

###Spanish:

I took 3 years of Spanish in Middle school but haven’t studied in *5 years* .I did try to learn through 3 years ago through Duolingo app but it wasn’t the same as learning through the classroom so I became demotivated.I learned on my own because my moms side of her family was half Spanish/half English because I wanted to sound not dumb but lost my motivation a bit for it but at the same time it’s just useful since it’s used a lot.

I know there is feminine, *(Tú,El,Ella,Usted,Nosotros,Yo)*,informal/formal.But I can only speak basic phrases back and understand some of what people are saying in Spanish if it is basic words I heard a lot.

###French:

I never studied this or tried learning this learning, but recently I’ve been trying to find a better hobby than gaming since being on the game negatively affects me.The reason I wanted to learn this language is because it sounds nice and just wanted to learn something new.But I have no experience in it at all.But it seems pretty cool and don’t know y’all’s opinions about it.

##*What should I learn?Spanish or French*

**Info**:_I’m a Native English speaker from the U.S and been debating back and forth between learning these but now I don’t know if I should just resort to learning both at the same time._

languagelearning,"A language to widen my horizons, especially for the Asian continent","I am Brazilian, so **Portuguese** is my mother tongue. I can use **English**, and I am already studying**Spanish**.

English opened a lot of ""cultural doors"" for me, thanks to the language of Shakespeare, now I can access a lot of culture and also high-quality technical materials, not only from anglophone countries, but also from countries of all over the world through the translations of their materials to English. *I am learning Spanish because practically all the countries that surround Brazil speak this language, not to mention that Spanish has a relatively huge relevance in the world*.

I would like to learn one more language, but this one must widen my horizons as English did to me. For example, there are a lot of materials in German, but I suppose that most of them *(I mean the ""relevant"" ones)* are already translated to English, *you can correct me if I am wrong*. I love mangas and animes, but most of them are already translated to English or even Portuguese, that's why I don't think in learning Japanese. All languages have something not translated to English that is worth of knowing, but I cannot learn all of them, so I would like to choose one that would ""unlock"" the biggest amount of culture as possible **that is not available in English, especially from Asian cultures**. What kind of culture? Art in general and technical materials.

Another example to you understand what I want: Mandarin carries a millenary and rich culture from just one country, but does this language would ""unlock"" the other Asian cultures for me that are not available in English? I wanna know more about **East Asia** ***( China, Japan, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea, and Taiwan)***, **South Asia** ***(Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, etc)***, **Central Asia** ***(essentially the -stan countries)*** and **Eastern Europe**; there are a lot of materials about and from these countries that are already translated to English, what other language would **widen even more my access to these cultures**?

-------------------------------------

**I already have some languages in mind, here are my thoughts and I would like to see yours:**

* **Russian:** I think that this one would ""unlock"" the Eastern Europe and good part of Asia, it's what I feel, I have no basis for this affirmation

* **Arabic:** the Arabic world is totally alien to me, what make this choice interesting, but the fragmentation of the Arabic language takes me away from this option. *And I am more interested in the other parts of Asia...*

* **Mandarin**

Does this mean that you shouldn't learn Mandarin? I'd say no. First, the gap in power between Mandarin and the next two languages (French and Spanish) is still pretty large. If China implodes, it's still got a ways to go before dropping down a notch.

More importantly, if China does start to lose ground economically, it could do desparate things to maintain their position. And being able to talk to them might be useful in keeping yourself out of the cross fire.

languagelearning,Learning a language through immersion is slow if it's all you do,"All over Reddit there are people telling you that if you study grammar, phonetics, or anything else you are wasting effort and you should just learn it by consuming native content or shadowing. 

I have ADHD and I did horribly in school. I understand why people are afraid of studying and want to avoid reading about grammar. However, I believe this is based on fear and irrational thinking but some people seem to have convinced themselves it's objectively superior.

Here's an example of why it's not time efficient. I've been taking the Pimsleur Japanese courses, which are audio based, and they keep trying to teach me how to negate verbs by making me repeat the words over and over again in simulated conversations. The vocabulary is just not sticking in my head this way. I'm continuing to use the program because I could use the help with listening comprehension and pronunciation, but other aspects of it could use improvement.

However, yesterday, I found out about [Godan verb conjugation](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/verb-conjugation-groups/) through [this](https://youtu.be/UHo3qUb79No) video. Now, negation seems more simple. For certain verbs you just add an i (い) to it which makes my life a lot easier.

Ultimately, it doesn't matter how you choose to study because everyone will get to the same place eventually. If you reach fluency nobody will care if it took 2 years or 20 years. If your method of studying works for you I'm not saying you should stop. I just don't think there's enough pushback against the immersion school of thinking so I wanted to say this.

""Immersion"" is supposed to mean using the language with native speakers and learning that way. This is definitely a good thing. However, I feel like on the internet with some people, ""immersion"" means then if you talk about studying that language you're elitist and snobby and wasting your time, which is wrong.",1626028059,tesseracts,81,312,1906,64,12
languagelearning,How does stress accent work in English?,"I am a native English speaker, but upon studying other languages that have stress accents (in specific Latin), I realized that I neither understand the concept of a stress accent nor am conscious of it when I speak. I merely regurgitate the pronunciation that I heard as a child and the mere act of regurgitation produces the stress accent. This is also true to a lesser degree in Spanish (as I was partially raised by my Spanish speaking grandparents) as I do not think about this in Spanish either and despite my limited Spanish vocabulary, I seem to get it right anyway without understanding what I am doing. I read that video is different between English and Spanish, and I certainly pronounce it differently in English and Spanish. However, when I was younger, I would just think “it is said this way in one and another way in the other” and years later as an adult, that is still the only explanation for what I am doing differently.

It occurs to me that if I am to learn other languages that have a stress accent, it would be a good idea to learn what the English stress accent is so that I could adapt it to the needs of other stress accent languages. With that in mind, would someone please, either explain or point me in the right direction for how to understand, the English stress accent?",1626026863,ryao,9,237,1301,39,7
languagelearning,I regret learning Dutch,"I regret learning Dutch.

For a year already I've been living in the Netherlands. Before coming here I'd put a lot of energy into learning Dutch and I've reached a level where I'm actually conversational, I only have difficulties understanding natives who speak fast or with an accent.

I'm waiting for a situation where it'd be useful.

Everyone prefers talking to me in English simply because, well, *everyone* speaks fluent English. No, even Urk isn't an exception here. There have been zero situations where my knowledge of Dutch was any help, as everything important is bilingual. Even people who know that I speak Dutch prefer talking to me in English simply because it's more convenient for them.

Of course, ever since the invention of script media became the second, but not less important carrier of culture. The problem is, since everyone in NL speaks English:

1. Foreign content for adults isn't translated into Dutch.

2. Whoever has any success, starts making content in English. There are lots of Dutch international hits, none of them are in Dutch.

###What I did
Watched children's shows I'm familiar with and read simple manga.

###Journal entries

**Tuesday**
Today I was watching One piece as usual with it's subtitles that don't always match exactly but are ok 9 times out of 10. 
Or so they were until now. On episode 67-ish the subtitles suddenly changed and it's now unusable for me, so I guess I won't be using subtitles 
for the foreseeable future. The good news is that while searching for a better site for reading manga, I opened one of them from the most popular list to
see how the site worked, and to my surprise I could actually follow it for the most part. It's called Ijiranaide Nagatoro-san and it's some pathetic fetish thing
that's remarkably easy to follow, perhaps even more so than Yotsuba, and I'm actually enjoying it for some reason, I think I'll read it.

**Wednesday**
My listening is still not as good as my reading but I think that the gap is at a more normal level, so I won't worry about it too much, but still, 
with the loss of One Piece I started putting more care into what I listen to and I found this show aimed at very young children that's called Ben and Holly.
It's not exactly entertaining, but I can actually follow along somewhat so it's still better than watching something where I don't understand the story.

**Friday**
My motivation changes from day to day like I'm on a roller coaster. One day I feel like I'm doing great, understanding a lot of things, but on others it feels like 
the content I'm consuming gets more complicated at a certain point, except that when I look back at the parts I read the day before they also feel the same.
It also doesn't help that I have no idea if I'm doing well or not.

**Saturday**
It feels so good when I finally notice what sets two similar words apart. For the most part I don't remember the words exactly, only as jumble of letters or sounds,
and I usually dont know what sets apart words that sound similar or refer to similar things for example I just figured out that viaje means something like journey and vieja
refers to an old woman. Another set that has been bothering me for a while are the c-nouns for head related things. I think I got it more or less down: cara is face cabezo is head,
cabello means hair. I'm not sure about the last one because there is a very similar c??b??ll?? word that probably means horse. This is even worse with verbs that are a lot more
fuzzy because of the conjugation. But I suppose not knowing the words exactly but being able to recognise them in context is a lot better than being able to write them down in a vocab quiz
but not being able to recognize them.

It's also worth noting that I guess the meanings of new words a lot less often than before. Also I think I've reached the limit of what I can figure out about the grammar and phonetics consciously,
so I've stopped making guesses about those all together. Here is what I figured out so far: The writing is pretty much completely phonetic, the few sounds that I have problems with are
ll and y which may or may not be the same sound, and I think I tend to hear two sounds for y one voiced and the other not, this might just be allophonic. One of the few things that I knew about 
Spanish before this experiment is that it distinguishes between rolled and unrolled r-s which would explain the difference between r and rr, but I speak languages with rolled and unrolled r-s so I think I would be
able to hear the difference between the two but I can't which leads me to doubt my memory. I'm also not sure if the h is silent or not most of the time or if it's just a very soft version of j. 
The vowels are a lot simpler, I'm pretty sure that there are only 5: a i u e and o, but I've seen an ü written down but it only seem to appear in vergüenza and I think it's pronounced as an u there.
Furthermore I'm sure that there are no long vowels and double consonants, even when two instances of the same sound appear at the boundaries of the words they seem to be realized as just one of that sound.
I also know that the ' thingy marks the accent, but unaccented words have this very particular Spanish-y sound that I have no idea what it is, but I'm certain I could replicate it.

About the grammar, I know that nouns have at least two classes el and la, if there are others they must be very rare. It seems to be mostly random which word belongs to which class, but words that end with an o tend to be el
and words that end with a or ion tend to be la. The plurals end in an s. Adjectives can come either before or after the noun they modify and conjugate to match it's gender and plurality. The verbs work very similar to English with the 
added conjugations for the subject and the object. The latter can also be expressed by putting the me/te... before the verb. There are contionuos and perfect tenses and passive voice, probably expressed by ending the verb in do
and putting a conjugated form of estás, he and soy respectively. I absolutely could not make a table for the actual inflections but I think I can more or less recognize them.
It even has helper verbs like tengo and debes which work kind of like have and must/should. 
Relative clauses are right-branching and seem to start with que.

languagelearning,Is it offensive to often speak your relearned native language to yourself/use it as your base language? Is it offensive to use a language for more than conversation? Disagreement with another language learner.,"I have been relearning my native language (Russian) and begin learning Estonian soon (I'm from north east Estonia), but have run into a moral/ethical delimia. I was brought to Canada young to live with a strictly English speaking family, so English is by far my strongest language, especially from how badly I forgot my Russian over the years (relearning now). 


My friend, who is from Canada, is upset with me for often speaking Russian to myself/making it a larger part of my life. To me it is important, because my first years and memories were back home, and the language holds a lot of significance for me. While I understand that I am Canadian, it is very important that I regain this part of myself. 


His view is that as Canadians, it is offensive to make a language  beyond English/French part of who you are unless you have grown up to adulthood in the country of the languages origin. He says it is fine to learn a language, but you should not talk to yourself in this language or tell others you speak it unless they also speak the language. He says it is offensive and minimizes the experiences of people that grew up to an adult age in their home country, and that I am appropriating a culture I haven't belonged to since childhood. For reference, his family has been here three generations, and he has relearned his families origin language, but never speaks it unless with someone else that does. His view is that anything beyond this is deeply offensive. He says I am embarrassing myself.


I'm wondering, how do others feel about this? I will not stop trying to relearn my native language, but maybe it is a good idea if I draw back on expressing myself in this language (a lot of my ticks are still in my first language). It is an interesting conversation, because I suppose I can understand his view? He is deeply educated, very much more so then me, so maybe he has a special insight?

languagelearning,Thoughts on the Days of French 'n' Swedish YouTube Video on Anki,"Days of French 'n' Swedish is one of my favourite language learning Youtubers - mainly because he is realistic and offers sensible tips to average learners.

In his latest video, he notes the problem language learners have with Anki and other Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) is that the size of Anki decks quickly increase to the point they are unmanageable and destroys the learner's motivation.

I agree with this, but it seems there is an underlying assumption that at the end of studying an Anki deck the learner will understand all the contents perfectly. This has always been my main problem with SRS systems:

1. If I use a pre-created Anki deck, I sometimes find I will misunderstand the context of a word. An example is the word ""customs"" - as this may refer to either ""customs and traditions"" or ""customs duties"" (taxes paid on entry of items into a country). Of course, this led to an amusing / confusing situation when talking about this.
2. If I see a word I don't know and add it to my own Anki deck, I have no understanding of whether this word is frequently used. As an example I would point out the words ""dog"" and ""pooch"" in English - if English were my target language and I encountered the word ""pooch"" before ""dog"" I might say something like ""Do you have a pooch?"" - this sounds a bit strange.
3. It's easy to misunderstand the cultural context of a word. So if a word is rude or a swear word, I might not fully understand not to say it in a work environment or with children.

The languages are not perfectly similar but my thought was if I learn Hindi first, I can use what few resources for Gujarati I can find to pick up the language.  Would there be an advantage to learning Hindi first, or should I spend that time on just learning Gujarati in any way that I can?

languagelearning,Trilled r,"Every time I try doing an alveolar trill I just end up somehow doing a one-lip trill on either lip? (or a dental fricative) I don't even understand how that works, I don't even touch the lips or anything it just happens. I try relaxing the tip of my tongue and I try cupping the tongue, either my body's just averse to relaxing the tip of the tongue when I need it to or it's just not working. I try doing an alveolar tap and blowing a lot of air at the same time. I try repositioning my tongue to any position that could be useful. I try making a little space in between my tongue and the articulation point. I've been trying for so long now and I just can't seem to get it. I was born in Sweden speaking Swedish and even by the age of 10 I never got it, I just got by using [ɾ] or [ɽ] or /ʀ/ (I lived in southern Sweden and heard the guttural sounds used sometimes, although it was more trills). I went to my school's speech therapy for it when I was in around 1st grade but it went no where. 

For a long time now I've lived in the U.S. and I'm trying to learn Spanish which is even more important to trill in unless you live in certain countries, and even more I'm heavily interested in linguistics now so I want to have [r] and [r̝] in the list of sounds I can make, for one because they sound fucking amazing and for two because coronal trills are the most common rhotic. I've been trying so hard for a long time and I can't get them. It's so annoying and frustrating and doing things like this for so long and getting jack from it is tiring and infuriating to me. I've read every method and tip there is and I've practiced so much.

I see people saying they've finally done it after years, I can't practice that one thing for hours for years and stay sane, I'm much too impatient to wait 2 years to get it or whatever. That won't make me be able to do it any faster, I just think that's insane and too much to ask of one grown person. I feel embarrassed with how much I've failed at this, especially since so many people that never make it or hear it in their life can just start making it on a whim (like to simulate machine gun sounds or engines or something), and I'm stuck here knowing anything linguistic about it and practicing so much yet I'm not even close.

I can't afford to go on for hours every day either because of all the time that's wasting on just trying to make a sound, I'm shit at multitasking so I have to focus on it and stop whatever else I'm doing. I'll do it for a while and get tired then do it in the shower. What doesn't help is I don't just want to be making stupid noises when my parents are home, so I have to do it when they're not, which severely fucks me over whenever I'm in the mood to try it. I don't have any disorder or deformation or anything. I just can't... Maybe it's just my attitude??? That I'm not willing to put years of my life towards it? If it's that then I'm beyond help.",1625981634,DeviantLuna,2,580,2929,9,2

languagelearning,Slowly (app) is amazing for finding language penpals,"So the entire concept of Slowly is that it tries to mimic sending letters, you can send a letter to anyone in the world and based on their location relative to you it takes different times to arrive. 

I’ve been using it to practice Spanish and it’s been amazing, I’ve been taking a dive into Uruguayan culture and being able to specifically search and send letters to Uruguayans to learn more and share my excitement has been fantastic. It’s so exciting seeing “new letter arriving in 23 hours”. It’s been really funny because some people are like “I’ll be honest, after seeing a letter come from the United States I didn’t expect it to be in Spanish”. 

You’re able to set your level of the language so others know and so if you’re more of a learner you can also actively seek out people who are bilingual in English and they can help you out more. I don’t journal or anything in Spanish so this has been great practice, just being able to punch out multiple 500 word letters a night to people across the world. 

There’s definitely some weird people on the app but it mitigates most of the weirdness of anonymous platforms in that it’s mostly text based, both parties have to agree before anyone sends pictures and I haven’t really had anyone try so it’s been a wholly positive experience for me, I recommend people try it out.",1625977278,Inspir0,32,241,1330,52,8

languagelearning,Advice regarding a study plan for DELF B2,"Hey everyone! So I have been learning french by myself for a while, on and off, and decided to get serious about 1.5 months ago and make a concrete plan since i’ll be applying for my masters in France around early 2023. So I need to be B2 by the end of next year, to be able to take the DELF test.. roughly 1 year 4.5 months to go. I’m unsure what my current level is, i think i have finished A1 for reading/listening but production is difficult, can write simple stuff though. I can mostly follow the first few episodes of Inner French podcast with about 60% comprehension, for example, but can’t speak much.

I have been doing:
1. Aim to finish Harry Potter’s 2nd book this month. I went through the first chapter so far, and marked the vocabulary or grammar structures i didn’t understand. Will review unknown vocab at the end of every chapter, so far i only understand 50% of it but it’s super fun so far. Did a lot of shadowing with a few graded readers before this.
2. 1 italki lesson per week, in-between i work on the assignments my teacher gives me. Next week i’m supposed to speak about an article i read. 
3. I spend about 30ish minutes everyday transcribing short easy videos for active listening practice.
4. Write small journals in French, last month i did this everyday but this month i’ve only done it once.
5. Not following any grammar course, so far i learned whatever grammar via context. Should i focus on this? Last year I burned out doing grammar so haven’t touched it once. 

Not sure what else should i be doing. Is it possible to read extensively to increase vocabulary instead of anki flashcards, if i’m on a tight timeline? I love reading, but anki increasingly became a time-sink last year and i eventually just left French alone for months. I am wondering if I should try it again, but not sure if it’s worth it.

I’ve been learning now for just over a year now - using initially just text books (‘practice makes perfect’ books have been the best for me) and am now at a point where I’m transitioning more to reading magazines (which I was impressed at my ability to do so easily) and watching french TV with french subtitles etc, as well as keeping a journal. My girlfriend is french and we speak daily in french too

My weird feeling, which is what I’m asking about here, is that whilst I’m transitioning away from text books, I really benefit from the structure they can give so want to keep them as part of my daily french learning at least a little bit so I don’t forget important grammar etc, and yet it is becoming harder and harder to find textbooks that are in my sort of capability - they all seem to either be for absolute beginners, ‘intermediate’ (which tend to end up being too easy) or advanced which I feel like stretches me a bit too hard.

languagelearning,Should listening be comprehensible?,"I’ve asked a similar question before, but I still don’t know how to feel about this topic. I worry about my listening bc you hear about these people who spend hours listening to their TL, even as a beginner &amp; they recommend it (so incomprehensible input is good bc you are still listening to your TL). On the other hand, I see people who say listening should be comprehensible and if it isn’t, it’s a waste of time.

Now, I worry about my listening cuz I feel like I should listen more. I have taken people’s advice in the past (doing incomprehensible input) and I am ok with it bc I can use subs. Sure, I may not get it whatsoever, but I have subs so I can understand. However, with comprehensible input I cannot stand it bc I’m still a beginner (middling/slightly high A2 rn) which means I have to listen to Peppa Pig &amp; other boring stuff. I tried doing the DW radio thing aimed for A1 &amp; A2 which I did for about 2-3 weeks maybe on and off. I really tried to listen to it daily but it always felt like a chore, and when I’d finished one episode I was so relieved. I literally had to force myself to listen to it (15 mins for one episode) and it was really painful tbh. Same with things like Peppa Pig.

Now I don’t know what to do. I stopped using incomprehensible input bc people said it’s a waste of time, and I tried comprehensible input but I genuinely don’t have the willpower to do it. I do have audio that comes with my textbook, but is that enough right now? The audio that comes with my textbook is comprehensible for the most part (although with some audios I have to replay it many, many times) and I do enjoy it. Is this enough or do I need more?

languagelearning,Does learning a foreign language at an older age impair your native/better-known language abilities?,"I’m aware of the struggles of people who are born into a bilingual/trilingual/(n)lingual family to sometimes differentiate among languages. However, I’m more curious about the arguably less fortunate folk, who’ve discovered that they liked languages later in life (teenagers-adults) and to what degree they are affected.

Personally, the more languages I know, the harder it is to keep my level, even at my native language or one I’m better at already. Does anyone else experience that, especially if you’re living in your home country and your exposure to a specific foreign language(s) could be considered rather low? 

I’ll illustrate the problem with my personal examples, in case it’s yet unclear to you what I’m talking about. Feel free to skip. It might appear like more of a rant and personal context (TL;DR at the end or refer to the title)

(I have read the rules of this subreddit and it might appear like borderline tasteless humor/too personal. That’s not my intention, I hope I can convey it well enough and present it merely as examples.) 

Lithuanian - native, English - C1 (idk, idc, certified, but really, i’m just trying to get by) Chinese - A2-B1 French- A1 production, B1-B2 comprehension, Italian A1, Russian - immeasurable, srsly, but it’s bad (A(-1) to B1)

EN to LT - Instead of using natural, appropriate words and expressions, I tend to translate from English and come up with terribly awkward expressions; Mix and match in a sentence - switch languages every second word (grammar who?)

CN to EN/LT - using the Chinese sentence structure i.e. Eat not eat? We going to the park mm? (No intonation) 

CN - it’s the most unique one in my list, so it’s easier. It doesn’t change that in times of despair, when trying to speak, I still mix in either French or German (not worth a mention, but German’s there in my subconsciousness) in my mind but never vocalize it.

&lt;slight hyperbolization&gt;

FR - boy oh boy, I just don’t function in it, if all else fails, English with a French accent. 

IT - in my mind, it’s French sans the oral cursive (don’t ask what I mean, just don’t), learn the conjugations, use them, speak French. On a good day, it works 2,3% of the time. 

RU - I speak it with a French accent. If I spoke it with a Lithuanian (native) accent, it would be like 5x more comprehensible due to SOME similarities between the languages and their pronunciation.

&lt;/slight hyperbolization&gt;

Okay, I’m done. If asked what languages I speak, I say “none” or sometimes, I say “all of them” and refer to myself as a queen of A1 levels.

I am a layman in this field so I was wondering if someone with greater experience can share some insight on how to improve my memory for a vocabulary that is completely foreign to me. Are there any good books or videos that tackles this problem?",1625919218,GreatHuckleberry7811,3,138,784,94,15

languagelearning,Has anyone else cut out the “formal” way of learning a language?,"So I’ve been self studying Japanese for a while (immersion, studying kanji, etc.) and as of late I’ve noticed that in all the videos that give you ways to “fluency” so to speak, it’s always the same thing. AJATT or getting the Genki books, Japanese from Zero, Anki etc. Now I don’t know if its because as I student these methods remind me too much of a class or what, but ever since I realized this, I completely cut out “formal” learning methods. Now I know it’s different for everyone, but for me I felt like it was slowing me down. This week has been sort of a trial run for me without a set path to go on. The only thing I used to study was my tv shows, books and Jisho. I would watch my shows (YouTube videos as well) and start bookmarking them in my Jisho. So far I’ve only read children’s books and can sort of fill in the gaps with new words and sentence structures. Again, I’ll bookmark my new words and I’ve noticed that after seeing something new about 3 times, it’s pretty hard for me to forget. Sometimes I’ll watch the news, and even though I can’t understand almost anything, little phrases here and there stand out and I bookmark them.

Another thing that I feel like many might disapprove of is English subtitles. Only after I’ve watched a show or listened to a song a few times I turn on the subtitles and read the English while listening to the sound. I know some people say to only use target language subtitles but I feel like using native language subtitles is a more efficient way to expand my vocabulary. 

The results of my trial period have even shocked me. I can recognize more sounds, kanji and words than I did before. I was even able to read my first sentence that had a mixture of kanji and hiragana. Ive even began reading books for ages 6. I know it doesn’t sound like much but I definitely see an improvement in myself!",1625913553,Luv_Luyxoxo,18,349,1853,64,12

languagelearning,Intermediate/Upper intermediate Italian resources - what is out there?,"I am strongly considering learning Italian, mainly because I love the sound of the language as well as the food culture in Italy. I also am a big fan of a few Italian authors, like Elena Ferrante. 

However I am worried about what content exists at around the intermediate/upper intermediate level of Italian. Mainly, is there enough content? I am fluent in French, and I mainly advanced in French with the help of [podcasts](https://www.rfi.fr/fr/podcasts/) and [online books that came with audio](http://www.litteratureaudio.com/) (see links). Listening to tons of podcasts and audiobooks with transcripts was without a doubt the number one thing that got me to fluency. I know that I learn the best with resources like these after the beginner phase. I really dislike more ""formal"" methods of learning outside of the beginner phase (i.e., an intermediate level Italian grammar book...just please no...)

I also see this with friends who are learning Japanese or Korean - there are TONS of fun, real-life, more ""informal"" intermediate/upper intermediate level resources to learn these languages. There's pop songs, dramas, podcasts, anime, manga, webtoons with audio, etc. It really helps in staying motivated and learning the language more quickly and naturally. I'd like to find similar things for Italian if possible.

So my question for anyone learning/who has learned Italian: do you have any podcasts, Youtube channels, or audiobook websites (preferably with transcripts) that you know of? 

Also, a bonus question if anyone has any experience: how helpful is knowing French when learning Italian? I hear they are very related!

languagelearning,Are some people just more inclined to language based on interest/perception?,"This applies to any language, but I am posting with regards to Japanese !!

I’m just interested in this consesus/facts on this. My best friend and I both love Japanese culture, history, plan on going to Japan and have been talking about it since we were 14!! We both listen to a lot of Japanese music, watch anime(I know that sounds stereotypical😭😭), and like to read abt Japanese mythology/history.

We have both tried, relatively casually, to learn basic Japanese for when we do eventually go !! 

I am deeply fascinated by linguistics, am in a major related to speech and language, and am very much an artist/visual learner with a good memory. I listen very closely to a lot of words, pay attention to and look into random kanji, and translate short texts out of curiosity a lot, and find myself already knowing more words and recognizing more kanji than I expected to as I (again, very casually) set out to learn.

My friend is less interested in linguistics/language as a whole, she doesn’t really listen for/pay attention to words that come up frequently in songs, shows, etc. She is finding it more difficult to recognize and remember kanji. Just as an example, when looking for a specific song on spotify on a Japanese album where all the songs are in kanji/kana, even if I don’t fully know the meaning, I can usually pick out the song we are looking for because I’ll recognize a few, whereas for her its usually more of a guessing game until we get the right song.

Do you think some people, whether it be something in the brain, or whether its just based on your respective interest/passion for language and linguistics, are simply perceptive or have an easier time learning a new language, even for something.. so..SO difficult as japanese !!!

I see people often get obsessed with trying to lose their accent cause they don't want to be treated like a foreigner but like a local.

It doesn't matter if you have no accent if you can only speak slowly and lack vocabulary. If you want to be treated like a local you must be able to speak fluently so that native speaker can talk to you the same way they would talk to a native speaker.

Imo having an accent or not has close to no influence on whether you are seen as a foreigner or not. It's all about you language skills.",1625831714,zuluportero,232,168,884,43,7

For those who dedicate hours per day to listening practice, are you able to concentrate all the time? If not, how could you know the time spent worth it?

Personally, I also watched loads of movies with translated subtitles in my leisure time, but I would not count them as listening practice because I know that I did not really focus on deciphering the audio but reading the subtitles in my mother tongue instead.

I grew up in Southern Florida, where most people spoke Spanish, and having grown up around German family (my oma), German was also used. Alas, I've only picked up on them passively. I speak English natively. 

In my quest to learn languages, I've noticed a few issues: my English grammar suffers in that I will sometimes use German word order to express ideas. Or sometimes I find myself translating to Norwegian to speak German.

languagelearning,Do I have a chance to become a native in my first language? - deaf since birth,"I have kept reading some of the articles, discussions, etc that mention about it's never too late to learn a second language. Well, how about the first language? I didn't have a proper education while growing up. I wouldn't be surprised because people didn't know how to teach a deaf kid. Now I'm over 30 years old and currently taking seriously on my English. Do I have a chance? I may have some difficulties remembering/understanding some small words like articles (a,an,the) or get mixed up when to use ""in"" and ""on"" in some sentences. However, with little practice and more readings, I would able to write fluently.   


I have been using Anki a lot. I'm studying 13,000 idioms (learned 6,500 idioms within 6 months). It's pretty amazing how many idioms I have learned can be found (in or is that ""on""?) Instagram, Reddit, books, etc. Currently, learning another half left of idioms. Hopefully, I'll learn all 13,000 idioms by end of this year. Then I would study the grammar again.   


One thing that scares me is that how the brain would be underdeveloped as a kid if he or she isn't exposed to a language. I didn't want this to hurt my chance to have a successful life with achieved goals. 

For those who are wondering, I know sign language. I learned to sign at 16 years old. It took me less than 1 year to be able to communicate well in sign language. Then in two years or so, I'm fluent in sign language with facial expressions. 

I don't consider sign language as a language because it is not something I can ""write"" with people in general. A sign language wouldn't help me to understand a written language as a second language.

languagelearning,What languages would you like added to Google Translate?,"Google Translate is becoming bigger and bigger with, I think anyway, over a hundred different languages. I believe that we should add more and more, it is a useful tool for helping learn languages and also quick and easy good translations. For me, I would look to see:

&amp;#x200B;

Ainu: the native people of the Hokkaido prefecture of Japan, the most northernmost region. With less than 1,000 speakers is important that the language is preserved and maintained. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tlingit: a native northwest pacific Canadian and Alaskan people who are much alike to the Ainu, believed to have shared a common Siberian ancestor with them. Their language is very unique and their culture is unlike anything I've seen before.

&amp;#x200B;

Haida: basically the brothers to the Tlingit but related to different groups who crossed over from Siberia to Alaska. 

&amp;#x200B;

Kalmyk: a Mongolic language from the republic of Kalmykia in the south Caucasus of Russia. They migrated from Mongolia all the way to Russia, very great people. It was also used as inspiration for some of the languages of the creatures of Star Wars.

&amp;#x200B;

Manchu: the native language of the Manchu people, once powerful but now a minority. Very great people with a proud and long history.

&amp;#x200B;

Nivkh: similar to Ainu, on the island of Sakhalin. They were part of the Mongolian empire and became incorporated into what is now the Russian Federation. They are very unique and great people.

&amp;#x200B;

Guajajara: a native Amazonian people, a group which I feel are very underrepresented in the language world. There are many Amazonian languages that get overlooked sadly and they deserve the attention.

&amp;#x200B;

Tibetan: this one frustrates me since it is quite a prominent language. Tibet is and will forever be its own seperate nation and its language deserves representation.

&amp;#x200B;

Yolngu and Miriwoong: Australian Aboriginal languages from the north of Australia. There are currently no Aborigine languages on Google Translate which is a shame. I picked Yolngu because it's where Yothu Yindi is from and Miriwoong is just a very pleasant sounding language.

&amp;#x200B;

Greenlandic: since Inuktitut was added, I was thinking that they should also add Greenlandic too. It's a great place and around 50k speak it so why not?

&amp;#x200B;

Sioux, Cheyenne, Mohawk, Lenape, Cree, Mi'kmaq, Chippewa, Mohawk, Huron, Delaware etc: the Native Americans are highly underrepresented. I'd argue that they suffered the worse out of all of the native groups. There are still 2 million of them in the US and they deserve much more appreciation.

languagelearning,One year of language learning (Spanish) down! How many more to go? My progress and thoughts.,"**TL;DR:** I've spent about 1600 hours over the past year studying Spanish and have reached a self-assessed B1/B2 level. Below is an outline of what I did (Baselang, conversation practice, 350+ hours of Netflix, 6000+ pages of reading novels, Kwiziq, other misc stuff), where I'm at, what I didn't expect, and what I'd do differently.

**Going in:** Native English speaker with no prior Spanish knowledge unless you count words like hola and gracias. I don’t have particularly motivating reasons to learn Spanish other than I had lots of free time during the pandemic and wanted a challenge. I told myself I would stick to it for at least a year.

**After one year:**

* **Listening:** B2? I can understand news and dubbed television with &gt;95% comprehension. For example, minus a handful of words, I understand word for word [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq_KA3VVN-4) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPpxxf2MWc8). I have a harder time with native television series, movies and podcasts with multiple speakers talking over each other.

* **Reading:** High B2? Definitely my strongest skill. I read on Kindle and mark every word I don't know (even if the meaning is obvious from context), and averaged under 2 unknown words per page for the last three books I read (*Reina roja*, *La buena suerte*, and *Como polvo en el viento*), all of which are novels originally written in Spanish within the past 10 years. I definitely have the most trouble with slang, colloquialisms, idioms, cultural references, and ""localisms"" or words that have a different meaning in certain countries. My reading speed is slow but no longer painful at ~25 pages per hour.

* **Speaking:** B1? I feel pretty comfortable having a conversation about almost anything, though I certainly make mistakes and feel limited in what I can express. The last time I spoke to a new tutor, we talked about science fiction, and I explained the premise of the series The Travelers (which I watched with Spanish dubs). It involves time travel and is confusing in any language! I also talked about how science fiction has affected my view of society and the world. On a really good day, I'll make fewer than 10 grammatical errors in a one hour conversation, with more near the end when I'm getting tired. On a bad day, the sky is the limit.

* **Writing:** This is the skill I practice the least, so I'm not sure how to rate this. My spelling is generally good as I pay close attention to accentuation and check spelling with cloze deletion cards in Anki, but I probably don't write (or speak) very naturally. This is the skill I care about least.


**Phase 1: Baselang + supplemental material (~5 months)**

* Completed Baselang Real World program (Levels 0 through 10, including 130 electives) in ~4 months
* Podcasts: How to Spanish, El Washington Post, Radio Ambulante, Historias perdidas, TED en español, Asi como suena, Escuela de nada
* Youtube: Visual Politik, Luisito Comunica, Noticias Telemundo, BBC News Mundo, Platxi, DW Español, Vice en español, Alanxelmundo, Superholly, Tom Segura en español
* Newspapers / Magazines: El País, MIT Technology Review, National Geographic, NYT, Wapo
* Anki for vocabulary, ~50 new words per day

**Phase 2: Lots of input, some output (~7 months)**

* 350+ hours of Netflix
* 6000+ pages of reading novels
* Continued with 4-6 hours of conversation practice per week
* Continued with Anki daily, fewer new words per day than in Phase 1
* Continued with reading news, watching Youtube, and listening to podcasts

Going into phase 2, I was especially frustrated by my listening comprehension. Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/kmpzt3/250_hours_of_nonsubtitled_netflix/), [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/j1gbrg/spanish_listening_from_b1_to_a_solid_c1_in_500/) and a 10k page reading challenge, I started watching tons of Netflix and reading novels.

Listening has translated the best to improving my speaking skills. I often find myself saying things because they ""sound right."" Reading has been great for learning vocabulary and some grammar.

**Grammar and other stuff (spread out during both phases)**

* Conjugation practice, daily for the past 300 days. I maintain 100% in all of the tenses on the Ella app, which only takes a couple minutes per day at this point.
* Kwiziq for grammar. 90+% in A0 to B2 levels.
* Worked on grammar books but haven't finished them: Practice Makes Perfect Complete Spanish Grammar and MacGraw Hill Intermediate Spanish.
* Some writing here and there, but not very much.
* FSI Basic Spanish, useful but not very fun. I didn't finish it but plan to continue it in the future.
* [This game](https://babadum.com) is fun.
* [This number comprehension tool](https://langpractice.com/) is great.
* I also tried various apps that ultimately weren't useful.

**Total Time Spent: 1600 hours**

I did not track time, but I have stats from Netflix and Anki, and I'm estimating 20 pages per hour for reading, 2 minutes per Kwiziq test + 15 hours for grammar, and 3 hours per week for everything else.

* Baselang / conversation - 450 hours
* Netflix - 350 hours (not including any rewatching)
* Reading books - 300 hours
* Vocabulary / Anki - 300 hours (not counting time to create cards which was a MAJOR time suck)
* Grammar - 50 hours (not including Baselang)
* Everything else (reading news, non-Netflix listening, etc.) - 150 hours

**Some things along the way that I didn’t expect**

* I've read that it takes 1000 hours to get to C1 in Spanish, and frankly I don't feel particularly close. Maybe I'm underestimating myself, maybe I'm a very slow learner, maybe stuff like Netflix and listening practice don't count towards those 1000 hours, I don't know. Whatever it is, I feel like I'm still a good 1000 hours away from C1. I plan to listen to another 3-500 hours of Netflix to get my listening there, and reading another 10k pages at least. Plus I've barely scratched the surface on writing.

* The sheer quantity of listening I needed to do surprised me. All the advice about listening to hundreds of hours is spot on.

* Learning grammar is so useful! I know lots of people hate it and would rather spend hundreds of hours on anything else rather than 5 minutes of grammar, but if you can tolerate studying grammar absolutely do it. Grammar is &lt;5% of my total study time, but a little goes a long way.

* 1-on-1 tutoring is a pretty inefficient way to learn a language. Don’t get me wrong, I love it, but the real value came in how much more fun it was to interact with another person. I didn’t care if it took me 5x as long to go through the material.

* I'm a heritage speaker in another language, and I'm surprised by how different the languages feel. I am *very limited* in my HL, but anything I'm able to do is effortless. Either I understand something or I don't, there's no in between and trying harder to listen or make sense of something doesn't help. Maybe this is because my HL is distant from English, so there aren't really cognates. In my HL, I can effortlessly hear when others switch tenses, switch between tenses while speaking, and recognize spoken foreign words as being foreign. These take more effort in Spanish. On the plus side, reading and writing in Spanish are way easier. I'm illiterate in my HL.

**What I could have done differently**

If I *had* to learn Spanish on a tighter schedule and was willing to have less fun doing it, this is what I would change. Caveat: I don't know if I could keep up motivation without the fun.

* I would cut Baselang and most 1-on-1 tutoring / conversation practice. If there’s anything you can pinpoint that you want to improve other than pronunciation or ease in speaking to another human being, you can almost certainly do it cheaper and better on your own: grammar, conjugation, vocabulary, listening, even speaking, etc. For me, 1-on-1 tutoring is best for increasing my comfort level and staying engaged. BUT most of my actual speaking skills improvement were from outside sources. For example, I made tons of errors matching gender while speaking to tutors who would repeatedly correct me. It wasn’t until I started doing FSI drills outside of lessons that I finally internalized how to actually *do* that. It was like I finally figured out which muscle I needed to flex.

* Approach grammar in a more structured way. Instead of doing grammar first with Baselang, then with Kwiziq and Practice Makes Perfect, then with McGraw Hill, I would cut out Baselang and Kwiziq and replace them with a textbook or [StudySpanish.com](http://www.studySpanish.com) for an intro, then go straight to McGraw Hill with [Lingolia](https://espanol.lingolia.com/en/) as a good free grammar resource. Baselang’s grammar just isn’t very good, and Kwiziq is better for reviewing what you already know instead of learning it for the first time.

* Ramp up difficulty level in listening and reading at a faster pace.

**Going forward:** I wasn’t sure what I was getting myself into when I started, but now I am hooked! I love the process of learning Spanish and plan to keep going to at least the C1 level. I like the mental challenge, learning about various Spanish speaking cultures through reading, noticing the similarities and differences between Spanish and English, and I even kinda like Anki in a masochistic sort of way.

Sometimes I feel I ""should"" be making faster progress given the amount of time I've spent. I've tried upping the pace by cutting down on the less productive activities, but then learning starts to feel like a chore. I think if I want to stay in the game, I have to accept that enjoying the process is more important to long term success than being as efficient as possible in my learning.",1625772815,barbellicious,49,1636,9800,92,16

Some time ago, I realized that my listening comprehension was weak and I had yet to consume any content in Spanish so for the past  two months, I have mainly only focused on consuming media, primarily through YouTube and podcasts, for usually 1.5-2 hours per day, while also taking conversational lessons twice a week with my online tutors. I definitely feel major improvement when listening and trying to understand content, and my conversations with tutors definitely run more smoothly as of late.

Now although I love the improvement I am seeing, I don't think purely consuming content in the TL is going to get me where I want to be in the next 6-12 months, and since I have two months until school begins again, I think this would be the best time to get moving. However, I am a bit stuck since I don't think I have ever truly ""studied"" Spanish in the traditional sense and I feel it would be greatly beneficial for me to try it out, even if I am a person that has never enjoyed traditional studying and find it more boring.

With that being said, what would be the best resources for this type of more structured, straightfoward study? Textbooks, SRS programs, etc.?

Also, for those who have been a similar situation, how did you get back into true studying and less ""fun"" activity.",1625768666,ValeValeVale0,0,287,1620,46,9

languagelearning,I don’t want to speak. Anyone else?,"**Tl;dr:** Not interested in making friends with natives and not particularly bothered about “using” the language to communicate. Anyone else?

So I’ve been learning Japanese for 2 years and have just started outputting. 

For a bit of background (**skip this paragraph** if you don’t care) I’m very introverted and derive much more pleasure from doing things in isolation, such as pursuing hobbies and studying, as opposed to communicating with other human beings. I don’t drink, party, go out on weekends, plan on getting married etc. Not because I’m socially anxious or have no friends, but because I would simply rather be doing other things.

And similar to many other people learning Japanese, I started because I wanted to watch those Chinese cartoons without subtitles like a true weeb. And I thought that it would be cool if I could **think** in Japanese. Note how this is different from wanting to **speak** Japanese. 

But at the time, and for a large part of my language learning “journey”, I don’t think I fully appreciated this difference. Whether it was because the pandemic hadn’t started yet and I was unaware as to how much I enjoy spending time alone, or whether I was just lying to myself, I convinced myself that I wanted to **speak** Japanese.

And now that I’ve finally reached stage 3 and am trying to start texting and speaking with natives, it’s become painfully obvious that I have no desire to make Japanese friends and communicate with them. I don’t even plan on living in Japan; I just want to consume their content.

I’ll still do things like improving my pronunciation because I find things like that fun in and of itself.

languagelearning,"What's your opinion on this, maybe somewhat weird (?), vocabulary/anki approach?","I want to preface my post by saying that before using this method I didn't add new words to my anki deck regularly enough and often ran out of new cards to learn, so while for me this approach makes sense I'm rather asking you to see if you think my approach in general makes sense or maybe doesn't.
And also, I currently know about ~2000+ words passively (there is a quite accurate test for this online) so I'm not a complete beginner.

My approach is choosing some media I enjoy (currently an anime with TL dub and sub) and adding almost every word I don't know to my deck. The reason I'm doing it is that I thought to myself ""this word isn't common/important"" wayyyy too often and this held me back from learning more new words quicker and because my number one goal isn't language production but understanding the language well. Only after I do so I want to practice outputting more regularly (I'm using a method similar to MIA)

My idea behind this approach is that no matter how much specific, somewhat unnecessary, words I encounter, the most important ones should be there as well. And because I will need these words at some time anyway it doesn't harm me in any way.

This presents me from over analyzing and falsely assuming a word to be unimportant. But most importantly, it helps me get closer to my goal of learning 30 words a day.

I will continue to test this method for some time and then see how the results will be. So, what do you think about my approach to learning new words?",1625759951,El_pizza,0,277,1497,80,11

Even in a language I consider myself fluent in, in a culture that I obsessively studied for over a decade, if you put me in a room with a group of native speakers who are all ""shooting the breeze"" and generally in a good mood, I can't meaningfully join in, follow and participate.

languagelearning,"Torn between Norwegian, German, and Mandarin?","(I’m writing this on mobile, apologies for any errors!)

I’ve recently decided, after years of back and forth, that I want to finally learn a new language.  However, I’m absolutely torn on which one to learn:

Norwegian - I’ve always loved the history and culture of Norway.  Honestly, if I ever lived in a place outside of the English-speaking countries, it’d be Norway lol.  Also, I’ve read Norwegian is one of the easiest languages for native English speakers to learn, which had always caught my attention.

German - I have strong ancestral roots in Germany and have always wanted to connect with them, both by learning the language and culture.  I’m also an accounting/business student in uni at the moment, and have always heard German is the business language of Europe, something that leads me to learning the language.

Mandarin - this is sort of the outlier in the trio but for good reason.  The Chinese culture/history has always intrigued me and the nation is absolutely gorgeous, it’s a dream to visit one day.  Where China is growing so fast economically too, I’ve always felt Mandarin would be good to learn given my place in the business field.  The only thing that holds me back from choosing it is how difficult I hear it is (tones, characters, etc.)

Important to note, my goal is to learn all three throughout my life, I just need to pick one to start with.  I also understand this is a personal decision, but if anyone has any advice I’d greatly appreciate it!

Also important to note, I have a small speech impediment (ankyloglossia) where my tongue is abnormally short and anchored to the bottom of my mouth.  This means I can’t trill R’s or any sounds similar to that - trust me, I’ve spent years trying.  I don’t think any of these three languages have trills, but it’s just something I get nervous about when thinking about learning pronunciations haha.

I met a Chinese girl online through an online game last year, we hang out together, and at the time, I deem that as a friendship. We then lost contact with each other and never spoke again. The only way we can communicate is through Steam, but I never use it to chat with her.

Fast forward over a year later, I receive a notification on my stream profile, and it was her dropping some greetings, asking how I've been and whether I miss her. I was so moved at that time because I never expected to receive such a message, especially from her.  


I always knew that everything is banned in China. Discord, Facebook, Twitter &amp; Instagram. They need to use VPN to use those platforms. Despite that, she proceeds to make accounts so she could contact me. I fell even harder. Imagine having to open a VPN every time you want to chat with someone you could regard as a total stranger.

I found an idea and downloaded WeChat. I felt grateful. It was the right choice. She doesn't have to use VPN anymore, and WeChat's feature really big improvement to our conversation. She doesn't have to use Google Translate anymore; she can directly highlight my chat and translate it to Chinese. Yes, she needs Google Translate every time we chat with each other. Her English is too limited; she needs to use Google Translate to translate from Chinese to English. I fell even harder. She never gives up talking to me.

Every time I call her, I use the chatbox 90% of the time instead of actually talking to her. She could barely understand me, and she can't express her feelings very well; I can feel it. It was so depressing because using the chat box instead of actually speaking to each other sounds so sad. If only she speaks English if only I speak Chinese. She even said she will not take WeChat's feature for granted because even though I can translate her chat to English, she will still try her best to use English. After all, she wants to learn English so she could talk to me better.  


I decided too; I will learn Chinese, whether this is a stupid reason or romantic reason, I don't know. I want to make it work for us. Money, religion, education, culture is one thing, but not understanding each other in the first place is just too painful for me.

I know, I'm aware of that. I just want to vent it to people, Will she still love me by then? it's not gonna take few months to speak Chinese, let alone read it.

(It's not actually very important. I just want to write my story down. You can skip it if you want.)

My first language is Mandarin. However, Mandarin isn't my parents' first language, but second. Their first language is Wenzhounese, a dialect spoken in Wenzhou where they grew up. They've moved to another city where they have to speak Mandarin long before my birth. In case you don't know, Wenzhounese and Mandarin are two very different languages and not mutually intelligeble. It's like how different English and German are.

From what I can remember, people who took care of me including my parents, my aunt and uncle when I was a baby (or in the critical period), whose first language is not Mandarin, always talked to me in Mandarin even though they talk to each other in Wenzhounese in front of me. 

According to my parents, I could speak Wenzhounese before I went to preschool. But after I went to preschool where I only heard and spoke Mandarin, I stopped speaking Wenzhounese. Now thinking about it, Wenzhounese is never my first language in which case I couldn't lose the language ability that easily. It's a heritage language of mine. And although my parents say I could speak Wenzhounese, it can't mean I can speak it fluently, but only to a very limited degree.

And the pattern remains as I grow up -- They talk to each other in Wenzhounese and switch to Mandarin when talking to me. Yet I still grow some abillity of the language, mostly in listening. I could understand most of what they say in daily life, but still could only say few words myself.

About half a year ago, I began interested in learning the language actively as opposed to passively previously. So I asked them to talk to me solely in Wenzhounese. They were very happy about it.

# My problem

Since then, my language ability has improved a lot. But, it doesn't mean my Wenzhounese is good now. It's still terrible overall, just much better than before. **The main problem is that my vocabulary is very limited. And the worst part is that I don't have enough materials to learn from like I have when learning other languages. I don't live in Wenzhou, so I can't talk to a lot of natives, only my two parents. (I may move to Wenzhou in the future, but in the next 5 years I don't see how I can.) You can hardly find any films or tv series in Wenzhounese because it's not a major language (or dialect) like Cantonese. You can't find any systematic reading materials or courses to help you learn. All I can rely on (at least for now) to learn the language is my parents. I do have learned about some words about kitchen, food, or dining because that's where our conversations happen mostly. My concern is how to expand my vocabulary in more general things and other topics we don't really talk. (And after writing my problem down, I kinda figured part of it out myself, which makes me feel dumb to ask them in the first place.) Apparently I have to hear them say those words before I get to learn them.**

**Unluckily, I don't know what to talk to them because you know, we are parents and child. Therefore I feel like my vocabulary will never be complete. So I come to this subreddit to see if I can get any advice.**",1625683328,ERfReSCA,14,595,3279,101,16

languagelearning,Please stop highlighting skin color in language-related content,"This mostly goes out to Youtubers, but this could apply to any language content creator that could be lurking. The whole “WHITE GUY SPEAKS FLUENT JAPANESE” type of content is absolutely absurd for the following reasons:

1. Skin color has nothing to do with language ability. 

2. It perpetuates stereotypes and makes little of minorities within linguistic communities, as though speaking one’s native language is somehow a feat if their ethnic features don’t align with those of the average speaker. 

3. Especially when a non-white person is doing it, it seems you’re trying to imply that people of color can’t study languages, especially those outside of their ethnic heritage.

These reasons, plus some more that I’m sure exist, make this type of content obnoxious clickbait that actually has harmful societal implications. If you’ve done this, please think twice next time.",1625664645,SyrenPrince,276,140,878,63,8
languagelearning,"Study abroad with the goal to learn the language, should I go to the big city or the small one?"," Hey guys, I am planning on studying in Spain at a university in the fall of 2022 for either a semester or 2 semesters (I'm leaning towards 2). I've got 2 options Madrid or Zaragoza, for a little while I really wanted to go to Madrid however, now I have realized that Madrid may not be the best option to go to if I really want to improve with my Spanish.  
A little bit about me; I have been learning Spanish for the last 2 years almost and I think I'm around the B1 level (CEFR). I really love the language and would like to study in Spain to meet mostly local people so I can improve much more.  
Honestly I prefer going to Madrid because it is a bigger city there are more things to do I think and it's also central so it would be easier to go to other places in Spain.  
The issue is that I am scared that if I would go to Madrid I may get stuck in an Erasmus student bubble or that because Madrid is such an international city people will talk to me in English, both resulting in me not practicing Spanish as much I would like to.  
On the other hand there is Zaragoza a much smaller city with less inhabitants and I guess less Erasmus and other international students. So, I would think that it is easier to meet and become friends with the locals in Zaragoza than the ones in Madrid, but I am not sure.

Can someone help are the assumption I have made true? Should I go to Madrid the city I prefer or is it better to go Zaragoza the smaller city? If anyone has experienced (kind of) the same situation, what did you do? Why did you eventually choose the one above the other? Is it harder to become friends with the locals in Madrid or in big international cities in general compared to a smaller city? Any regrets? Experiences with other countries and languages are also welcome! Everything is helpful! 

TLDR; I'm going on a study abroad and my main focus is to improve my skills in the local language (Spanish) by meeting the locals, should I go the bigger city (Madrid) or the smaller one (Zaragoza).",1625662843,hous_jj,7,384,2011,95,20

Hey guys, 
I’m sure a bunch of people in this community are foreigners that don't speak the language but wish they did. 
I am ready to offer a solution were we can have daily scheduled individual calls, where you can start getting the feel of speaking in arabic, making a conversation and building a sentence step by step.
It's more of a chat session and less of a class. 
And if we call it a class, then it's far away from being syllabus based or boring, but rather a non traditional easy going way of learning the language. That you can easily add an hour for it in your day.

I'm a native Arabic speaker, lived in KSA for 17 years  and then moved to Turkey for my 5 university years and currently I live in Jordan.

I have been tutoring English offline back then till now, and just recently started tutoring Arabic as well, and want to spread my work here over reddit, with a very symbolic rate for sessions :)

**Japanese**-I have learned from apps but was only decent at knowing Hiragana and a couple words.I learnt this after getting inspired to learn it and even knew how to write some of the characters.My motivation was just me liking how it looked and sounded cool and was at its peak.What made me want to learn it more was Anime.Something I want to do in the future if I can get good at drawing. I stopped because I was too busy with a full time job so I was drained to learn but now I don’t have one.

languagelearning,What language should I pick next?? Japanese/Spanish? 3 Years after starting Korean..,"Native English speaker in the US and 38 years old. 

I had been studying Korean for about 3 years. Although, I have not studied very intensely for the last year. I have taken 5 university level Korean classes, along with a couple of continuing education classes. 

I made the most progress by memorizing flashcards with words and grammar points, using Pimsluer, 3 of the college classes were helpful, and using tutors on iTalki to practice speaking. 

Even after 3 years, I am far from fluent, but can have typical, very basic conversations. I've just kind of lost interest in Korean. There is a lot less learning material once you get past the beginner level. Watching TV or listening to podcasts in Korean is not helpful. I am not at that advanced of a level. Trying to bridge the gap to get there is certainly possible... but it will take a tremendous effort, and I'm not sure it's how I want to spend my time. 

Anyways, I have one more Korean class that's a month long starting next week. So, I intend to study and work hard for that class, but afterwards I want to start a new language. 

Obviously, I have an interest in Asian culture. I think Vietnamese is the most beautiful sounding language, but the pronunciation is crazy, and there will be much less learning material than what there is for Korean. 

So, I'm thinking of either Japanese or Spanish. Japanese, because I love Japanese culture and music. Spanish, because it is practical and so similar to English. Japanese would be more exciting, but maybe my brain needs a break and I should go with Spanish. Additionally, it would be a spring board to Italian, Portuguese, and other similar languages if I decided to learn them someday. The downside being, no one will be really surprised to see me speaking Spanish, on the other hand, when I (as a white American) speak an Asian language, it gets more attention. 

My concern with Japanese is the writing system. I don't even plan to try and learn Kanji...but would probably learn Hiragana and Katakana. I know they are more difficult than Hangul, but with several months of practice, I imagine I could get them down. Will not learning Kanji be a serious issue? I would plan to focus mainly on speaking/listening and not as much on reading/writing. My goal with Japanese would be to get more conversational than I currently am with Korean. For Spanish, I would desire to be pretty darn fluent. I would like to be able to watch TV shows, etc.. I should mention, even as an American, I have never studied Spanish before. 

As you can see, I am pretty torn between the two. Since I will likely be spending years on whatever I choose, I am trying to choose carefully - and then I want to go for it full blast. In case you're wondering, I don't want to study both at the same time. I have severe ADD as it is, and don't think I could focus well doing two languages at once. 

Any insight or suggestions would be appreciated!",1625605817,TerrifiedUSAMan,10,526,2933,84,12

languagelearning,I’m looking for a word for this teaching style (because I hate it),"I’ve had a few tutors try and do this with me, and I react really badly to it. But I don’t really know how to describe it. 

Basically, they focus very heavily on what I DONT know, instead of reinforcing what I do know (for me, there’s kind of a wobbly line between what I know and what I don’t know.  
for instance, i can have an idea of a grammatical concept but need practice using it in speech. Or, there are a lot of words I can write, but not understand out loud because I need to hear them being said. Id like to focus more positively  on this. You know? But I also DONT need them to explain it to me again. I need to use it) 

Today I had a lesson and basically the full hour was-

Tutor: do you know (word/phrase/idea)

Me: no….

Tutor: okay (quick explanation) do you know this?

Me: nope. 

Tutor: okay (quick explanation) do you know this? 

Me: no. 

And it’s not even things I would be reasonably assumed to know! It didn’t have anything to do with our previous lesson and I just got so disheartened because I spent ages studying this week. I thought I could come into the lesson with a lot of confidence, but I feel like this just pulled the rug out from under me. It’s exhausting to feel like a failure in every lesson. 

I tried to talk to her about it, but I don’t think she understood my English.  Also I’m not doing a great job of explaining it. 

I know tutors have to figure out what you do and don’t know. So I don’t mind this for a first lesson. But I strongly prefer it when they get a base line, and then move you into a text book, or just build skills with you.  You know? 

Is there a name for this? Has anyone else had this issue? How would you tell a prospective  tutor you don’t want that?  How would you succinctly explain the issue to a tutor you already have? (Who may not speak great English)",1625596262,ButterscotchOk8112,12,355,1827,66,13

languagelearning,Almost Native in English learning Spanish - How to remember grammar rules and vocabulary without Duolingo? Or should I just skip it since I know some of it?,"Folks I am at a crossroads of my Spanish learning journey. I have been using Duolingo a lot for the past 5 months or so and I have developed a small but significant vocabulary and knowledge of grammar from there. I have tested out and achieved the level 1 throughout the tree. Besides that, I am at level 4(orange) or better for almost all skills till checkpoint 4.

However, I have searched this sub and the r/LearnSpanish sub for reviews of Duolingo. Based on the user comments on those posts and my own experience, I can tell that Duolingo will not help me develop speaking fluency or even listening comprehension. Besides, Duolingo gets even worse after Checkpoint 5 - there are no tips along with the skills from that point onwards.

However, I am finding it difficult to retain vocabulary or grammar rules without practicing on Duolingo. I am exposed to grammar rules that I have not reached on Duolingo ( future tense , subjunctive) from Spanish native speakers on tandem and my italki tutors. But I don't get it to practice it hard and consequently, I forget it. I also tried Anki but I found it to be really boring. I am listening to Spanish content on youtube - Easy Spanish, Dreaming In Spanish - but again, there is no way to practice what I hear or read.

languagelearning,How I learn grammar and language systems (in a way that’s actually useful),"Hello everyone. I’ve been living outside of my home country and learning languages for about ten years now. I’m currently living in Jordan and actively learning Arabic (for about a year) and French (for about a month). For context, I’m also very comfortable in English, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, and German.

If you are enthusiastic about languages, people will often ask you “How do you learn a language?” or “What’s the best way to learn a language?” As we on this sub all know, there is not a straightforward answer. Clearly, direct context-rich, meaning-focused experience with the language is essential. This is what I often recommend to people. However, as a learner, I actually spend a lot of time (especially at the beginning) in grammar references, rote memorizing conjugations, and looking at vowel trapezoids and things like that. Basically, learning ABOUT the language’s systems and not exactly learning to USE the language.

Now this is something that I don’t usually recommend to people because it can be overwhelming. But if you have a special interest in language, a background in linguistics, or have experience learning languages, it might be useful to you. By having an understanding of the language systems, as you’re learning the actual language, it should help you better understand how what you’re learning fits into the system as a whole.

Let me explain what I mean using the two languages I’m learning now as examples. Already knowing Spanish and English, my progress in French has been very rapid. One of the first things I did was read through an entire grammar reference. Now this would be horrible advice for the average high school language student. But if you already have an understanding of how languages work, it can be helpful just to get a top down view of what the language can do/typically does. After, when you’re interacting with the language in more authentic contexts, you can have a context for the new language you’re seeing. You’re rarely puzzled or confused by what the language is doing because you have already seen what it can do, at least once.

So, for French, for the first 3 weeks I did:

1. 1.5 hours of Pimsleur listening lessons every day (to train my mouth to produce and my ears to perceive the sounds of French)

2. 1 hour of authentic material work (usually video games or movies, stopping to gather useful vocabulary or sentence structures when I feel like it. Otherwise, just general immersion)

3. 1 hour of Anki for vocab and rote memorization/recitation of verb structures

4. The rest of the time is reading through a grammar reference

The grammar reference helps give context to what I’m picking up from the other sources. Now, I’m only using authentic materials and speaking lessons to build up the SKILL of speaking French (because now I already basically have the KNOWLEDGE). So, after only 1 month I'm completely off learning materials and onto conversation practice and authentic materials. (This is only possible because of my previous knowledge of Spanish and English, two languages that are VERY similar to French. Learning languages usually takes a very long time, as we will see below. Also, I speak French very slowly. My ability to speak French is still poor, but improving rapidly because my KNOWLEDGE of French systems is robust).

It can be frustrating for learners at the beginning to communicate in meaning-focused contextually rich ways because you don’t have “all the language yet.” You haven’t studied the future tense or a particular past tense. But if you START with grammar, even if you don’t know it perfectly (you won’t), you will still have a FRAMEWORK for building your understanding when you encounter language in “the real world.” “What’s this? Oh okay, yeah, I remember this from the grammar reference. It’s cool to see it in context.”

Now, let’s see how this theory works with more challenging languages. Because I’m living in Jordan, the variety of Arabic that I’m learning is Southern Levantine Arabic. This poses many challenges that I won’t get into right here but, suffice it to say that it’s very difficult to find comprehensive grammar references or descriptions of Arabic OTHER than for the standard variety (Modern Standard Arabic, which is used in the news and in print, but unhelpfully not in the cafes or streets of Amman where I live). So essentially, there isn’t a grammar references for me to study from for the language that I’m learning.

So what I’m having to do is go through a Syrian Arabic textbook (which is Northern Levantine Arabic- similar but not identical to the variety I’m trying to learn), with a Jordanian teacher and essentially build my own grammar reference. This is painstaking work (but a labor of love if you think grammar is fun!). However, as I said above, for language people, I believe it’s a better approach than just listening to people and translating sentences with no framework. Because there aren’t any (really good, comprehensive) course books for the language I want to speak, building a framework is essential for contextualizing the natural language that I encounter every day. The alternative is just memorizing tens of thousands of words and phrases and trying to figure out a framework as you go.

languagelearning,Speakers of both Hindi and Bengali - Is it feasible to learn both concurrently or should they be learned one at a time?,"I'm moving to India in a few weeks and am interested in learning both Hindi and Bengali, mainly for the purpose of studying literature, poetry, and the arts.

I'm ambitious but I want to be realistic. Thanks so much!

Context:

\- I plan to learn with a tutor (who either teaches Hindi, or both Hindi and Bengali)

\- I'll mainly stay around the Hyderabad area, so I'll have easy Hindi practice (of course, more Urdu/Dakkani). 

\- I'm fluent in Telugu and many of the Sanskrit word roots. 

\- I'm a disciplined learner. I grew up learning spoken Telugu, but never to read or write.

linguistics,Is Korean developing negative concord?,"A recent post about negative concord inspired this post.

So, to express ""nobody, no one"" in Korean, you use the word 아무도 *amwu-two*:

* 나는 아무도 안 죽였다. *na-nun amwu-two an cwukyess-e.*  
  I-TOP *amwu-two* not killed-DECL  
  ""I killed no one.""

*amwu-two* is only used with negative verbs (if there is a verb in the sentence), which suggests that it's a negative polarity item (NPI), and that it holds no negation in itself. In this view, *amwu-two* can be translated to English ""anyone"": ""I did not kill anyone"" = ""I killed no one.""

However, let's look at another example:

* A: 누구를 죽였어? *nwukwu-lul cwukyess-e?*  
  who-ACC killed-INF  
  ""Who did you kill?""  
  B: 아무도. *amwu-two*.  
  ""No one.""

The word *amwu-two* is being used by itself without any verb to answer the question negatively, translated to ""No one"".

So is *amwu-two* a ""anyone"" or ""no one""? The two papers I could find [1][2] suggest that it's ""no one"", and it should be analyzed as a negative concord item (NCI) instead:

* 나는 아무도 안 죽였다. *na-nun amwu-two an cwukyess-e.*  
  I-TOP **no one** not killed-DECL = ""I didn't kill no one""  
  = ""I killed no one.""

However, most NCIs from other languages I know etymologically contain a negator morpheme, e.g. informal English ""nowhere"" (e.g. ""I'm not going nowhere"" = ""I'm not going anywhere"") contains the negator ""no"", and Russian ничего (e.g. Нина ничего не знала ""Nina didn't know anything (&lt;*nothing*)"") contains the negator ""ни"", ultimately from the same origin as English ""no"" (PIE *ne).

However, *amwu-two* does not. *amwu-two* consists of two morphemes, *amwu* (&lt; Middle Korean *amwo*), and *two*. The postposition *two* means something like ""even, also"" which is far from a negation. On the other hand, *amwu* can only be used with postpositions *two* or *na* attached, and when it's used with *na* ""just, or"" (also not a negation), the combined form *amwu-na* means ""anyone"", and is used positively:

* 아무나 골라. *amwu-na kwoll-a.*  
  *amwu-na* pick-INF  
  ""Pick anyone.""

So, did Korean ""invent"" a negative concord item from nothing (no negating morphemes involved)? Are there any examples like this in other languages?

linguistics,Can you guys help me under stand the issue of colors?? How can the same order of terms be always picked the same???,"there is a popular video on linguistcs about colors

there is this from the wiki pedia article

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_term

In short, their analysis showed that in a culture with only two terms, they would roughly correlate with 'dark' (covering black, dark colors, and cold colors such as blue) and 'bright' (covering white, light colors, and warm colors such as red). All languages with three colors terms add red to this distinction. Thus, the three most basic color terms are black, white, and red. Additional color terms are added in a fixed order as a language evolves: First, one of either green or yellow; then the other; then blue. All languages distinguishing six colors contain terms for black, white, red, green, yellow, and blue. These colors roughly correspond to the sensitivities of the retinal ganglion cells, leading Berlin and Kay to argue that color naming is not merely a cultural phenomenon, but is one that is also constrained by biology—that is, language is shaped by perception. A 2012 study[10] suggested that the origin of this hierarchy may be tied to human vision and the time ordering in which these color names get accepted or agreed upon in a population perfectly matches the order predicted by the hierarchy.

very hard for me to understand this??..

you walk around and see color every where- blue sky green grass every thing..

i know we are all human so we all have a shared view of the world around us BUT it is hard to understand how you can be somehow 'forced' (like by magic??) to pick the certain colors for your color terms in that certain order????

nothing stops you from looking up at the sky and seeing blue and naming blue as your first color term 

and it is true also nothing stops you from looking at the grass and seeing green and naming green as your first color term

linguistics,Is the English language starting to become more agglutinative?,"The other day, I was scrolling another sub on Reddit, where a user complained, with regards to another website altogether, that after making a comment the moderators didn't approve of, he had been ""InstapermashadowIPbanned.""

(i.e. Instantly banned permanently, on the basis of his IP address rather than username, but without being informed that other people could no longer see his posts)

15 years ago, such a word would not exist, and if you could magically travel back in time and ask people in 2006 what it meant, most would have practically no idea what you were talking about. Even today, many people in the older generations and those who don't use the Internet much, would struggle to understand. But for those who use social media regularly, the meaning is clear. And while the word is currently clearly rooted in the domain of Internet slang and would not be used in any formal discussion, new words and mechanisms of speech often start out as informal jargon, before slowly permeating their way into formal speech which tends to be more conservative.

Such a level of agglutination, with 4 prefixes preceding the main morpheme (""ban""), in additional to the -ed past tense suffix, is unusual in English, but has started to become more common in certain Internet slang words, so far confined mostly to the online sphere. However, that may change over time as the language evolves, and the Internet becomes even more integrated into daily life.

Also, according to theories of language evolution, the morphology of a language changes in a cyclical fashion over time. Languages ""start out"" with an agglutinative morphology, which over time becomes fusional, then analytic, and finally isolating, before returning back to an agglutinative state, restarting the cycle. While English is not an entirely isolating languages (languages that isolate more than English include Vietnamese, Yoruba, and Afrikaans), it is more analytic than most Indoeuropean languages, and thus at some point agglutinative tendencies may become more prominent. So could the use of these longer words be the first sign of a proces, that could admittedly take several centuries, of English evolving into a more agglutinative state? Will future speakers of a much more agglutinative English consider the current period to be the beginning of English's evolution into an agglutinative language?

linguistics,"This week's Q&amp;A thread -- please read before asking or answering a question! - August 30, 2021","Do you have a question about language or linguistics? You’ve come to the right subreddit! We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1630321214,AutoModerator,161,479,2762,98,17
linguistics,"Changing accents as a young adult, especially between two native accents","I'm an Australian who has lived here in Australia for 6 years now, from when I was 14, and I'm nearly 21 now. Before that, I spent my entire childhood in the UAE, and due to the incredibly multicultural atmosphere there, and speaking a non-English language at home, my accent in English ended up closest to American. I'm not American, and have never visited the US.

Over the 6 years in Australia, I believe I've adopted a few parts of the Australian accent, but for the most part it's stayed closest to that US West Coast accent that Hollywood ingrained into me. For reference most Australians ask me if I'm Canadian when they hear me speak.

I've spent the majority of my teens here, and yet the accent shift has been minimal. I really hate having the accent of a country I have absolutely nothing to do with, and I want my natural accent to become as Australian as possible by default (without having to consciously maintain it). Does anyone have any experiences like this, or know if this is feasible?",1630320338,Agpaitin,2,181,1005,72,11
linguistics,parts of stem reanalyzed as affixes,"So a while ago I checked, as a part of work avoiding behavior, the etymology of the Dutch plural markers, and one, -en, comes from the plural ending of the so-called weak nouns. The Germanic weak nouns in turn come from nouns that ended in an /n/ in PIE. However, in Middle Dutch these nouns had lost all their PIE endings, and in some cases also the /n/ of the stem, but on others (including all plural forms) the /n/ remained. This -(e)n ending was then reanalyzed as a plural. Another plural marker in Dutch is -eren, which is a double plural marker, the -en just discussed, and -er, and it seems that in German, and presumably in Dutch, the ending -er comes from nouns ending in os/es in PIE, where the -os was lost, and the -es was reanalyzed as a plural suffix.  Now, strictly speaking, the -os/es ending is a derivational suffix (as far as I know) making neuter nouns out of some stems, and a lot of weak nouns may also come from derivational suffixes ending in an /n/. Also, already in PIE those derivational suffixes had different forms depending on the grammatical context, which may have helped the reanalysis as inflectional suffixes.

I just wondered how common this is. I think the most common story you hear about the origin of plural affixes is that they come from a grammaticalized word for ""more"" or another related meaning, or at least, if someone were to ask me as a linguist what the origin of plural markers in general was I would give that answer. In general, grammaticalization of words to inflectional is the main source for affixes. But maybe this reanalysis might be more common than you'd think (I  think that the Romanian suffix -uri could also be the result of a similar reanalysis of Latin words ending in -us/-or- for instance). I also wonder if there are similar cases other than plural markers.",1630318553,merijn2,1,327,1828,35,6

linguistics,language varieties that are languages?,"Language varieties :
Any set of linguistic forms which patterns according to social factors: i.e. used under specific social circumstances. The term includes different accents, different linguistic  styles, different dialects and even different languages which contrast with each other for social reasons.

Language :a language can be thought of as a collection of dialects that are usually linguistically similar, used by different social groups who choose to say that they are speakers of one language which functions to unite and represent them to other groups.

Pidgin :
A pidgin is a language which has no native speakers.

Creole :
A pidgin which has acquired native speakers and has consequently expanded in structure (grammar and vocabulary) in order to express the range of meanings and functions required of a first language.

Lingua franca:
A language serving as a means of 
communication between speakers whose first languages differ.

Standard variety / Standard Language / Standard dialect :
Language variety which generally has a written form and which has undergone some degree of codification. It is the variety taught in schools and has high prestige. It is generally regarded by the community as the ‘correct’ variety.

Nonstandard dialect / Vernacular dialect :
Linguistic forms or varieties that do not conform to the standard.

These definitions are from An Introduction to Sociolinguistics by Janet Holmes and Nick Wilson.

I know pidgin, creole, lingua franca, standard dialect and vernacular dialect are all language varieties, but are they languages?",1630282460,namelessnadir,2,244,1582,38,5
linguistics,Spoken Language Speed and Linguistic Relativity,"Just a moment ago I was listening to native Spanish speakers (specifically speakers in Mexico City) for some immersion learning (ok, and because it was a cooking video), but it made me stop and think.  Some languages when spoken by native speakers, are lightning fast.  Even I, a native English speaker, seem to have a kind of speed limiter that requires words to be spoken relatively slowly when to other languages.

As some or maybe most of you are aware, linguistic relativity suggests that the way we think is shaped by our primary mode of communication, particularly in spoken and written language.  Listening to the gentleman go through an entire dialogue at a mile a minute caused me to wonder, do people whose native languages are spoken at a faster pace *think* and *comprehend* faster?  Perhaps this is the wrong place to pose this question, and if so, please direct me to where I should seek answers.

But I am curious.  I would further question whether invented languages and native speakers of those could be influenced to become lightning fast thinkers.",1630270013,isaacaschmitt,7,181,1067,47,6

I've seen these changes described as ""irregular"". If so, would it (not) indicate a possible original OT contrast between fortis/lenis that was neutralized elsewhere? Even if OT writing did not consistently reflect this distinction, it was still possible that OT had a different sort of opposition than voicing (even if just word-initially so), which was what their adopted script reflected, and hence such an opposition was not reflected in writing (cf. Japanese transcribing Korean lax consonants as voiced only medially).",1630249568,Rethliopuks,2,118,770,57,10

Ot blinks of an eye, coughs etc.

It's use, when you can't talk publicly, or hear too well.

Eg, 2 .. 3, meaning I initiate it, the other person can then do 3 .. 2, as in, I understand. dots meaning pauses.

Maybe a sign off too, 3 .. 1 as in 'over and out'.

It's potential use...

Is this some kind of universal (that I can't find)? Universals about POA's for stops seem to be focussed on the fact that languages tend to miss p or g, if they miss one of p t k b d g. But if a language has b t k as their stop series, that still makes three places of articulation.

But then on the other hand, Hawaiian has p t/k ʔ: one of p t k is missing (which one depends on the variety), but it has a glottal stop. So tadaa, three POA's :-p

I would love to find counterexamples. Or if someone could point me to the linguistic universal that solves this question, that would be great :)

linguistics,"Is there anything on English pronunciation of *consonant* 〈y〉, /j/, and how its realization might vary across regional accents?","I think it is fairly well established that on paper, Standard English and all its varieties, the _consonant_ 〈y〉 is always realised as /j/.
However, I am reading Dr. David Crystal's excellent book, _Think on my Words_, in which he takes on the rather large task of giving a general introduction to the 10% or so difference in vocabulary, 5% difference in grammar, and 70% (hyperbole) difference in pronunciation of OP, as well as go over manuscript variation, spelling conventions, etc.
And in his book, he writes just as a gloss, about 〈i〉 vs. 〈j〉 (as they were not distinguished until around the 1620's, in English):

&gt; A similar trend affected _i_ and _j_ \[similar trend to how 〈u〉 became solely vsed as a vowel and how 〈v〉 became solely vsed as consonant\].
&gt; The _i_ symbols, wether short 〈i〉 or elongated 〈j〉, were used both for a vowel **(with the sound of the modern** _**y**_ **in** ***yes***) and for the consanant (as in modern _j_ in _judge_).

Now, I don't want to get to much in pronunciation quirks according to individuals—anecdotes.
I could tell you right now, that I often believe I pronounce 〈y〉 as a consonant as \[ɪ\].
When I stress it, I often pronounce it as \[ç~ʝ\] and \[ʑ\], and I also do pronounce it as the usual approximant \[j̥~j\].
In fact, I often unvoice voiced consonants word initially.
But I have strayed from my point.

I recognize that we mishear things.
And even worse, we mistranscribe things, even our very tongues, if we are not careful.
Especially lacking experience.
But I do believe I have heard this before in speech, indeed even Crystal's speech.
I am decently familiar with Turkic languages, which usually can't allow diphthongs, and as such combinations that in English might be rendered as /aɪ/, /ɔɪ/, and /wi~ui/ can only rendered in Turkic language _B_ as /ɑjĕ/, /ojĕ/, and /ujĕ/.
It is distantly related, but many English speakers, because long vowels can only occur before voiced consonants, a word like _see_, where you actually have a ""tru"" _long-vowel_, it becomes realised as \[sij\] to those like me who put the long ""vowel"" there, and \[si\] in unstressed positions.

That said, I don't think I am mishearing anything, but I am curious if there has been any analysis of this—I am sure there has.",1630032587,MrRichBOB,6,390,2265,127,19

linguistics,Linguistics study/career advice for a Philosophy student,"I am 20 years old and I'm currently studying an undergraduate degree in philosophy (in a few weeks I will start my second year, still three to go). I am really interested in languages, both in learning them (learn to use them) and learning its linguistic features (grammar, syntax, etc). I love my current philosophy degree, but I've realised that in the future I'd like to have a job that lets me learn and practice languages, or at least something related to languages. I am thinking about becoming a teacher, either of my native Spanish or of any other language that I learn (so far I can speak English and I'm working to get my German to the next level, but in the future I'd like to learn to her languages too). 

I'm basically wondering which would be the best way to work on that wish, given that I am already in Philosophy. Giving up the degree is not an option I truly consider (unless it is the only way), because I already gave one and I don't really feel like doing it again; so I want to finish it. But afterwards, what is the best way to become a language teacher? Should I do a Master on Linguistics or something less academical, related to teaching or teaching languages? This way I would try to work as a language teacher but with a mainly philosophical education. On the contrary, should I begin another undergraduate degree (after I finish Philosophy) so that I can build a proper linguistic career? Is Linguistics what I should be studying or it's better to choose a language an study Philology if you're gonna be a teacher?

I would like to spend this next 3 years bettering my language skills, so that I can start studying linguistics (or whatever it finally is) with a good knowledge of at least 3-4 languages as a foundation. I understand linguistics it's not (necessarily) about learning languages, but I do love doing that and it would be great to combine the two. I don't want to miss the linguistic approach either, I really enjoy learning about how language works in general.

If someone has got experience regarding how is he field's situation in Spain, I'd love to hear it too. Anyway, I'm open to consider other countries if their studying programms are suggested.

linguistics,There is no difference between /tʲ/ and /c/?," I'm a native Russian speaker, and, as you may know, the /t/ sound in Russian is dental, as well as /d/ and /n/. The majority of consonants have their soft (palatallized) counterparts: /m/\~/mʲ/, /f/\~/fʲ/. Everything is more or less understandable, but when it comes to dental stops, weird things start to happen. On [ru.wiktionary.org](https://ru.wiktionary.org/) the word ""дети"" (""deti"") is marked to be pronounced as \[ˈdʲetʲɪ\]. From that, one could say that you're supposed to pronounce the sounds in this case as pallatalized dental stops. But nobody actually pronounces it this way. In fact, pronouncing it as pallatalized dentals would sound like an accent. To me, the sound appears closer to \[ˈɟecɪ\], where the sounds are pallatal stops and not palatalized dental stops. I never heard any native speaker pronounce it with palatallized dental stops, instead palatal stops. Listening to the audio samples of the sounds on Wikipedia only confirms it.

So, I'm asking you to help me understand whether I'm missing something after all or there is in fact something wrong or deliberately ambiguous with the transcription. In Western European languages, palatal stops occur as palarallized counterparts for velar stops (k ,g). But I don't see the difference between the sound \[ɟ\] in the Hungarian word &lt;magyar&gt; \[ˈmɒɟɒr\] and the Russian sound \[dʲ\] in the word &lt;дети&gt; \[ˈdʲetʲɪ\].",1629989906,fixion_generator,55,218,1401,44,8

linguistics,What kind of doctor can I seek that will help identify my speech problems?,"Background: I am a 28F that is hearing impaired. Completely deaf in my right ear since either birth or young age (my doctor when I was young was unsure since it was discovered a bit late).

I remember taking ESL classes in elementary school but it was only for a year. Since then, I have not had anything else. 

I get my hearing tested by audiologist every 2 years and have been since childhood. I have never had any hearing aids growing up. My original ENT doctor retired during my childhood years. The new one I’ve been seeing after him, always told me “you don’t qualify for hearing aids.” It wasn’t until this February that I told my audiologist what my ENT doctor has told me and asked if this is true. She was so shocked, the look on her face of disgust. I will never forget. She said “….you do qualify for hearing aids. You NEED hearing aids. You have missed out on a lot over the years. Hearing aids will help with you so much.” She did explain it won’t totally improve my hearing but that I won’t further miss out. 

I confronted my ENT and he seemed annoyed that I wanted to try hearing aids. I finally got them and I’m still adjusting to them.

I believe due to this, it has caused me to have speech issues. I do have difficult with comprehension (says in my childhood doctors notes). But I have noticed growing up, I have difficulty finding words when speaking. What I want to say, sounds good in my head but when I speak, I sound stupid. I don’t stutter. People look at me stupid when I am trying to explain something to am telling a story.

My doctor has not given me any guidance on who I can seek help from with this. I have no ideas who specializes in this.

Anyone else have this same issue that is hearing impaired? I feel stupid and have always had problems doing speeches in school. I hate doing speech because of these issues.

linguistics,Transgender Nouns???,"I noticed a sign in the restroom today stating: ""Manos limpias te protectan"" something like that. 

Context for non Spanish speakers = ""mano"" (hand) is feminine, though feminine words typically end in an ""a"". So... it's ""la"" mano, even though students of Spanish (and perhaps young children) mistake it as ""el mano"" 

In Spanish, and likely all gendered languages, irregular verbs are common. And, at least in Spanish, the phrase ""la mano"" is common enough, that native speakers tend to remember it's actually feminine, even though it sounds masculine. 

However, w/ the adjective after the verb ""limpia"", it struck me that ""manos limpios"" (masculine) rolled off the tongue much better. Not only does ""manos limpios"" sound correct ""from a gendered nouns perspective"" it also rhymes, which could be a cause for phonetic shifts. 

So... question time... 

In gendered languages, is there any evidence of irregular nouns ""changing"" genders over the years? 

I could easily imagine ""mano"" becoming masculine, with no ambiguity or communication errors arising.

linguistics,Query on known v. unknown subjects as linguistic categories (with applications to singular they),"Apologies for clumsy phrasing in the question; I don't have any formal training in linguistics and am doing my best to get at a murky problem I've been mulling. My best attempt at direct phrasing is, ""Is there evidence for 'known/identified subjects/referents' and 'unknown/unidentified subjects/referents' as linguistic categories in natural languages?""

&amp;#x200B;

For context, I've noticed something of a paradox by which most folks intuitively use the singular *they* when talking about an unidentified subject (e.g. ""My doctor called me."" ""Oh, what'd they say?"") but encounter a cognitive barrier with using it for identified subjects, more in output than in understanding (i.e., they'll understand the sentence ""My partner Sam said they're coming into town tomorrow"", but be unlikely to reproduce the pronoun usage in a reply). Aside from attitudes about trans and nonbinary people, including transphobia, are there cognitive linguistic reasons for this difficulty? 

&amp;#x200B;

In my experience, there's an evolving social dimension to this question. [Some have argued](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/5dqz2k/singular_they_starting_to_replace_he_and_she_when/) that the singular *they* is used only for unknown or nonspecific subjects. Others will argue that there is no such distinction, either historically or presently, and attribute any difficulty to ideological (rather than linguistic) origins. Middle ground exists as well.

linguistics,Levelling Up English,"Hello! I'm an English teacher from Sheffield, UK. 

I've done some research into 'non-standard' language and regional dialects and accents, especially their role in the education system. 

This is (quite a long) blog I've written about these issues in the regions of England, and education and language policy. It touches on things like Brexit, 'levelling up', inequalities, devolution, and proposes some different policy approaches.

Hope it's not too sociolinguistic or political for this sub. Comment and criticisms very welcome.

linguistics,"The pronunciation of ""T"" being wrong very often in IPA or other pronunciation guides","I expect that this applies much more broadly, but all I can speak for is places near where I live (Northeast US). IPA guides for many words, including the example I'll use here, which is Connecticut, appear to often vary multiple times from the actual pronunciation, especially with the letter ""T"".

The name Connecticut can be found in all sources as being pronounced ""/kəˈnɛtɪkət/"" (or some other way of writing the same pronunciation outside of the IPA).

However, I and the several people I asked from the state all pronounce it ""/kəˈnɛdɪkɪʔ/"", which you can see varies in 3 different places from the suppose pronuncation.

One of them, the /ə/ as an /ɪ/, is a simple difference in vowel pronunciation, but the other 2 are concerning the letter ""t"" and its pronunciation, not only in General American English, but in British English as well.

&amp;#x200B;

This made me look through several other locations, and wherever the ""T"" was alone in the middle or end of a word, it was written as /t/, even though in most accents of English it wouldn't be pronounced as such.

When ""T"" is found in the middle of a word alone in GA, it is pronounced /d/, and when it is found at the end of the word, it is pronounced /ʔ/. In much of Britain and Australia, both are /ʔ/.

Yet somehow, pronunciation guides almost always show ""T"" as being solely as /t/.

&amp;#x200B;

How and why do pronunciation guides so often make this error? The IPA guides at least must be written with at least moderate linguistic knowledge, so making the blunder almost everywhere can't be a simple matter of mistake. What am I missing?",1629787593,fmwb,14,282,1604,84,14

chomsky said this

There is interesting work on precepts for language use under particular conditions—notably intent to be informative, as in neo-Gricean pragmatics—but it is not at all clear how far this extends to the normal use of language, and in any event, it does not approach the Cartesian questions of creative use, which remains as much of a mystery now as it did centuries ago, and may turn out to be one of those ultimate secrets that ever will remain in obscurity, impenetrable to human intelligence.

a friend- who has a phd- said this

I *think* chomsky is just saying that if you limit accounts of use to contexts where the Gricean idealizations apply, then you might be able to say some interesting things about assertion and implicature. My *guess* is that he's thinking about Danny Fox and Gennaro Chierchia here, since they stay pretty close to syntax.

But the Gricean idealizations may apply only to a fragment of ""the normal use of language.""

anyway it sounds very cool and fancy so im curious about it..

linguistics,Terms of address used in British gay speech 1890s-1950s,"In Wilde’s “the picture of Dorian Gray” (1890s) and in Waugh’s “Brideshead Revisited” (male) queer characters use  the term of address “my dear” for other men, which arguably helps to signal their queerness to readers in the know. I’m thinking specifically of Anthony Blanche in ‘Brideshead’ Henry in ‘Dorian’. I want to say that men using “my dear” or other terms of address that can have either a feminine quality or romantic quality to them in order to address other men historically (and even now) acts as a ‘tell’ or signal of their queerness. It’s understated but obvious at the same time. And it stands in contrast to the very British and historical “my dear [friend/man/first name/nickname]” which was widespread and used by heteronormative identified men for their friends with sincerity or as a way to belittle acquaintances or strangers (used with Sarcasm). But I’ve been unable to find anything by linguists or those interested in gay language or speech patterns about this. And most stuff I can find is american.

linguistics,"This week's Q&amp;A thread -- please read before asking or answering a question! - August 23, 2021","Do you have a question about language or linguistics? You’ve come to the right subreddit! We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1629716419,AutoModerator,185,479,2762,98,17

I can't get my head around distribution and allophones. So if we put the two words next to eachother, a speaker knows that they have different meanings.

linguistics,Which languages are 'outliers' in different ways??,"i guess that there is maybe no way to say which languages are the most 'interesting' or most 'weird'- what would be the metric- and yet you can pick some metrics and then pick the languages that are truly objective outliers on those metrics??

for example i heard that hawaiian has only twelve phonemes or something like that which would - i guess - make that language a outlier in a objective way ... ON THE SPECIFIC metric of phonemes....it doesnt mean the language is a outleir in OTHER ways 

another one is piraha - a language everyone talks about..there is a lot of controversy about this language....i do not know if its true this language is different from other languages similar to piraha- and the other thing is that maybe ALL of the languages in pirahas 'family' are ALL similar to each other but ALL of them are 'outliers' from languages not in that family

i heard it is not unusual for languages to lack numberals in the way that piraha does..see my friends following comment 

Ken Hale worked with many (mostly Australian indigenous) languages that lack numbers beyond 3 or 4 and colors.  He showed that they lack the words, but have the concepts.  Thus they lack red, but have blood-like.  As for numbers, when they enter a market society they function fine.

It’s been known for 70 years, since Lenneberg’s original work on linguistic relativity, that having the words provides cues that facilitate memory and recognition.  Thus if you have the words “red” and “orange” you’re better at remembering color chips at the boundary – as would be expected.

and my friend has harsh words about piraha saying that the following paper shows that there is nothing truly special about this language- it is all hype

http://lingphil.mit.edu/papers/pesetsk/Nevins_Pesetsky_Rodrigues_2_Evidence_and_Argumentation_Reply_to_Everett.pdf

she is very harsh about this and says this about it

The language seems no different from many others, apart from the highly successful scam.

Every language is interesting. What’s interesting about Piraha is that so many people fall for the scam. 

but i want obviously i want to see the facts so if there is a paper- particular paper you can cite not a vague comment but a real paper reference- that i can look at and show to her then that would be useful to show that this language is truthfully an outlier in some metric or another",1629702029,LinguisticsTurtle,57,400,2375,50,7

I heard some letters started representing two sounds when Arabic got additional letters over the semetic language(like how ذ was added and given the same shape as د) so that explains why some symbols denoted 2 sounds but other sounds were always there in the semetic language yet just became one symbol in Arabic so why is that and what is the basis that relates them(like د and ذ are close in pronunciation but not ب and ت and ث).",1629630409,MegaMoh,8,187,944,211,36

Part of that game is using gathered magical runes to cast spells by combining them in groups of ideas - i.e. putting up a barrier around you by combining the protect and area runes.

The Pirahã language is most notable as the subject of various controversial claims;[1] for example, that it provides evidence for linguistic relativity.[2] The controversy is compounded by the sheer difficulty of learning the language; the number of linguists with field experience in Pirahã is very small.

another question..why is this 'piraha' language so hard to learn?? is it one of the hardest on earth to learn???

how do you get by without color words??

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirah%C3%A3_language

There is also a claim that Pirahã lacks any unique color terminology, being one of the few cultures (mostly in the Amazon basin and New Guinea) that only have specific words for light and dark.[a][6]

linguistics,Has there been any studies on the changing connotation of certain words and how that affects similar words and/or our perception of society associated with it?,"For example, when I was younger, I feel as if the word “abuse” was reserved for some truly awful acts. But nowadays, it has expanded to include things that are much more mild. Such as how lying to your partner might make someone call you emotionally abusive. Not to say these acts are okay— far from it— but the connotation of the word has shifted. 

Has there been any studies/articles detailing the effects of changing connotations and how it affects similar words? E.g has the connotation of “harassment” changed as “abuse” did? Similarly, how has it had its affects on society? When people think of an abuser, what type of person do they imagine and how is it different from an abuser from 20 years ago?

*  FUCK appears to have overtaken BLOODY as the most popular swear word in casual conversation.
* SHIT is one of only two swear words to have increased in usage over time, despite the overall decline in swearing.
* it may be not only the strength but also the ‘purity’ of swear words that distinguishes male and female swearing occurrence.

linguistics,Why don't any French adjectives end in /m/ or /ɲ/?,"In French, when we add suffixes that start with a vowel to words that end in a nasal vowel, the nasal vowel becomes an oral vowel and one of the three French nasal consonants: /m/, /n/ and /ɲ/. Examples are ""nom"" /nɔ̃/ &gt; ""nommer"" /nɔ.me/, ""son"" /sɔ̃/ &gt; ""sonner"" /sɔ.ne/ and ""loin"" /lwɛ̃/ &gt; ""éloigner"" /e.lwa.ɲe/. This is also the way to indicate the feminine with many adjectives, like ""fin"" /fɛ̃/ &gt; ""fine"" /fin/ and even the indefinite article ""un"" /œ̃/ &gt; ""une"" /yn/. 

This is because French nasal vowels originated from a nasal consonant that nasalized the preceding vowel, then disappeared in coda position. But, if there is a following vowel, the nasal isn't in coda position, so the same changes didn't happen, and the historic nasal and oral vowel are revealed. 

However, with adjectives, we don't find any examples of a historic /m/ or /ɲ/ that reappears when we add the feminine suffix. This means that the only option when an adjective ends in a nasal vowel is that there is an /n/. 

Perhaps this is an example of regularization, but I doubt that since I've looked that the etymology of many French words, and haven't found a single example, nor have I found any documentation for it. There's also no explanation in [Wikipedia's article of French sound changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonological_history_of_French).",1629216022,markrocks-,18,221,1351,50,10

linguistics,One parent - two languages? Raising a quadrilingual child?," 

Hi all,

I just stumbled upon this subreddit and am wondering if any of you had any advice to give. My wife and I are expecting and we are just getting started researching what may be the best strategy for our newborn.

For background: I am bilingual German-French and my wife is Spanish speaking. We live in the U.S., so the ""outside world"" language is English (with plenty of Spanish, but still majority English). My wife and I speak Spanish to each other.

We are 100% sure that we want to raise our kid multilingual, and that my wife will speak Spanish to the child. The question I have is whether I should focus on one language, meaning I choose French or German and speak this exclusively, or whether I could actually speak two languages (French and German) to the kid. I haven't researched this a great deal yet, as we still have 6 months to go, but I would love to hear from some parents if they had any experience with speaking two languages to their child, knowing that the child will already be exposed to another two languages - Spanish from the mother and English from the outside world, nursery, etc.... I am thinking I could speak one week French, one week German, but obviously don't want to overwhelm the kid.....

Any thoughts, comments, appreciated!",1629202972,GlobalEstate6,2,227,1271,58,9

linguistics,About Mongolic....,"So I was just browsing Wikipedia and I like language families and all the hypotheses. I am a off and on biblical literalist (I debate it myself) for context so I always feel language families can be grouped. With that in mind my mindset is more practical and I don't believe in discredited groupings such as Altaic, and I am not going to go all Conservative on you in any discussion, as obviously it should be discussed in a secular manner and approached as such. I'm just disclosing my own potential biases.

With that context out of the way, let me delve into this as a amateur hobbyist. I'm typing on phone so pardon my lack of link, and it's just a question anyway

I ask what language families does it seem closely related to? 
Initially I considered Proto-Sino Tibetan however among further study, it has more geographically in common with the Indo European languages, and religiously as well. However that doesn't feel quite right. 
Genetically, wouldn't they, if from Proto Proto Indo European, be more white(I admit I don't exactly know how that works), but we don't to my knowledge have any DNA evidence.
Thus,  that feels odd. 

Yenisean and Tungusic lack much evidence. Turkic has some similarities. 

However after scrolling through a lot, I would like to ask the possibility of a Koreanic connection. This admittedly lacks much evidence whatsoever, however studying the Mongolic, Turkic, and Koreanic, there seem to be links, though not enough nearly to justify a Altaic family.

I'm not really coming into this with anything in mind except having been interested in this, so this is more of a question and not a hypothesis. As a filthy casual, I would like to hear some discussion on this to better understand that ill defined area.
Do we know the languages of the people that the Mongols descended from? Is there any discernible lineage? I know Proto Mongolic is debated, but do we have any idea of who they were, even if not what they spoke?

linguistics,"Is the concept of individual words innate to human language, or does it arise as a result of written language?","We can very intuitively pick out what makes up a single word in our language ... or at least most of the time. Highschool is one word but ice cream isn't, even though the stress pattern is the same and they're both compound nouns. This can be hard to predict and I second guess myself (of course this is anecdotal but it makes me wonder).

So, is it writing that makes a word a word? Can illiterate people discern what a single word is as easily?

languages with different levels of synthesis have vastly different boundaries for where words begin. Polysynthetic languages count whole sentences at words, but do they? Why couldn't 'inuktitusunguvit' (do you speak inuktitut, probably spelling it wrong) be spelled 'inuktitu su ngu viit'? the typical answer is that the individual parts it the word change from the roots, but in what way is this different from inflection? su could be described as a form of 'suuq' depending where it occurs in an utterance. (in the above word/ sentence suuq becomes su in that context, disclaimer: I don't speak inuktitut) Why is suuq becoming su grounds for it not being a word because of its dependency on surrounding sounds, why not the indefinite a/an in english? 

I suppose what makes a word a word is the underlying stress patterns, but Is this universally recognized? Why would the concept of a single word as we know it mean anything to an illiterate speaker of a polysynthetic language? Wouldn't they be more likely to understand their language in terms of the individual roots? 

How much research has been conducted on how language itself is perceived by speakers of very different languages, as well as illiterate people and people of varying socioeconomic status?

It wouldn't surprise me if many languages had no word for 'word', and what we've translated into english and the modern written world was something different.

I could be wrong though. Does anyone know much about all this?",1629146709,Strobro3,45,331,1934,110,20
linguistics,How trustworthy is Ethnologue?,"I'm getting seemingly inconsistent statements from a paper and from Ethnologue.

Bennett et al. (2015) say:

&gt; Official census estimates suggest that about 40% of Guatemalans speak a Mayan language natively; this almost certainly underestimates the actual percentage of native Mayan speakers in the country, **which is likely 50–60% or higher** (Fischer and Brown, 1996a; England 2003)

(emph added)

In contrast, Ethnologue 2021 says this about Spanish:

&gt; Spanish [spa] (Castellano, Español). Autonym: Castellano, Español. Users: 15,840,000 in Guatemala, all users. **L1 users: 12,100,000 in Guatemala** (2018 World Factbook). **L2 users: 3,740,000 (2018)**

(emph added)

So Ethnologue says that only 23.6% of Guatemalans speak a language other than Spanish as L1. 

How do I explain this apparent discrepancy? Does it have to do with a distinction between “native language” and “L1”? Is it just that Ethnologue has a more recent source? Is such a big difference (50-60% down to 23%) possible?

When a great scientist leaves us, the temptation is strong to say that she was a giant in her field. That doesn’t quite work for Lila Gleitman. The study of language acquisition, her primary scientific concern, was her field in a special sense: she virtually created the field in its modern for and led in its impressive development ever since.
 
Others had studied child language, but Lila was really the first to raise probing questions about what children know and how that knowledge is attained, questions informed by theoretical understanding and directed to issues of far-reaching importance. More than that, Lila developed elegant experiments to answer these questions, devising models that have guided experimental research throughout the years.
 
Many of the conclusions that Lila firmly established are quite startling. She and others working under her guidance were able to show that the child attains rich knowledge on the basis of very slight data, far beyond what the very young child exhibits in performance, suggesting that the data serve in fundamental ways as a triggering device. Her research also elucidates the means by which this remarkable achievement takes place.
 
Lila’s work constitutes a fundamental and highly original contribution not only to the study of language and its acquisition, but to the understanding of the human mind and its unique capacities far more generally.
 
Another reason why it is hard for me to write about Lila’s leaving us is that she was a close personal friend for 60 years. But those feelings hold for just about everyone who was lucky enough to have known her. Lila was one of those rare people who becomes a close friend virtually on first contact — an immediate reaction to her warmth, her wit, her sympathetic understanding. These qualities persisted unchanged, even amplified, through adversity that seemed only to heighten her rare personal qualities. It made her seem immortal.
 
And in important ways, she is.

Lila Gleitman died a week ago Sunday, a sad event for everybody who knew her as well as our field. Lila had an extremely distinguished career in the study of language. It is not easy to think of a more distinguished psycholinguist. Her work was always characterized by an intense focus on careful and telling empirical analysis of fundamental issues. She never forgot her linguistic roots, and this interaction helped to mold her career’s work.
 
Her career is full of probing experimental questions on the most important issues. Who can forget her beautiful experimental take-down of the famous claims of Amos Tversky and his colleagues that seemingly precise terms were actually represented in the human mind in a much more approximate way, with all sorts of strange results. This extended all the way to the number system. “Which numeral is the most odd?” was an answerable experimental question in the view she was arguing against, a view that was beginning to dominate the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology at the time. Lila knew that how you asked a question was as important as the statistical analysis of results.
 
When I searched the literature for useable studies of the linguistic input to the child developing language for my 1980 book with Peter Culicover, the most useful and careful one I could find was the beautiful empirical demonstration by Elissa Newport, Henry Gleitman and Lila that the input didn’t include a kind of “teaching language,” contra to the standard psychological claim at the time. This helped to establish the need for the child to have some prior knowledge of the nature of language. She pushed the view that the input to the child was extensively from surface information, reflecting, I believe, her studies with Harris with its emphases on distributional analysis. She produced quite a few empirical demonstrations of how this input could be used. In a beautifully simple experiment, she showed that even adults (and thus presumably children) couldn’t figure out the meaning of a verb from context, although they could for nouns. In Noam Chomsky’s terms the meaning of a verb is then not “epistemologically available.”
 
My comments barely scratch the surface of Lila’s work. She produced generations of students who filled psychology departments around the country and who were strongly devoted to her. When we first met we hit it off instantly, becoming good friends. I will miss her and her constant interest, ideas, conversations, work and general support for our great enterprise. Who will be that thinking psychologist who allows for the hope of integration of our fields?

linguistics,"Instead of Changing English Spelling, What If We Teach the Dialect of Standard English alongside Someone’s Regional Dialect?","From what I can tell, there are certain orthographic clues in written Standard English that evince the sounds words should make. As an example, I highlight the use of yods.

In written Standard English, there are various orthographic clues that a yod is present in a word, including but not limited to the following:

XCion, like union, nation, and mission

XuiX, like suit

XueX, like fuel

XuCV, like pure or yule 

Xew, like new or few or ewe.

where X is any given letter or string of letters in English including the null string, C is any given consonant, and V is any given vowel.

I find there are other orthographic markers in English that imply a certain sound or otherwise. It makes me think that Standard English is supposed to be pronounced a certain way, and that this pronunciation isn’t necessarily the same as a regional dialect, like Hiberno-English. 

Thus, I think it would benefit all English speakers to learn a Standard Dialect for all English speakers to use as a method of common tongue, and that the Regional Dialect would exist alongside it for use during informal situations. However, I must admit that I have thought this through little comparatively to actual linguists in the field. I also recognize that some phonological features are just hard for some dialects to mimic, like the /th/ phonemes in Hiberno-English, or an un-coalesced yod in American English, and that such differences could breed feelings of elitism. Although, I also believe through anecdote that no one dialect could pronounce English as it is actually written, so a Standard English Dialect could also equalize the playing field for speakers of other dialects.

What do you all think? I get this probably isn’t a popular position, so I understand I probably won’t get much or any agreement, but I think it’s an interesting idea, at the least.",1629126692,AyyyGreens,11,313,1844,124,18

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1629111620,AutoModerator,196,479,2762,98,17

linguistics,How feasible would teaching IPA (or some other phonetic transcription system) to people who have to say others' names be?,"I'm thinking of this because of my sister and I's high school graduation. The counselors said each students' name aloud as they went on-stage to get their diploma. The counselors had previously asked students how to pronounce their names the day before during the graduation rehearsal, and they still got several names wrong (including my sister's, which is a common English name, and the name of the salutatorian during my own graduation). 

I'm not saying they should be expected to pronounce non-English names with phonemes or phonotactic combinations that aren't present in English, I'm just saying they should do the best approximation (ie what the student is normally called during conversations in English). I'm proposing that they learn the basics of IPA, enough to transcribe names in their own English dialect. Some other transcription could be used if it's unambiguous. And this applies to anyone who has to read people who they don't know's names.

My question is, how feasible would it be to include this in some kind of training? Since I'm already familiar with IPA it doesn't seem that difficult to me, but I'm not aware of any studies on how hard it is for people to get acquainted with it.

linguistics,Is learning Italian first the best basis for Moving onto other Romance Languages? Also is Italian (or the various languages of Italy) the closest of the modern Romance family to Latin?,"I was told by a few multilingual language that Italian gives a basic middle ground between all the romance language in that for example while a Spaniard will understand a lot of Portuguese easily without any prior study,  he'd have a much harder time with French and won't understand most Romanian basics.

Italian on the otherhand not only has a lot of similar pronunciation to Spanish in addition to word but also shares a lot in common with French structure and in addition was deemed on a quick google to be the closest language to Romanian of the Romance family. And its a big help plenty and plenty of other romance languages such as Sicilian are within the modern Italian borders and islands nearby Italy as well as also in regions cross Spain like Catalan and various islands and port locations in the Mediterranean that were major trading hubs dominated by Italian merchants in the Medieval Ages.

So plenty of people tell me Italian is the best starting point as a result of being in the absolute center ground if you plan to specialize in romance languages. And its a big help that Italy is the capital of Catholicism and most cultures with Romance tongues are primarily Catholic and that Italy is one of the economic superpowers of modern times.

It is all for this reason I was also told that Italian is the closest to Latin of the existing Romance languages in their current form. So I was told specialize in Italian first if you intend to go deep into Ancient Roman studies because its the closest (and it does't help Italy is where the Roman Empire's heartland was so you'd have to learn it anyway if you start Latin language as a hobby).

linguistics,Can advanced literature be effectively translated into a language without an extensive literary tradition?,"For example, could one take ""Anna Karenina"" or ""One Hundred Years in Solitude"" (arbitrary examples) and translate it into Maori or Inuktitut and have the translation be effective? I've never studied linguistics as a formal discipline, which is why I'm making this post to get answers from people who actually know what they're talking about, but my personal hunch would be ""no"". Maori or Inuktitut are languages with rich oral traditions centered around storytelling, which is a distinctly different medium from literature, therefore I conjecture that they would be ill-equipped to handle translating something like the above examples. I think you could tell the events of the plot effectively in these languages, but they would be missing several finer details and nuances, as well as more complex and abstract idea, that actually make the book worth reading. I also think that some concepts might be hard to translate across cultures. For example, ""Don Quixote"" probably won't make a lot of sense to a collectivist culture because of its existential/individualistic themes. 

On the other hand, I know that the Bible has been translated into Inuktitut and Cherokee and several other North American indigenous languages, and translating the Bible is no easy feat to say the least. These shows that complex topics and abstractions can be translated effectively. Even then, I still feel like the Bible is different then the other works mentioned above. Even the Bible itself originally came from passed down oral storytelling that eventually became transcribed. But I'm no scholar on the matter and could easily be wrong. 

I also feel like I have to make a disclaimer: in light of stuff like cancel culture and increased sensitivity, the ""position"" (i.e uneducated guess) I've taken can easily invite sanctimonious accusations of westerncentrism and racism. First of all, the two books I listed are western because I am ignorant of literature outside the western world. You can easily substitute those books with something from India or Japan. Furthermore, there's nothing about the idea of ""it's hard to translate books into languages that don't have a history of writing books"" that is racist. One has to think of the social context of how these languages emerged. Additionally, I'm not concerned with arguments over aesthetics about what qualifies as ""high"" literature; rather, I only care about the practical matters and linguistic analysis of this topic. Regardless of subjective assertions about aesthetics, ""Anna Karenina"" is harder and more complicated to translate than ""Harry Potter"" is just the straight facts, and not really a matter of opinion.",1628851611,FlaccoPastorius,1,423,2657,106,14

linguistics,Making a comparison between Shannon information and syllables,"I'm conducting some research at University on the effects of Information Density and Dependency Length on complementiser omission (i.e, whether a person opts for *I think (that) you are nice*). 

In a very broad nutshell, both independent variables (information and dependency length) contend that the greater the value, the greater the probability of a person using the complementiser *that*. I've conducted a mixed-effects logistic regression procedure and have found some interesting statistical results. 

From a conceptual point of view though, I'm curious about how to go about making a comparison between syllables and information. For example, some of my results show that when the amount of syllables in the clause is 8 there is an 18% probability that a person will use the complementiser *that* in a complement clause. Similarly, when the information of the matrix verb in question is 3 (bits) there is an 18% chance of the complementiser being used. 

Whilst this is interesting, I'm struggling to find a way to discuss this at length as the units are so different.",1628693771,crowpup783,0,173,1077,61,8

You can also tell about an event that cannot occur anymore but its importance to the present is the only focus. For example, if you are going somewhere and there is only one possible place where you could've gotten a pen you say ""I took a pen from that place"" The focus is entirely in the present but past is used.

linguistics,Research on how taboo words like YHWH change (or don't) over time?,"Hi! Like anyone I was spending my Tuesday evening watching a debate between an Orthodox Jew and Messianic Jew on the divinity of the Jewish ""Oral Law"" in Hebrew with subtitles. Although not speaking any Hebrew, I do know a few basic words like brit, Elohim and Hashem. However, what I realized was that I had never heard a Jew say the name of God, YHWH, and I seemed to remember that it's this sort of thing that ""no one has ever heard a Jew say the name of God because it's too holy"". So it made me think: if a word is borderline taboo to speak, like the name of a deity, how is it passed on? Sure I get that a Jewish mother might whisper the name to the young son, but unless a word is used often, surely it will change over time? Especially in an oral tradition, but maybe (probably?) within a written one as well? Or? What about things like intonation, does where you put the emphasis change quicker than for other words? In Hebrew specifically, where the vowels are not written down, is there any certainty that YHWH is pronounced the few times it is today as it was just 200 years ago? 100 years ago? What is to say that it doesn't start with an A before the consonants, like AYHWH? Or that all vowels are O, so it's YOHOWOH? Etc.

During periods of time when one Romance language (Italian, for example) pronounced &lt;SC&gt; as /ʃ/ before front vowels but another Romance language (Piedmontese, for example) did not, how would the second language transcribe the first's sound?

linguistics,What are some features that are common in your dialect of English that differ from Standard English?,"I’ll go first. I’m from the South with a big Southern family, and many people know about things like “y’all” and the pen-pin merger. However, one feature of Southern American English that I rarely see commented on is our use of the word “yonder.”

In Southern talk, we have “here,” “there,” and “yonder.” Yonder is used to mean objects or places in the far distance, like over a hill or cross a field. Then we can increase the range even further by using the phrase “way over yonder,” meaning far off past where we can see; past the horizon, even. 

Unlike its archaic use, though, I haven’t heard “yonder” or “yon” used as adjectives used in everyday speech, like “what light through yonder window break?” Instead, people use “that”, “those”, or a possessive adjective in conjunction with the adjectival phrase “over yonder,” which is used exclusively after the verb exclusively. Such I have often heard include sayings like 

“Hand me that book over yonder,” 

“What are those shadows over yonder?”

“Would you please pass me my keys over yonder?”

While being a common word in Southern talk, it’s not often portrayed in pop culture and standard English, at least from what I can tell. Most recently, I saw this word used in The Green Knight since it is an artifact of older English. Before that in title of the Disney show Wander over Yonder, where the titular character Wander voiced by Jack McBrayer has a southern accent himself.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1628506816,AutoModerator,207,479,2762,98,17

linguistics,I propose a name change for the collective group of supplements and minerals.,"Vitamins, as we all know and love, is a catch all term for supplements and minerals that are *vital* to staying healthy. The etymology of vitamin is as follows:

&gt;vita (latin for life) + amine

The reasoning for this is actually very interesting. Originally, scientists believed that vitamins contained amino acids, which if you’re unaware, are the basic building blocks for proteins, and well, life. This eventually turned out to be false when we learned that not all of these necessary nutrients were amino acids, however, the name stuck. 

Therefore, I propose a new name to replace “vitamin”. 

It is: vitamin

I know, it’s spelled and pronounced the exact same way, however, it is not the same word. 

New vitamin was coined from a more fitting definition of vitamins:

&gt;vital + minerals

It is exactly what our beloved vitamins are, vital minerals. This change is exactly what the English language needs in order to become more sensible to non native speakers. Another positive is the fact that we wouldn’t even have to change the word in any sort of prints or media, we’d only have to change the wikipedia etymology section of vitamin. This could very well kick off the spelling reform that modern English so desperately needs. Thank you for reading &lt;3",1628462054,MrsPhilHarding1964,5,213,1268,77,13

Where should I look if I'm interested in how language as a tool for sharing the internal states (thoughts, feelings, perceptions, etc.) and how the growing complexity of language through time interacts with said internal states?

For context, the idea that if there are no words for something, then that thing can't exist is strictly wrong, the world exist whether we have words for the things in it or not, but what about abstract ideas? How our ability to express them change our understanding and knowledge of that idea? For there are abstract entities that we experience that we have no words for them; we have ineffable, which is a catch-word for everything that we don't have a word for, or we try to express it through comparisons and made-up words (that also rely on comparisons).

Is it that the more you go back, the more primitive/basic (I can't think of a better word right now) the inner world of the 'people' would be, if so, how the ability of language to share complex ideas, through structure and vocabulary, impact and hinders/helps the growing complexity of the inner world?

③ How did we (i.e. moderns) figure out the Śākala Saṃhitā showed these innovations to begin with ?

linguistics,Are there any languages with politeness levels that vary not only lexically or morphologically but also syntactically?,"It is widely known that the T-V distinction is employed by many Indo-European languages as a system of honorific speech through the usage of different pronouns. 

Languages outside this language family, such as Japanese and Korean, attach different morphemes or make use of different conjugation patterns as well as through meticulous choice of words to denote distinct levels of speech, and this isn't even touching on the astonishing ways how many Australian languages have a register of 'avoidance speech' in the presence of a specific relative, constraining a speaker's vocabulary by doing so.

Languages in Southeast Asia such as Javanese even have entire different sets of vocabulary (three, in the case of Javanese) depending on who the speaker is talking towards, resulting the separate registers to be almost mutually unintelligible with each other.

However, from what I know of, I have yet to seen any language that demonstrates different levels of politeness/honorifics through syntactic variation (contrasting styles of word order, unique patterns of forming clauses, etc.), although I do admit that I have yet to be exposed to even the most basic literature on the topic of 'politeness', but I'm just wondering if it is theoretically possible for it to happen or not and whether this phenomenon has already been demonstrated in specific languages which linguists have researched on so far?",1628166891,PortalandPortal2Rock,36,221,1403,118,17

linguistics,"Is it possible for scholars to know a language enough to translate spoken word to written word, but not enough to translate the spoken word?","For context: in Brandon Sanderson's ""Stormlight Archives"" series, one of the characters ends up speaking an ancient, lost language called dawnchat due to magical reasons. When he does so, he knows what he is trying to say in his native language, so his wife ends up using that information to translate the written works they have that written in dawnchant. Clearly, to do this, she must be able to phonetically translate words spoken in dawnchant to their written form. Considering this language is so old (well over 5,000 years old when it was last used), it seems unrealistic to me that she would be able to accurately figure out what words are being spoken, since it would seem likely to me that the script would have changed drastically, and if they knew it well enough to know how to phonetically translate the script, they would probably be close to translating the language as a whole?

linguistics,Translating as a job.,"Hi!

Lately I’ve been researching a lot about translation as a professional carreer. I’ve been very indecisive about the subject, specially since whenever I ask the question: “Should I pursue translation as a job?”, there seems to be very contradictory opinions.

I’ve heard people say they are really well paid, others the opposit. Some have told me that I won’t go far if I only know two languages, mostly because I’m Portuguese, and the only other language that I can safely say that I’m fairly fluent at is English (I hope…). Moreover, some even suggest that in 10 years translating will be a dying job.

I’m split and I don’t know what to think. Today I asked some people in r/portugal what they thought about it, since I wanted to know the perspective from some people in my own country, and let’s just say that the replies were demotivating at best.

The only reason why I even considered this job is because I’m currently studying sciences at highschool. However, since last year I’ve been questioning if I like these subjects enough to find a job related to them. It’s not that I dislike them, I just don’t know if they’re what I want.

Translating was suggested to me by one of my parents acquaintances, at the beginning I didn’t put much thought to the idea. Nonetheless, once I thought more thoroughly about it, it started to become more and more appealing. This happened because I know that I love learning new languages, I don’t particularly like to study the intricacies of the language grammar and vocabulary, but I definitely enjoy to learn them.

In 1 or 2 years I think it’s fairly safe to say that I’ll have achieved proficiency level at English. I was just wondering if I could potentially put one of the only subjects that I excel at to good use.

If some people could give me some advice I’d really appreciate. Thank you very much to those who bothered to read all I had to say.

&gt;The [Divergent Association Task](https://www.datcreativity.com/) is a quick measure of verbal creativity and *divergent thinking*, the ability to generate diverse solutions to open-ended problems. The task involves thinking of 10 words that are as different from each other as possible. For example, the words *cat* and *dog* are similar, but the words *cat* and *book* are not. People who are more creative tend to generate words that have greater distances between them. These distances are inferred by examining how often the words are used together in similar contexts. Still, this task measures only a sliver of the complex process of creativity. See the [frequently asked questions](https://www.datcreativity.com/faq) for more details.  
&gt;  
&gt;We have validated this task on around 9,000 participants from 98 countries across the world. People who score higher on the task tend to be able to:

Proposal A connects 7 families and 3 isolates, which are located in 6 different non-neighbouring regions, spread across 2 neighbouring continents.

In contrast, there are numerous possible cognates between the languages, and some grammatical and phonological similarities too.

Proposal B also connects 7 families and 3 isolates, located in 6 regions (of which 4 are neighbouring each other), spread across 2 neighbouring continents connected by land and sea. Almost all of the populations who speak these languages share a common origin, with archeological and genetic evidence in favour of a connection between them.

linguistics,Why do some languages utilize words with multiple meanings for “love”?,"In English to tell someone they are loved intimately, family or romantically, we have a fairly unique word “love”.

linguistics,What sort of file format should I publish my cross-language dataset in?,"I have put together a database of 161 nouns across 1471 languages. I put this together because I'm wanting to show that my morphology algorithm does a good job of turning singulars into plurals across a wide variety of different languages.

But I think it might be useful to other people, so I'm wondering what format the linguistics community would find helpful.

It consists of:

* The 161 Koine Greek nouns (with their case and gender)
* Manual translations of those lemmas into English with notes
* For each of the 1471 languages, what my software and algorithms suggest is probably the correct translation, and a confidence score about how likely it is to be correct. (Not all languages have translations for all 161 words). Many languages have multiple documents I'm working with, and they don't always agree on the right way to translate a Greek noun.
* Information about the language, mostly extracted from Wikidata (e.g. countries that it is present in, sometimes some grammatical features, some information like that).

What would be useful?

* I can create a sqlite database, but I'm not sure how comfortable everyone is with writing SQL queries to get the data out.
* I can create a spreadsheet for each language with all the information available as columns (so it will be very wide). Or I can create a spreadsheet for each language and document combination. If you would open it in Excel, I think this is the only option.
* I can create one giant spreadsheet that has the whole vocabulary in it in a single sheet, but as I have 5.7million items, this is too large to open in Excel. If you are using Python or R this wouldn't bother you.

What's the best-practice? What's useful? What would make you happiest?",1627969607,solresol,25,300,1722,71,12

linguistics,"Does Jeff Hawkins' 1,000 brain hypothesis solve a mystery in language?","To me, one of the great mysteries in human language is how people are able to hear a word that can have dozens of potential meanings, and effortlessly hear only those meanings that apply in a given sentence, ignoring all other potential meanings. This talent is impressive enough when parsing the difference between everyday expressions, like ""a game of chess"" versus ""the great game of politics."" I find it most impressive when people hear a word used in a wholly novel way, but still understand the relevant meanings. For example, if I write, ""A table of myst floated above the lake,"" you understand that the myst is flat but that it doesn't have table legs. The brain can't have a rule that explicitly states, ""tables have legs except when made of myst,"" since the reader's brain has never seen ""table"" applied to ""myst"" before. I wrote my poli sci undergrad thesis on this subject years ago (as it applies to ""nation"") so have long wondered.

In Jeff Hawkins' book, A Thousand Brains, he offers a model for how the neocortex recognizes objects, and it seems like a great fit for explaining how we parse meaning in this way. I will try to explain the concept briefly.

The neocortex has roughly 150,000 ""columns"": groups of neurones arranged vertically. Cortical columns have roughly the same architecture everywhere in the cortex, so it seems like the whole cortex functions by the same underling logic. 

He proposes that each column models objects (and everything else), with each focusing on different aspects. So, when you feel a mug with your hand and recognize that it's a mug, one column focuses on its texture, another focuses on its shape, and so on. He argues that when we touch a mug, the sensory input is distributed to all relevant columns, and those columns send signals for every potential object that would match that sensory input: maybe it's a computer mouse, or a porcelain doll, etc. However, signals only get amplified if all the columns agree that the sensory input matches a given object. So, if its shape matches a computer mouse but its texture does not, the computer-mouse signal is dampened. The only interpretation that remains is the one that matches every column's input. The brain therefore eliminates thousands of potential wrong interpretations through a horizontal kind of voting, and comes up with the right interpretation with amazing speed. 

This gets pretty interesting when applied to words. When I write, ""A table of myst floated above the lake,"" various columns highlight the potential meanings of ""table"" and ""myst."" Some columns (or maybe parts of columns) may send a signal for ""table legs,"" but the columns that model ""myst"" do not match ""legs"" and so the ""leg"" signals get dampened. Only the meanings that match both ""table"" and ""myst"" survive the process, and we effortlessly understand the relevant meanings.

His theory has a long ways to go. But if something like this is true, it sure would offer insight on how humans parse words — with all their dozens of potential connotations and family resemblances — into obvious meaning, even when the words are used in entirely novel ways. It would provide a much clearer model for how this works than tortuous rules-based explanations or vague statistical notions.  It would be awesome if a linguist could collaborate with his research institute to hone the idea.",1627926558,Tristan_Cleveland,52,567,3362,70,11

linguistics,I tried making the current spelling of English regular,"I like playing around with the English language, trying to fix one of the major problems it has: the completely irregular spelling. I did this a few times, six in total, and the first five were based on the pronunciation of words (the General American in particular). This of course couldn't work, because in English you reduce unstressed vowels, so ""photo"" and ""photographer"" had different roots. Then yesterday I tried changing the current way of spelling English instead of making a new one, and I came up with an interesting system whose goal was to apply some existing rules to everything, remove other rules, make new ones and cover pretty much most of the English sounds. This is far from being perfect of course, but I think it's a nice start.

If you have any suggestions (as it doesn't include every single sound, as of now), write them in the comments.

Also, if I got something wrong, tell me.

Will it ever be adopted? No, probably not, it may be that some group of people will start writing this way, but I don't think it'll be ever approved officially.

Is using K for the hard sound and C for the soft sound a good idea? I guess so, maybe not if you think of the current C+A/O/U and C+E/I system based on the Romance languages system and you're not used to this one.

Will someone hate this attempt? For sure.

Here's the list of rules:

""L"" stands for ""letter""

""C"" stands for ""consonant""

""V"" stands for ""vowel""

The letter or group of letters after ""→"" indicates how to write the sound preceded by it. If it's part of an example (the ones between parentheses), it indicates the respelled word for the standard English word.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1627902020,AutoModerator,207,479,2762,98,17
linguistics,I need to make a word for a political phenomena,"Disaster comes to mind, but we'll get to that.

When a group of people revolts to have a government owned by the workers is called something like communism. When they start to plan the economy, it becomes socialism. When they install their chosen dictator they still call it socialism, but it's in fact an autocracy. With sufficient indentitarian violence we call it fascism.

That is a progression. I am making the claim that that is all the parts of one thing. What would you call it?  It seems to be sufficiently complex that it needs a name. The ideology tat spawns it might be called Marxism or Communism or Leninism, but the events (violent revolution, re-establishment of power, mass extermination of the unmentionables in the middle and lower class, transition to autocracy within months or weeks) happen enough that I feel like there needs to be a word for it or even just two.

Do we have something like that? Like... Proletariat Armageddon? It's not quite a cycle because it usually lasts a long time if the dictator stays alive, but it's a moment where stability is en mass sabotaged and then you wind up in a dictatorship via Communistic argumentation and military action.

She has never studied phonetics or linguistics but can immediately repeat words she’s never heard before perfectly. She can also explain where your tongue and lips should be and where the sound should be in your throat. She can tell what’s wrong with the position of your mouth when trying to pronounce certain words without even seeing you. This is with words and noises that don’t exist in the languages she speaks.

So I picked sentences from this blog called BienChabacano ([https://bienchabacano.blogspot.com/](https://bienchabacano.blogspot.com/)) that seemed like the ones you would say and hear in normal everyday conversations. I am curious to see how many of these sentences will be comprehensible to Spanish speakers. I put the English translations below.

Here it goes

1. Tan miss ya yo contigo. 

2. Ta ama yo contigo.

3. Ya harta gayod kame baňa na rio del bata kame.

4. Bien bonita si Maria.

I’ve been wanting a proper IPA keyboard for a long time now and I only recently thought about how it should be formatted.

My other thoughts were “I think the IPA keyboard would be better for linguistics if it were formatted relatively close to the IPA chart”, however I’ve also thought “there are many versions of the IPA chart, so that might not work at all. However there’s also another thing I thought.

“For non IPA readers who want to type with it and get used to it, it might be very confusing having /i/ and/or /p/ /b/ in the top left corner where Qq and Ww are for English speakers, but it might be less weird for Russians who have Йй in the top left.

linguistics,What Arabic speakers tell me about pharyngealised consonants and what Wikipedia tells me don’t match and I don’t understand why.,"Years ago, I was studying Arabic and the teacher was trying to explain what differentiated dāl and ḍād. His explanation, translated into technical terms, was that ḍād is an interdental consonant. This surprised me, because I had understood (from Wikipedia) that the phonologically relevant difference was that ḍād is pharyngealised.

Remembering this interaction, I had the opportunity today to ask an Egyptian coworker about Arabic phonology. And when I asked him to try to explain the difference in what the mouth is doing when pronouncing these sounds, he gave the same explanation as my erstwhile teacher. But he also said, when I presented my own pronunciation of ḍād (which is pharyngealised and alveolar) that my pronunciation was very good, and that I shouldn’t change anything about it, whatever it was that I was doing (I tried to explain pharyngealised consonants, he didn’t really seem to follow).

This isn’t an Egyptian thing. I don’t remember where my teacher was from but I remember he specifically denigrated Egyptian food as too garlicky, and related a story once of seeing a friend getting blown up by a car bomb (which the coworker says indicates Iraq or Syria).

So this leaves me a bit confused. I am inclined to believe that what Wikipedia indicates (that the phonologically relevant difference is pharyngealisation) is correct, but this seems to leave me in the odd position of claiming that at least some native Arabic speakers are wrong about how some of the sounds of their own language are pronounced.

The charade is that someone is “just saying” something devoid of purpose but what is being said is typically intended to provoke. The term is then the kind of mocking irony that was popularized in the 1990s, but it also speaks to today’s growing discomfort with direct conversations. 

The person “just saying” something finds it awkward to come out and say, “It is important to me that my feelings are considered when making decisions about where to eat.” So, they meekly conceal their feelings with “just saying.”

The term has been around for awhile but it has become more and more popular and is more often used by people who have less perceived power in a situation. Maybe its rise reflects a growing sense of powerlessness among young people, an aversion to conflict, and a love of ironic humor.

linguistics,"""Ass"" as a postpositive particle","I'd like to discuss a really interesting development in colloquial American English. I think this originated in AAVE and is still most prominent there. Maybe this construction has been around there for years and I just never picked up on it, but anecdotally it does seem to be popping up more frequently.  

So we're all familiar by now with ""ass"" being used as a postpositive intensifier of adjectives:

* *That was a* ***long-ass*** *movie.* 
* *I just heard a* ***loud-ass*** *bang outside.* 

Then there's a related usage I come across occasionally where the \[adjective + ass\] essentially creates a noun from the adjective : 

* ***Inconsiderate-ass*** *didn't even wish me a happy birthday.* (NOTE: this is not the same as ""inconsiderate ass,"" where ""ass"" is a noun instead of a postpositive particle. The stress sounds completely different. The speaker here isn't calling the other person an ass, they're simply calling them ""person or thing who is inconsiderate."" 

Now for the really interesting construction – could this have evolved from one of the previous two? The ""ass"" postpositive particle freely absorbs whole sentences to turn them into modifiers. Below is sourced from a screenshot of a text message conversation I saw online, edited slightly for presentability: 

* Person A: *You good bro? Just checking on you.* 
* Person B: *Oh shut up. Ole positive* ***let me check on a n\*\*\*a's well being-ass*** *n\*\*\*a. Get outta here.* 

I find the above incredibly interesting because from what I can tell, up until this was developed, English syntax had nothing like this (please correct me if I'm wrong). Having studied some Indo-Aryan languages for a bit, the development of ""ass"" is reminding me more and more of the *waalaa* particle found in Hindustani and Punjabi – a super versatile postpositive particle that often acts like a modifying adjective but can encompass whole phrases within its scope: 

* ਪਾਕਿਸਤਾਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਇਹ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਧ ਬੋਲੀ ਜਾਣ ਵਾਲੀ ਬੋਲੀ ਹੈ। 
* Pakistan-in 3.sg **all-from more speak.perfective go.infinitive \[waalaa\]** language is. 
* In Pakistan it is **the most-spoken** language. 

It could be interesting to see how this evolves, as it already seems pretty versatile. Any thoughts? Have any of you noticed this or any other cool usages of this particle or something similar?",1627543668,thirddegreebirds,64,376,2318,32,5

I'm curious: do you all think that Haspelmath made a convincing argument that the concept of ""markedness"" is a redundant and confusing notion that's better off being replaced? Do you think the terms that he provides as replacements for the various senses of ""markedness"" make sense, and are practical to use? Are there any other senses of the term ""markedness"" in linguistics you've seen used, which this article has missed?

linguistics,Question About River Names.,"So, this has been on my mind for a few days. I've been wondering how do rivers have only one name? I mean, most bigger rivers span entire continents, Danube, Ob, Rhine, etc... 

During the dawn of civilization, a massive number of people must have settled along these, thus each group calling it a different name, yet rivers which span more than one country/language/ethnic group are still called the same everywhere along them (with slight variations of course). How is this possible? How come Germanic people called the Danube, Danube yet Hungarians call it Danube as well even though it stretches across Europe?",1627511262,ilikenegativexp,10,103,614,27,4
linguistics,Etymology of sardinian pisittu and missittu?," I am very interested in these 2 words, I wish to know their etymology. How were they formed? Are they some onomatopoeias or they are simply derived from some vulgar latin words?

  The main reason why I question this is because my language (romanian) has the word pisica for cat and motan for male cat (which looks like the french word for it, matou). It is quite interesting that the latin word for cat is present in aromanian, a latin based language from the balkans (cat=catusha). Catusha is still found in romanian but with another meaning, handcuffs. 

  The most reasonable theory for me is that it comes from some turkish language, for many years the romanians were under the political influence of the cumans, pechenegs, bulgars and ottoman turks so it is reasonable to suppose that it comes from some turk word. In turkmen it is pisik. Other forms can be found in many indo-european languages.

The Igbo language for example, if you look on Wikipedia ( I understand it may be seen as an unreliable source), it lists the dialects of Igbo, and the names of the dialects are all names of villages in the area it is spoken. I thought, that must mean every village speaks a unique dialect of Igbo, therefore there is a separate dialect for every village, but that is not true apparently, as there are many more villages that do not appear to have their own dialects on Wikipedia.

linguistics,What exactly are the fixed stages of language learning according to SLA theory?,"Dear all, 

So according to Second Language Acquisition researchers, human beings learn languages according to fixed stages which are the same for everybody. E.g. I remember Bill VanPatten mentioning that the singular is ALWAYS learned before the plural [after minute 54 in this video https://youtu.be/vsX7ADtB2Pg ]. 

I recall Krashen making a similar case, i.e. that it is futile to ""learn"" and ""correct"" (consciously) say the instrumental case, when you haven't yet ""acquired"" it (subconsciously). And if you haven't acquired the instrumental case yet, this is only because your level of proficiency hasn't reached the stage where it's ready to incorporate said instrumental case within its subconscious map of the language. 

Long story short: there are certain fixed stages of language acquisition. My question is: What EXACTLY are these stages? 

When I look around on the internet, I find e.g. that babies start ""recognising words at 9 months"" or that they start ""babbling loose words"" at X months. But this is not what I should like to know. I want to know the EXACT stages of syntax/morphology/grammar that learners go through according to SLA-theory.

Also, there is a similar interaction that happens with these words and the prepositions “in” and “at.” When these prepositions are present, no article is required. Interestingly, it seems that the list of nouns above can be divided into three classes. One class can only be paired with “in”, one class can only be paired with “at”, and the final class can be paired with either.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1627297214,AutoModerator,242,479,2762,96,17

linguistics,"Why is the ""Canaanite shift"", or the shift of ""a"" to ""o"", more complete in Ashkenazi and Yemenite Hebrew than in Sephardi and modern Israeli Hebrew?","Comparing different variants of Hebrew, I have found an interesting aspect: 

Ashkenazi and Yemenite pronounce Qamatz Gadol with o, while Sephardi and modern Israeli Hebrew pronounce it with a. As the shift of a to o is a part of the ""Canaanite shift"", I wonder why was the ""Canaanite shift"" less prominent in Sephardi Hebrew(and by extension, Israeli Hebrew) than  in Ashkenazi and Yemenite Hebrew. Thus the greeting word would have been Sholom in Ashkenazi and Yemenite Hebrew but Shalom in Sephardi and Israeli Hebrew. 

We know that Sephardi Hebrew is based on the pronunciation of Hebrew by the Masoretes of Jerusalem and Yemenite Hebrew is based on the pronunciation by the Masoretes of Babylonia(while the Masoretes of Tiberias, whose Masoretes has become standard, would have pronounced Hebrew in a way that's different from all others). Did Arabic, which never underwent the Canaanite shift, influence Jerusalemite Hebrew pronunciation and its descendants(Sephardi, Iraqi, Israeli) more than Tiberian and Babylonian(and by extention Yemenite)?",1627283871,Geoffrey1016,5,161,1052,148,26
linguistics,Why has the simple past fallen into disuse in French but not Spanish?,"Hello all, 

I'm a student of Spanish who has just taken some French lessons. What's intriguing me right now is that both languages have two perfective past tenses, one simple and one compound. I've heard that the simple tense in French (*passé simple*) is virtually non-existent in spoken conversations. Whereas in Spanish, though the compound tense (*pretérito perfecto compuesto*) is more used (in Spain at least), the simple one (*pretérito perfecto simple*) is nowhere near disused or ""historic"". In fact, the latter is the preferred tense in Latin America. Does anybody know or have any interesting theories about this phenomenon?

linguistics,'Strong features are phonologically indigestible',"I posted this earlier in the Q&amp;A thread but got no replies, so I thought I'd bump it up here. My apologies if it's inappropriate for the main subreddit.

I'm working through Norbert Hornstein, Jairo Nuñes, and Kleanthes K Grohmann's *Understanding Minimalism* after having worked my way through a few G&amp;B textbooks, and I'm having a little trouble understanding what the phrase in the post title means. I've searched the Net, and only found the phrase in reference to this textbook. Hornstein, Nuñes, and Grohmann say:

&gt;*Strong features are phonologically indigestible* and so must be checked before the grammar splits; weak features, on the other hand, are phonologically acceptable and need only be checked by LF. (p 39, my italics)

I've only encountered the notion of feature strength in passing thus far, but digging into the literature I've been able to find, I think I get the basic idea. What I'm not following is the *causal* relationship ('…and so must be…') driven by some phonological aspect of the feature. As I understand it from other sources, elements with strong features need to get checked within a local configuration derivationally as soon as they appear, leading to movement before SPELLOUT; weak features do not demand immediate checking, so they can stay put in PF &amp; move covertly in LF, courtesy Procrastination. The other material I've been able to find on this seems to treat strength versus weakness as essentially arbitrary.

HNG seem to be saying that there's something phonologically unacceptable about strong features. I can't figure out what that means. How could phonology be at play in D-structure? What kind of rule might determine indigestibility? The metaphor is employed a few more times in the book, but not in a way that clarifies the matter for me. (It's also expanded: '…if strong features aren't checked before the grammar splits, the derivation will gag.')

Can anyone help me understand what's going on here? And if I'm getting some aspect of this wrong, please correct me!

Much thanks.",1627140960,Pathawi,5,335,2049,49,5

In an experiment, people are put in a social ""vacuum""/isolation. So they may be in a room by themselves. If everyone speaks their native language out loud for a *large* amount of time, will they all eventually speak in a lower state of pronounciation inherent to the language? 

This question is partly inspired by Orwell's notion that language simplifies into 'simple-speak'. However, simple speak largely has to do with interaction in society. Rather, I'm curious if languages break down to a predestined simpler form over time. 

For instance, a vowel sound 'ah', may reduce to grunting noises resembling 'hhehh'. I could argue that over time, people would resort to that grunting as a method which requires minimal effort while still resembling the speech. Or, perhaps the consonant 'p' eventually resembling 'b'. So in that example, people would pronounce 'pack' as 'behk', or 'backpack' as 'behkbehk"".

linguistics,Question about (Sorani) Kurdish phonology!,"Hello.

I'm writing a phonology paper but I'm kinda stuck because there's not much literature on Kuridish phonology.

So I'm asking for help here hoping there's any chance to get a help from a Kurdish expert or a native speaker.

My question is this: In the dialect of Kurdish with the dark ""l"", can the dark l follow a consonant in the middle of a word or morpheme? (e.g. /...C+ɫ.../)

I think this dark l is often romanized as barred l (ł) or double l (ll), and occurs in words like gʊɫ 'flower', which is distinguished from the clear l as in gʊl 'leprosy'(I referred to McCarus 1997, Kurdish phonology in ""Phonologies of Asia and Africa"")

I know that Kurdish has a maximal syllable structure of CVCC. But there's almost no information about the licit word-medial consonant clusters in this language. And I want to exclude cases where lax vowels get deleted as in the superlative suffix /-tɪrin/ is realized as \[-trin\].

Please let me know if there is any study that I can refer to.",1627019708,Numerous_Routine_472,0,176,987,42,5
linguistics,"I've used ""Imma"" as a substitute for ""I am going to"". Because a syntactician friend from university convinced me that English had no future tense, questions have spawned regarding this phenomenon.

Tbh, I'm working through some psychiatric stuff and this is mostly me addressing possible distractions by asking experts to evaluate my assumptions so I can either think about something else or focus more on relevant issues.

He was a mild schizophrenic that parsed grammar to drive away ominous, shadowy figures.  Such practices were satisficient (the word I asked him to verify from a different context.  This allowed him to open up with me). We ended up sharing a few pitchers and he opened my mind regarding how English, 25 years ago, worked.

There wasn't a future tense in English.  ""I will go to the store,"" I said.  ""It is my will that I go to the store,"" he responded.  ""I'm going to..."" I spluttered, quickly shutting up, paradigm shifted.

Fast forward a couple decades.  ""Imma"" emerges. The message is successfully transmitted using less energy:  the primary engine for linguistic development.  It has elided entire words without loss of meaning, further than ""I'm gonna"".

Is this an actual future-tense formation for English?  Are there other examples I should look out for?

linguistics,Has this vowel in Canadian English been studied?,"I haven't kept up with research in English phonology (or linguistics in general tbh) for the last 10 years or so, but when I was following the subject I never saw this vowel mentioned in any descriptions of Canadian English.

(Disclaimer: this is primarily based on my observation of my own speech, so it's not very scientific.)

Canadian English has a merger of the three historic vowels in the low-back corner of the quadrilateral, corresponding to RP  /ɒ/, /ɑː/, and /ɔː/ (lot, father, talk). The merged vowel is realized as \[ɒː\] or \[ɑː\] (rounding seems to be variable). But I've noticed in a few words, which seem to all be foreign borrowings written with &lt;a&gt;, there's a distinct vowel realized something like \[a:\]. It's backer and longer than /a/ (trap). (Canadian English, at least among younger urban speakers, has /a/  instead of /æ/, but that's a different sound change that I know has been described.)

Some words that have this vowel for me: drama, Mach, Bach, llama, macho, nacho. There's even a minimal pair: Mach vs. mock. (Note that words like 'father' or 'palm' with RP /ɑː/ *don't* have /aː/ for me.)

I recall first noticing this vowel when I read what I think was the title of a blog on punctuation called ""The Comma Sutra"" and it took me a second to realize that it was a joke on the ""Kama Sutra"", because the former has /ɒː/ for me whereas the latter has /aː/. Presumably the author was an American who uses /ɑː/ for both.

My hypothesis/guess is that this apparent /aː/ phoneme occurs in words that used to have /æ/ (before the sound change to /a/) in Canadian English, but /ɑː/ in American English, so that /aː/ resulted as a sort of compromise. Though a couple of counter-examples are 'pasta' and 'Mazda', which both have /a/ for me rather than /aː/, even though they have /ɑː/ in American English.

While grammars of the contemporary Mayan languages do usually cover syntax to a greater or lesser degree, I have noticed a paucity of information on the syntax of epigraphic Mayan. The main focus has always been on morphology, probably because it is very readily extracted from the inscriptions and codices. So far of books, papers, handouts etc. I've reviewed:

1. D. Law &amp; D. Stuart's chapter on Classical Mayan in *The Mayan Languages* (2017): only a handful of terse pages on syntax.
* D. Law's *A grammatical description of Early Classical Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions* (2006): one paragraph
* I. Calvin's *Maya hieroglyphics study guide* (2004): nothing
* J.K. Josserand &amp; N. Hopkins' *Workbook for a short course on Mayan hieroglyphic writing* (2011/2nd ed.): some scattered information, a total of maybe two pages' worth of text
* H. Kettunen &amp; C. Helmke's *Introduction to Maya Hieroglyphs* (2019/16th ed.): one paragraph
* S. Johnson's *Translating Maya Hieroglyphs* (2013): two pages
* А. Daveltshin &amp; A. Lacadena's *Grammar of Hieroglyphic Maya* (2013): very short, scattered snippets, not more than a page's worth on genuine syntax.
* M. J. Macri's *A descriptive grammar of Palenque Mayan* (1988): a solid 25 pages of syntax, but with a dialectological/comparative investigation of complementisers, and suffering from age somewhat.
* D. Mora-Martín's *The grammar, orthography, content, and social context of Late Preclassic Mayan portable texts* (2001): some 15 pages of text with a classification of independent clauses that appear on portable items.

Most of these are offhand remarks or short references to the elementary word order of an independent clause, and only #1 and #8 give a (however brief) overview of subordination/relativisation. Furthermore, only #1 talks about argument fronting, and even then very tersely.

Am I missing something? Is this really a field that has genuinely not been explored practically at all?

linguistics,What are the real voiceless consonant aspiration rules for English?,"A bit of background: I'm a non-native English speaker. I could say I understand English pretty comfortably and have been able to do so for a few years now. Buuut one aspect that I still need to work on is my pronunciation. I'm a native Spanish speaker, and trying to improve my English pronunciation is what got me into linguistics in the first place.

Anyway... I think somewhere along the way I unconsciously picked up the /t, p, k/ aspiration. But given that recently I've been working on other parts of my pronunciation (mainly the vowels), I decided to search for the ""proper"" rules for the aspiration of these consonants.

According to a large number of sources (I've seen it practically everywhere), they are as follows:

1. They are aspirated when at the beginning of a stressed syllable 
2. They are unaspirated when at the beginning of an unstressed syllable
3. They are unaspirated when at the end of a word
4. They are unaspirated when they come after /s/

So far so good, right? I noticed I do follow these rules. Pot = [pʰɒt], lucky = [lʌ.ki], stop = [stɒp].

But then I stumbled upon the word ""potato"". Such a simple and basic word, but it's giving me an accent crisis right now. 

Potato has three syllables right? /pə'teɪ.təʊ/. The middle one is the one that's stressed, so it's the only one that should be aspirated, right?

linguistics,Search engine over 370M YouTube subtitles (Automatic and Manual) in over 100 languages,"Hello,

I've built a website https://filmot.com which is a search engine over YouTube videos and subtitles and allows searching in more than a 100 languages. You can look up phrases, listen to pronunciation by different people and find videos with specific language subtitles. 

The basic functionality is to find videos where a specific word or phrase is said in the subtitles. For example:
https://filmot.com/search/tropicore/1
https://filmot.com/search/%22from%20russia%20with%20love%22/1?

You can also limit the result by channel country, category, view count, channel, publish date and other parameters.

If you wish to search automatic subtitles (this covers the languages: Russian, Spanish, Dutch,English,French,German,Indonesian,Italian,Japanese,Korean,Portuguese,Turkish,Vietnamese) click the ""Automatic Subtitles"" button, for other languages click ""Manual Subtitles"", this covers all the manually submitted subtitles (which may or may not correspond to the actual language of the video)

If the result is not in your intended language open the Filter Languages on the left and click your intended language/Channel country. (This is a design compromise otherwise you would have to select a language every time you search which might have been cumbersome).

It can be useful to understand colloquial usage when searching for particular phrases, expressions or pronunciation.

There are a few other options like searching videos that have subtitles in certain languages, for instance videos that have only English and Russian subtitles.
https://filmot.com/captionLanguageSearch?titleQuery=&amp;channelID=&amp;captionLanguages=en%20ru%20&amp;capLangExactMatch=1&amp;

If you click the flag the captions will display in different languages side by side for simultaneous translation. 

If you are a person who is triggered by flags you can turn flags off in the settings page. (I was banned from /r/Spanish for having the Spanish Flag represent the Spanish Language)

Feel free to suggest research ideas or reach out to me in regards to stuff that could be done on this corpus. I expect something useful could be done with this data and it would likely be useful for research.
I am also open to additional search/filtering requests that you may find useful.

Clarification on captions:
In YouTube there are two types of captions, automatic captions which are generated by YouTube with their speech to text system. (These are mostly correct but not always and some times don't even detect the language correctly or have poor quality due to poor sound or poor pronunciation) and manual subtitles submitted by the video owner (or before 2020 a volunteer contributor). The manual subtitles can be in the original audio language or in a different language. I don't have a sure way to determine if the manual subtitles match the audio language but I've implemented the ""manual"" search on my site with a heuristic approach, basically by default it only shows videos which only have 1 manual subtitle or has automatic subtitles in the language that matches the manual subtitles (and only that language is searched) In the hope that these manual subtitles match the audio. It works in most cases but not always, some times the video is in language A but the only subtitles are in language B. There are some ways to filter that data which can be used to remedy this, such as filtering by country.",1626808569,jopik1,39,512,3391,86,13

linguistics,"Similar words to ""Moist"" in other languages.","My question isn't quite technical so it may be a bit odd for this subreddit.

For those who are unaware, in the English language the word ""Moist"" has an odd effect on a number of the population for reasons entirely unknown. In addition to some people not being affected, it was shown that words like ""Hoist"" and ""Foist"" did not invoke the adverse reaction and that changing the context of the word to indicate moist as a positive trait (such as a moist cake) also did not change the way people felt about the word.

linguistics,How on Earth do you pronounce PIE for Tongue/Language: *dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s,"A similar question has been asked before on Reddit, but does not answer what I want properly.

How do you pronounce the Proto-Indo-European word for 'Language' or 'Tongue',  **\*dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s**. I wouldn't mind an IPA transcription or something, because, damn- the Proto-Indo-Europeanists are a real weird bunch of Linguistics. 

Apparently because they begun constructing PIE before the IPA had been made, they use a different system of transcripting PIE words. 

According to what I found, the second letter is not a voiceless n (alveolar nasal), despite having a voiceless diacritic- but in fact the diacritic used represents that the n is syllabic, even though... syllabic consonants use a... different diacritic? Idk, PIE Linguists are weird.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1626692419,AutoModerator,257,479,2762,96,17

linguistics,Smart writers should write words borrowed from Latin in their correct Latin forms,"Long time ago, Americans did a good thing by changing the spelling of *-our* to *-or* in words such as *colour*, *flavour*, etc. The reformed American spelling is more correct etymologically; it is the Latin spelling, whereas the *-our* spelling is the Old French spelling; and of course, the reformed American spelling is simpler and more economic. Every time you write *color* instead of *colour*, you save one byte of memory, or possibly more than one byte if you are using an encoding such as UTF-16.

Unfortunately, however, it seems that the spelling reform movement stopped there. English is still filled with Latin words that are misspelled under the influence of Old French.

In my opinion, spelling reform does not need to wait until some decree is issued by some authority somewhere. We currently live in the information age. It will only take you a few seconds to find out what an etymologically correct spelling should be. People writing on social media, blogs, etc. should try and spell Latin words in their etymologically correct forms.

One good place to start is to abandon the spelling *-ous* in favor of the more correct spellings *-us/-os*. For example, instead of writing *continuous*, *ambiguous*, *ridiculous*, etc., smart people should write *continuus*, *ambiguus*, *ridiculus*, etc. Instead of *religious, fabulous, poisonous*, etc., they should write *religios, fabulos, poisonos*, etc..

What can possibly happen if you use the correct Latin spellings? I don't think there will be any misunderstanding. People will know what you mean. Nobody should be able to criticize you for using a spelling that is more correct and more efficient.",1626639007,HD86000,1,267,1663,81,13

1. The individual acquired the language in early childhood and maintains the use of the language.
2. The individual has intuitive knowledge of the language.
3. The individual is able to produce fluent, spontaneous discourse.
4. The individual is communicatively competent in different social contexts.

linguistics,Question about accents/dialects on different regions in the United States.,"Hopefully these questions can be answered here, they are two totally different stories.


1.) I’m a Californian (born and raised) and I have a standard American accent. I just got back from a week trip from the Deep South, specifically Mississippi and Alabama, where I met one of my moms old friends from California. This lady was born and raised in California, she attended college in Alabama. Her accent is southern, not heavy, but definitely noticeably southern! I was shocked when my mom told me she went all throughout grade school and high school with this woman because she has a southern accent.


Is it possible to pickup an accent if you live in an area for so long? I might go to college in Alabama or Mississippi and end up living there afterwards, I cannot imagine myself with a southern accent. It was kinda trippy to hear her talk knowing she was born and raised in California.


2.) As stated, I’m a Californian. My parents were both born and raised in California, as were all my grandparents too. However, my dads parents have this weird accent/dialect (idk what the difference is) with the way they say certain words.

For example, the days of the week. My parents and I pronounce Monday as “Mun-day” however, my grandparents pronounce it as “Mun-dee”. Kinda weird, instead of “day” they pronounce it “dee”. This goes for all days of the week.

Another example is the word potato. My parents, I and most people would say “puh-tay-tow” however, my grandparent would pronounce it something like “puh-tay-tuh”. They use an “uh” instead of the “oh” sound.

My grandparents were born in 1940, not sure if that would have anything to do with it. My grandpas mother’s side of the family was from Kansas,Missouri,Indiana and moved to Bakersfield, Ca in the 1930s, they were part of the dust bowl migration. His fathers side was from California. My grandmas mother was from Colorado and her father was from Iowa, but was raised in California. This is something I’ve noticed with quite a few older people (75+) many seem to have an odd accent/dialect, they province certain words different.",1626553587,nobleinquiry,2,361,2098,74,10

linguistics,Computational Linguistics / NLP (career advice),"Hi everyone!   


I have a Bachelor's in English Language Teaching. The problem is I have a stutter, moderate-to-severe one, since my early childhood. This causes me to receive almost no positive response from most of the educational instititutions who interviewed me for teaching jobs in my country. I tried speech therapy twice with two different therapists. The benefits were only of the short-lasting type, unfortunately. Therefore,  I'm thinking of changing my sector. I didn't want to be a teacher at all from the beginning anyways. 

Currently, I'm doing an MA on psycholinguistics. I'm also thinking of doing a PhD, which means I have to start earning my own money after some point. So, here are my questions.

linguistics,"Why are l (L), n, m and r not vowels?","I've been getting into music and so I've been thinking a lot about sound and wondering what distinguishes each of the vowels from one another, and questioning why I can seem to put a vowel name on various bird calls from crows despite our different vocal structures. 

While doing so I've found there seems to be a useful core distinction between harmonic and non-harmonic sounds, with all of our harmonic sounds just having different overtones being resonated/dampened (which is how we distinguish between them) and non-harmonic sounds being quite distinct. This satisfied my questioning of why I wanted to describe bird calls with letters, but I feel like if anything, shouldn't being harmonic be what distinguishes vowels from consonants?

I've heard the controversy behind y/j, and maybe w, but why am I not hearing controversy behind l, r, n, and m to name a few? Are l and r really as distinct from o as o is from p? 

Also, if all we were taught is the language, without being meta-taught about the various letters from a young age, would we really still think that w was a consonant?

Hello everyone! My name is Lizzy Naughton, and I am a linguistics student at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, and I'm looking for participants for my study about international gaming culture.

The study will be about how people learn new languages and skills because of their investment into MMO/MMORPG culture. Virtual reality, role play scenarios, immersive storylines, and interaction within the game and outside of the game all all factors that make the MMORPG community ideal for learning complex skills, particularly communicative language skills. My study will aim to be an **ethnographic investigation** into online gamer culture, specifically for those who are gamers who are non-native English speakers playing in a primarily English-speaking environment.

My background is of someone who loves studying linguistics, and who also loves observing how online culture and what gaming culture is changing younger generations.

All I will need is to conduct some personal interviews within the span of 4-5 months, and permission to observe your chat interactions in communicative platforms such as discord, reddit, etc. (This platform will depend on the participant.) The interviews will last no longer than an hour, and I will only need up to three interviews. **All names/ personal information will be kept anonymous.**

I am specifically looking for participants who are 19-years-old and older, who play an MMORPG regularly, and who do not speak English as a native language. English proficiencies do not have to meet a certain standard, but you have to interact in-game or online in *mostly* English.

The study will begin within August. The end goal is to have a **collection of opinions and experiences from non-native English speakers about their experiences as gamers**. What do you like about the community? How do you feel about your English? **We also want to have linguistic observations about how players communicate and chat in discussion-based forums,** looking for signs of code-switching, use of multiple kinds of English dialects, etc.

Please, help me out and reach out!! This will be an interesting and worthwhile experience. The study will help future researchers to understand the nature of MMORPGs and the MMORPG community in the context of globalization, internet culture, and youth culture.

linguistics,Does it means no one can speak any language like their native?,"When I spend a lot of time reading, sometimes i get lazier and I continue reading by selecting the important sentences and translating them on google translate addon. But there is something that confuses me about this.

Lets think of two phrases, both are correct and understandable in terms of grammar rules. First one is written by a fluent speaker and the other one is written by native speaker. Google translate mostly translates the native one correct(at least, semantically) but google translate mostly translates the fluent person's semantically wrong, and sometimes google translate even translates the phrase to the exact opposite meaning.

linguistics,Antivocative articles,"I was reading--as one does--about Westrobothnian on Wikipedia, the Swedish variety spoken in the province of Västerbotten and that includes this small section:

&gt;The pleonastic article is widespread among languages in the area, as far north as Troms. A pleonastic article, marking the opposite of the vocative, is put before people's names, pets' names, and words denoting the immediate family. The masculine form is n, and the feminine form is a. For example; “father is home” is n far jär hæ̀im’. In dative, n becomes om or o, e.g. ɒt om Jɒ̀nk’ “to John”.

I'm not sure why it's called 'pleonastic'. The word itself links to the article *Dummy pronouns*, but this seems like a separate phenomenon to me. Firstly because it's an article and not a pronoun, and secondly because it doesn't seem to agree with the definition there at all: *""fulfills a syntactical requirement without providing a contextually explicit meaning of its referent.""* (It *doesn't* fulfil a syntactical requirement, and *does* provide contextual meaning. Right?)

So, I feel like calling this usage the 'antivocative' (case?). And thinking about it there seems to be a parallel usage in many types of German (though not necessarily always Standard German), like this:

    Dieter (Vocative)
    Der Dieter (Nominative, antivocative)
    Des Dieters (Genitive, antivocative)
    Dem Dieter (Dative, antivocative)
    Den Dieter (Accusative, antivocative)

In these varieties you wouldn't use an article when speaking to the person (i.e. vocative), but it's more or less obligatory to do so when speaking *about* them. I think that also, in most(?) German varieties that have this usage, the use of the article is more frequent with referents that are more well-known to the speaker (and listener), but I'm not entirely sure of that.

Does that seem right? That the German article before a personal name (or sometimes also kinship terms: e.g. 'Der Papa ist schon daheim') has an 'antivocative' meaning? It's often described as 'redundant'; just as the Westrobothnian article had it as 'pleonastic' (i.e. basically 'redundant' as well). But that characterisation therefore seems wrong to me. 

Of course in some or even most phrasing the usage may still be technically redudant, i.e. when the person isn't present, the fact that it is the most frequent with familiar people, either their names or kinships terms, seems like this could usefully distinguish between speaking *to* or *about* a person.

It seems somewhat extraordinary then, that that would make the vocative the least-marked case, but perhaps it isn't.

linguistics,Survey: which type of multiplication tables did you memorize as a child? (Trust me this is relevant to r/linguistics),"In most of the English speaking world, I've come across two variants of multiplication tables -  
One that accounts for ""phrases"" that have already appeared in a lower table and the other that does not.  
One example, say, you're learning the table of 3. You go 3-1s-are-3... 3-4s-are-12, and so on. When you get to the table of 4, you can have created fresh new phrases like 4-1s-are-4... 4-3s-are-12. Or, you can have reused phrases that you have already memorized before. (let's call this type A)  
  
For the latter, say, with 4's table you repeat things like 2-4s-are-8, 3-4s-are-12 (which are from 2's and 3's tables, respectively) and only after that you start creating new phrases. (let's call this type B)  
  
Please comment with the type that you have learned. More details below (if you're interested).  
  
The latter is much more efficient in terms having to rote-memorize new stuff, and has a better ""random lookup time"", as we computer scientists call it. I'm trying to research better methods of teaching young children in a variety of subjects.

That all made me wonder, is there any consistent semantic content to zero-derivations at all, or could - if we knew nothing about English or English-speaking cultures - ""to boat"" have any verbal meaning that might be associated with boats?

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1626087615,AutoModerator,250,479,2762,96,17
linguistics,Ethnic Generic Singular Names (contains racist content),"This post is about the use of ethnic terms as generic singulars. I've cited some racist content. I don't want to offend anyone: The content is motivated by the nature of the linguistic usage that I'm asking about.

Recent events have brought Gil Scott-Heron's classic poem '[Whitey on the Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goh2x_G0ct4)' to mind, &amp; that in turn got me thinking about a phenomenon in English I've wondered about a couple times over the past few years: Intuitively it seems to me that there are a couple of related ways in which English-speakers use ethnic singular terms to refer to something other than individuals:

* In some instances, the singular is used generically to talk about characteristics attributed to all members of the group—eg Raphael Patai's book *The Arab Mind*, or almost any ethnography before the '60s (grabbing the readiest example, '…all the necessities of life are within easy reach of the Trobriand Islander'—Malinowski). This usage tends to be racist, but it also sometimes occurs from people *within* a group: Malcolm X in a 1962 interview with Robert Penn Warren: '…the implication is that the Negro is something distinct or different and therefore needs to learn how to improve himself'. This needn't be ethnic, I suppose: *Time* in 1966 ran an editorial essay on 'The Homosexual in America'.
* In some instances, a generic individual is made to stand in for the population as a whole. Here, I'm thinking of 'the Hun' to refer to Germans during the First World War, or 'the Boer' in 'Kill the Boer', or 'Fuzzy-Wuzzy' in Rudyard Kipling's poem.

I think these bleed into each other, but the core difference I'm getting at is reference to individuals (perhaps all of them) in a group versus referring to a group as an unindividuated whole. When Saint Nihal Singh writes: 'The hide of the Hindoo varies from the dull, pale, sallow-brown of a Mexican to the extreme black of an African.', he is clearly making reference to a variety of individuals despite the singular noun. When Evans-Pritchard writes 'And if the Nuer has no law, likewise he lacks government.', he *can't* be referring to individuals—even generic ones. It is the Nuer as a whole who have or do not have government. The poetaster who writes 'The Jap is at thy gate, England' is well aware that the overwhelming majority of Japanese people are on their home islands, with no intention of leaving. Gil Scott-Heron knows that only a tiny fraction of white people were accepted to the Apollo 11 Mission.

Are there terms for these usages? I haven't been able to find anything by Googling, tho I think it's likely that that's because I haven't been able to think up the right search terms. Is there any literature on this?",1626081524,Pathawi,11,461,2734,55,7

The double dot vowels are especially tricky for me to pronounce and in combination with the consonant shifts(W -&gt; V for example), it makes it even harder for me to speak German. 

But, if I can understand German speech, I can deduce the word’s meaning while reading German,  and I know the consonant shifts that occur, then why is it that I can’t speak German myself and I am stuck as a receptive bilingual of German?

TL;DR: Mainstream theories of syntax make a bizarre prediction: that under certain circumstances, language learners should be able to acquire syntactic structures they've never been exposed to. We designed 3 artificial languages with the properties thought to facilitate this type of acquisition-without-exposure, taught these to participants, and then tested the participants on the structure they hadn't been exposed to. In 4 experiments, learners spontaneously produced the unexposed structure. (For the linguistically savvy: we trained people on different combinations of relative clause types, e.g., subject &amp; indirect object relative clauses, and then tested them on other types, e.g., direct object RCs. Theories with operations like ""movement"" (GB/minimalism) or ""slash categories"" (HPSG) hold that knowledge of 1 RC type amounts to knowledge of all, and therefore predict that people should be able to produce structures they've never heard.) The finding supports the idea of an extra level of abstraction above ""tree structures,"" and is evidence against surface-oriented theories like those espoused by usage-based theories of language acquisition.

linguistics,Curious about the conventions for the Anglicization of foreign proper nouns?,"This question occurred to me when I (Canadian) had a conversation with a friend about a European history podcast I was listening to. The city of Budapest doesn't come up very often in my day-to-day activity, so I pronounced it ""Budapesht"" like the podcaster, not really thinking about how other westerners say it (i.e. Budapest, with the sh). Obviously, my friend laughed at me and said I sounded pretentious.  


This got me to thinking about other proper nouns. English speakers say ""Paris,"" and are often considered by others to sound pretentious when they say ""Pa&lt;r&gt;ee."" But with less common places, I would feel ""boorish and uncivilized"" if I pronounced it as ""the Treaty of Troyes"" instead of ""the Treaty of Twuh.""  


Is it simply the case that more culturally significant places get anglicized by exposure? Or is there some other factor affecting it, such as the language of origin?",1626020880,TheMcCleaver,13,149,896,76,11

linguistics,Should the “speech” used by Sardinian shepherds be considered something of its own?,"I tried asking the same thing in ask linguistics but I didn’t get any answers.

A great introduction to the topic: https://www.google.it/amp/s/www.lanuovasardegna.it/regione/2013/01/16/news/notte-dei-fuochi-i-pastori-parlano-con-gli-animali-1.6359821/amp/ (it’s Italian, there’s no English document regarding this).

Growing up I always heard (and still hear) my grandma call animals (as in calling them to come or to call them to get their attention) in a different way from the name she gives them when talking about them to humans (and the terms weren’t interchangeable, for example: “cat” is /muç/ when called, but /‘gat.tu/ when talked about or in general).
To me that was usual and I didn’t think much about it, even to my mum they were only sounds with no meaning, this until I got interested in linguistics and I started to think about the fact that these sounds were used on specific occasions to define a certain animal rather than another, if you used /muç/ when calling a dog it would be wrong, which is similar the definition of “word”.
Some of its characteristics that differ from Sardinian (and that can also be seen in the article) are:

-one verb time (present) and one mood (imperative) e.g. “pru!” “tru!” (As said in the video) or “tzéule!” (word used in my dialect to tell an animal to shut up, it doesn’t have a infinitive form or a present one, so it’s most likely a word that was also borrowed in normal dialect) vs. Sardinian that has many verbs moods and times

-no marked plural vs. -os/-as in Sardinia

-reduction of words e.g. ervé for erveghe 

-the vocabulary isn’t necessarily related to the Sardinian counterpart, I’m gonna compare 5 words and one verb in the shepherd speech of my dialect and in my dialect:

•muç/ˈmu.çi/mu.çit.ˈteɖ.ɖu-gattu-cat

•ˈti.ka-pudda-hen

•Wɪ/tε/dε (unsure about all of them)-cane/catzeddu-dog

•ʧɔ-porcu/erre,sughe-pig

•tʰɘ̞/tε-erveke-sheep.

•ˈtseule-ista muttu/ muttu- (you) shut up!

Note: the words and the amount of difference between them and true dialect depends from place to place.

So after looking at this I’m here to ask, should it be considered as something on his own, and if yes, as what (dialect, cryptolect, pidgin...)?

Ps. Sorry for the bad ipa + sorry if the way it’s written really confusing, I don’t know how to change that to make it more organized.",1626010246,Rmnclnggs,7,374,2334,83,13

The romanian dictionary of etymology identifies the word as having slavic origins, which is plausible but still rather difficult to determine, due to geopolitic limitations of the regions of Romania in the middle ages.

linguistics,Is profound → profundity actually trisyllabic laxing or is it just another double borrowing?,"Wikipedia lists profound's noun form, profundity, replacing the vowel aʊ with ʌ as an example of laxing of the sound, but I'm curious if it actually turned into profundity due to this linguistic process or was it simply due to a difference in French and Latin spellings &amp; pronunciations. What I mean by that is, the spelling for the verb comes from French and the spelling for the noun comes from Latin (there are other examples for this such as enjoin → injunction and possibly pronounce → pronunciation, for which the same question as profundity could be posed).

Etymonline suggests a spelling with ""ou"" never occurred in French, but regardless of whether it did or not, it could have caused the ou/u discrepancy as well as the oin/unct (also found in point/punct). But it also suggests the words originated from French separately, with profound joining the English language with the primary meaning of  ""characterized by intellectual depth, very learned"" whereas profundity was first attested in early 15th century with the meaning ""bottom of the sea"".

The Sardinian language didn't have cases, neither do most of the modern Latin languages. Romans would have manipulated their origin to fake a blood ancestry with Greeks. Also, there would have been a Sardinian history that lasted 4000 years before Roman history, there were some documents in Sardinian, and even Rome and Athens would have been founded by the Sards.

I was on the Santa Monica pier, in the thick of the vendors and the like.  There was a woman who was a ""barker"", trying get get people to spin a giant wheel to win a trip for a vacation.  Her ""bark"" was ""get THAT free spin.  Come on over and get THAT free spin"".  Not get ""your free spin"", or ""a free spin"", but ""THAT free spin.""  The usage of ""that"" in this context, has a very informal tone to it.  As if the masses are assumed to be in tune with a ""spin"" being a common enough concept, to deem using ""that"" to describe the spin.  

Another example was when I was on a flight and the stewardess told us to ""check THAT seatbelt"".  Not ""check your seatbelt"".  Again, the usage of ""that"" in this context is in this very informal manner and said in a way, where there's almost an unspoken rule that it's understood that if a person is using ""that"" this way, then there a consensus to converse with the person in an informal manner likewise.

&amp;#x200B;

""never had  Greek (a name that placed Romans), there are ""ellin = illin = illir""; -''illin= illir'' but is with the albanian north dialekt(tribe Dor = gegeni); -Greek language is Albanian (= illire) language with conjunction of words, a phenomenon that occurred at the time of writing (7-3 BC) when the language was written for the first time. What previously was said in a sentence at the time of writing was introduced in a single word.  A few from the latin(roman), greek and russian etymological dictionary(=Pak nga fialori etimologjik mbi greqishten, romaken dhe rusishten). You will see elements of word formation and will understand that is Albanian language(= Illyrian language) that participates in the building of the words of ancient Greek and Latin(Roman). The issue which we have dealt is word formation. Until today, the word is treated as a unity of phonemes or syllables with a certain emphasis. In fact it is not so. The word is a whole sentence with small Albanian(=illire) words that explaining its own word, and that sentence was superimposed in a single word at the time of writing of language (centuries 7-3 BC when is done the writing of the language). So what had been said before in a whole sentence at the time when the language was written is introduced in a single word, and then the Greek and the Roman(latin) were distinguished from illir(= Albanian) language. So albanian is the language that has created other languages, by merging the Albanian(= illire) short words from a whole sentence by summing them into a single word. like:: kallos(=i mire = good) = k - all(ill) - os = k(q) - yll - os = that - star - is = is star, is very good like a star. We and today say: he is yll(star), is very good. With greek it will be: pu - asteri - ine; -but is in albanian language: k(q) - yll - os = q - yll - esh.  example from latin language: gloria(=lavdi = glory) = g(= q) - lo - ri - a = q - la - ry - a = that - ap - enter - is = ryn la, ngrihet la, mburret, i thuret lavdi(=rise ap, enter ap(to the sun), glorify; -with himself latin(roman) language would be: ''qui - sopra - intra - e'';  -as you see, complies is only with Albanian language(=illirian language)  ''g(q) - la - ry - a''. or: example from ancient Greek: ''dramatopios(= ai qe ben drama = he who made drama) = drama - to - pi - os = drama - te - be - esh = drama - to - do - is''. -with Greek language is: ''drama - na - kani - ine '', as you see, complies is only with Albanian language.  As I told you at the entrance, linguistic elements that participate in the word formation from the ancient times are: All the base simple words have in their composition one name of the sun in ancient times, as ''ili, illi, eli, elli, oli, olli, ali, alli, uli, ulli, tili, tilli, teli, telli; dilli, dili, delli, deli; te, teu, teo, deo, die, dio; eri, ori, oni, ini; Asi, Ati; a, au; e, eu; i, iu = y, yu (star; sun); koku; -api, opi, ipi, epi, upi; siri, sari (zari, ziarri); -etc'' build these designations of the sun with all kinds of vowels. Or have one of the qualitis of the sun, like the heights, the distances, etc (designations that comes from itself quality of the sun). In ancient times for Egiptians and for the peoples that had related with Egipt:  ''Dilli(=Apolloni = zoti) = sun(= God)’’. Every base simple word has in compose one of denomination of the Sun in ancient times, or one of elements that are linked to the sun, and a base simple word take sense from the properties of the sun which explains the word that is in analysis.. Likewise, in the construction of the base simple words also participate ancient Albanian verbs 'i, in, ir, is (= hysh; ish); ri, rin, rir // e, en, er, es; re, ren, rer; -etc that are the same verbs but are made with the other vowels = hy, hyn, hyr; ry, ryn, ryr = enter', and from auxiliary verb ''e, es, et, est = is / i, is, it, ist = is; -etc verbs, built with all kinds of vowels, to increase diversity between the words, that the words to be distinguished each from the other. An important role in word-formation have played the nodes 'k; t', especially Albanian node ''k = q, që = that'' which is the base node that supersedes all the consonants when they are in the role of a node (all the consonants take the role of the node when they are in the beginning of a simple word). This node in many cases is associated with different vowels. These words that we said above are tha basic elements for forming of the base simple words, but there are lots of other words and verbs of Albanian language who participate in formation of consisting words. Because(as we said), every word is a whole sentence(is not a simple word). Each base simple word is made up of a whole sentence, and every simple word(in generaly) takes the meaning from a characteristic of the sun (as height, the distance, etc); -or every word has in composed one of virtues of the sun. Shembull(=example): eg: gloria(=lavdi = glory) = g(= q) - lo - ri - a = q - la - ry - a = that - ap - enter - is = ryn la, ngrihet la, mburret, i thuret lavdi(=rise ap, enter ap(to the sun), glorify; -with himself latin(roman) language would be: ''qui - sopra - intra - e'';  -as you see, complies is only with Albanian language(=illirian language)  ''g(q) - la - ry - a''. here ''la'' is a characteristic of the sun(=al, il = dill), and means 'la = al, ill, dill'  that goes up(on high), deep(below) and far (like enters and the  'al = il, dill = sun'), in ancient times it was thinking that was the Sun he that rolling around the Earth. or: candela(=candle, light = kandili, qiri qe ben drite) = k - an(=hyn) - dela(=dili) = q - hyn - dili = hyn dielli, hyn drita = that - enter - dela(=dili = sun) = enter ''sun'', enter the light; -with the roman(=latin) language will be ''qui - intra - sol'' but that is in albanian language ''c - an - dela(=dili) = q - an(=hyn) - dili = that - enters - sun''; -as everywhere complies is only with Albanian language.  or: ''centila(=shkendia = spark) = c - en(=hyn) - til - a = q - hyn - til(=diell) - a = hyn til(=dill, diell), hyn drit, ben drit(dill = diell) = that - enters - dill(=sun) - is = enters sun(=til=dill = diell), enters light, is doing light''; -as everywhere complies is only with Albanian language.  or: dolce, dulce(=ambelsin = sweet) = dol - c - e = dol(=dill=sun) - that - is = sun - that - is = is the sun, is like the sun, it is very good (like the ''sun = dol = dil, diell''). With latin language it will be ''sol - qui - e''; -complies is only with Albanian language.  Example from ancient Greek: ''dramatopios(= ai qe ben drama = he who made drama) = drama - to - pi - os = drama - te - be - esh = drama - to - do - is''. -with Greek language is: ''drama - na - kani - ine '', as you see, complies is only with Albanian language. -and this is for all the words of ancient Greek and Roman.   -or the greek and roman word: latria(=λατρεια(in greek)) = worship; adoration, when you boast someone, you raises him very high = lat - ri - a = lat - ry - a = up(on high) - enter - is = enter up(on high), you boast someone, you raises him veri high(= e ryn lat, e mburr shume, e ngre lat). With Greek language would be: ''latria = apano(= on high) - to benis(to sikonis = to enter) - ine(=is) = apano - to sikonis - ine = on high - to enter - is''; -the word comply only with Albanian ''lat - ri(ry) - a''.   or: kallos(=i mire = good) = k - all(ill) - os = k(q) - yll - os = that - star - is = is star, is very good like a star. We and today say: he is yll(star), is very good. With greek it will be: pu - asteri - ine; -but is in albanian language: k(q) - yll - os = q - yll - esh.  -or: the Russian words ''rodill, rodit = lind, del nga erresira ne diell ose ne dit'' = ry - dill/ ry - dit = enter - sun/ enter - day = enter to the sun, enter to the day, enter to the light = born, emerging from darkness into light''. With today's Russian language would be ''vhodit - na sollncie'', but it is in Albanian language ''ry - dill/ ry - dit(= enter - to the sun / enter - to the day)''.   Russians are Illirian branch that opened up in the Caucasus and in Urals circa 1100-1200 BC, where crucified mainly with Mongols of Siberia.  As you can see, it is precisely this language(= illyrian = albanian) that has helped to create the other languages.  Someone says that I do the game with the sounds to fit the meanings of the words of other languages with the Albanian(= illyrian) language; - but this does not happen with 10 or 100 words; -Albanian(= illyrian) language gives the meanings of all the words. Let them test everyone and give the meaning of those words with an other language, with the Greek or with the Roman(=latin) language. It is impossible, the meaning comes only with Albanian(= illyrian) language. I say Albanian(= illyrian) language, because are exactly the words of today's Albanian: the verbs 'i, in, ir(= hy, hyn, hyr) = enter' and 'ri, rin, rir(= ry, ryn, ryr) = enters', is the auxiliary verb 'e, es, et, t, s, est(=eshte) = is', are the names of illi(=star) and dilli(=sun) and the nodes ""k, t(= qe, te) = that"" constructed with all kinds of vowels that we finds them in the construction of the words of all the languages from the early period. We say ''Albanian(= illyrian)'' because all elements of construction of the Greek and Roman words are elements of Albanian language.""

I just joined Reddit so getting used to the platform. I am looking for HELP INTRO TO LINGUISTICS ONLINE QUIZ. I have until tmrw (Thursday, July,8,2021) to attempt and submit it! It'll be 10-15 multiple choice questions and I am willing to pay $15. I'm a non-traditional student that could use a helping hand!

More on the quiz's criteria:

Quiz 2 will be handled exactly like [Quiz 1](https://eclass.yorku.ca/eclass/mod/quiz/view.php?id=738764). You will have until tomorrow before midnight to attempt the quiz. You will get three attempts if you need them but your answers carry over! Each attempt is timed and once you start the quiz you will have 45 minutes to complete your attempt. The last attempt counts. Expect 10-15 questions.

As mentioned in lecture, it is on Transformational Grammar, Semantics, and the first part of Phonetics, i.e., what wasn't on the midterm up to last Wednesdays lecture on Phonetics. That includes the textbook chapter on Semantics—in particular pp 139-154 (Lexical Semantics) and 158-161 (Thematic Roles) which I did not include in lectures but you are still responsible for. (You won't have to draw trees involving transformations or do phonetic transcription. It's purely multiple choice.)

Anyone who can help, please get in touch ASAP!! I suppose you dm me. I'll be happy to share the textbook with you via EMAIL. I don't want to get too caught up trying to figure out Reddit atm.

Also, my uni's student portal has2factor authentication so for that I believe communiating via email would be most efficient - email me when you're about to log on and I'll approve the login attempt from my phone right then.

If I'm happy with your work, I'll hire you to do the remaining problem set and exam for this course as well! :)

I am thinking about stative adjectives and their composition (cf. Kratzer 2000: Building Statives, Spalek and Sæbø 2019: To Finish in German and Mainland Scandinavian: Telicity and Incrementality). I am curious whether I am understanding correctly what would happen compositionally when dealing with deverbal adjectives/participles built up from aspectual verbs that have sub-events as part of their semantics. Something like ""finish"" as in the paper by Spalek and  Sæbø (2019) I mentioned above. 

Assuming eventualities as a basic type *v* written as e or s (state) and verbs are *&lt;&lt;e,v&gt;,t&gt;* which I will write using P. Assuming a stativizing morpheme like in (i) from Spalek and Sæbø and that this combines with a predicate that involves sub-events as part of its semantics as in (ii) which is the lexical entry for ""finish eating"" from the same paper. 

(i) λPλxλs∃e RESULT(s)(e) ^ P(x)(e)
(ii) λxλe∃e′ eat(x)(e′) ^ FIN(e′)(e) where FIN(e') is true iff e is a final subpart of e' (there is no other subpart of e' which follows e; e is a final subevent of an eating event, e') 

By FA and beta reduction:

i. [λPλxλs∃e RESULT(s)(e) ^ P(x)(e)](λxλe∃e′ eat(x)(e′) ^ FIN(e′)(e))
ii. [λxλs∃e RESULT(s)(e) ^ (λxλe∃e′ eat(x)(e′) ^ FIN(e′)(e)) (x)(e)] iii. [λxλs∃e RESULT(s)(e) ^ (λx∃e∃e′ eat(x)(e′) ^ FIN(e′)(e)) (x)]
iv. [λxλs∃e RESULT(s)(e) ^ (∃e∃e′ eat(x)(e′) ^ FIN(e′)(e))]
v. [λxλs∃e∃e′ RESULT(s)(e) ^ eat(x)(e′) ^ FIN(e′)(e))]

Is the above correctly reduced or am I missing something? Thanks so much! (This is not homework btw, just trying to refresh my knowledge)",1625660859,natthrafninn,0,264,1686,36,4

I don't know if this is relevant, mods please delete, but a while ago, someone mentioned George Bernard Shaw's desire to fix English spelling by inventing a new alphabet and seemed to think nothing came of it.

I have a book which was given to my father in 1962 which I think is the only example of a book published in that new alphabet. It wasn't invented by Shaw himself, it was invented in a competition funded by his will. There's lots of detail in the book but as you can see it's a very old book and scanning it isn't easy.

The Shavian Alphabet is a phonetic alphabet, intended to be:

&gt; a more efficient alphabet of at least forty letters than the existing one of twenty-six letters to enable 'the said language to be written without indicating single sounds by groups of letters or by diacritical marks'.",1625642534,Negative12DollarBill,1,156,895,20,3

linguistics,"""Mary Ann"" Vowels in North American English","I'm venturing a theory that the vowels in ""Mary"" and ""Ann"" are created by same phonological process, namely [/æ/ tensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//%C3%A6/_raising). The latter is commonly referred as such, but I've never seen any sources propose it for the former.

There are three pieces of evidence that I would like to put forward in support of this theory:

* The first is of course the plain phonetic similarity of their typical realizations, which seems too obvious a match to ignore: \[ɛɚ\] and \[ɛ̃ə̃\].
* The second is that the regions that don't merge ""marry"" and ""Mary"" seem to be roughly those that similarly don't tense /æ/ when the following nasal is intervocalic, so the distinction between ""marry"" and ""Mary"" could be taken as akin to that between ""planet"" and ""plan it."" 
* Lastly, it seems that no accent whatsoever with generalized /æ/ raising distinguishes ""marry"" and ""Mary,"" even though some of them are geographically pretty close to some others in which that distinction is very robust. In fact, I've never met a *single* native speaker with generalized /æ/ raising who nonetheless distinguishes ""marry"" and ""Mary.""

linguistics,Reflexes of /lj/ vs /lgj/ in modern continental scandinavian,"Some words in Danish / Norwegian Bokmål that originally had /lj/ have a g inserted in spelling, such as vælge, sælge, but also some don’t, such as tælle. Additionally, the spurious g’s are pronounced in Bokmål-like spoken Norwegian only, but not in any other variant.

I can’t think of any set of regular changes that could have given this exact outcome. Any ideas?

| g in:   | Spoken |      | Spelling |      |
|---------|--------|------|----------|------|
| from:   | lgj    | lj   | lgj      | lj   |

| Nynorsk | Yes    | No   | Yes      | No   |

The main difficulties here are: 

1. why did the lg/ll split occur in the first place?

2. if lj merged into lgj first then regained g through hypercorrection, why is it pronounced in Bokmål, when neither the Danish (where the spelling got its influence) nor the Nynorsk-like spoken norwegian variants do?

1. Kinship names and titles (mom, dad, teacher, etc)
2. Basic daily expressions and common set phrases (hi, thank you, etc)
3. Random isolated words and sentences made up of a few words (really?, I see, etc)
4. Distinction between formal and informal language (specific to Korean) in verb endings (먹어/먹어요/먹습니다 for eating, etc)
5. Other frequent names, titles, words and expressions but which are more complex 
6. Distinction between formal and informal language in nouns (집/댁 for a house, etc)
7. Adverbs, linking words and word endings related to grammar points (지만, 는데, etc)
8. Making links between similar words and 'basic etymology' (학 is in common between 학교, 하색, 학원, 수학, etc)
9. Basic idioms (키가 막히다, etc)
10. Abbreviations and slang (초딩, etc)
11. More complex titles and words to describe human relationships (talking about the in-laws for example) and vocabulary and verbs related to more complex situations (names of diseases, nuances between verbs translated the same but used in different contexts etc)

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1625482813,AutoModerator,279,479,2762,96,17

Probably the first ones should be transcribed with two vowel symbols, while the second ones with a vowel and a semiconsonant (/j, w/), just like the so-called ""risng diphthongs"" that are always transcribed /jV, wV/, where /V/ indicates a generic vowel.

linguistics,Does it make sense logically to expect Africa to have more linguistic diversity than other places?,"In his most recent Lexicon Valley episode, John McWhorter says: ""Language has been there [Africa] the longest, so we would expect an extreme diversity of language families there"".

Does this really make sense? Since connections beyond, say, 15,000 years are irrecoverable, does it make any difference to the number of families in a region how long languages have existed there, after 15,000 years?

For example, suppose the first humans spread to Australia with a single language, covering the continent. After 15,000 years, there will be lots of different language families that can no longer be linked to each other. But give it another 15,000 years, and there's no reason to expect *more* language families necessarily, is there?

My list already includes MIT, Stanford, and other schools with a prominent impact on the world of linguistics research, and as much as I would love to bank on getting into one of them, it would be nice to have a fallback option and know that I can still study my passion.
* It's hard to tell linguistics programs apart. Which colleges are investing in their linguistics departments and funding research? Are certain programs more heavily focused on the computational aspect of linguistics, others more so on language preservation, historical linguistics, or things like speech and hearing sciences?

linguistics,"We figured out how Shakespeare sounded, but it's not as clear how Cervantes did. In this essay I will...","Hi all, last year I studied in Seville and took some linguistics classes as well as some literature classes. I thought it was really interesting how Spanish has evolved and I wanted to take a diachronic and diatopic approach to hypothesize what kind of phonemes Cervantes most likely used when speaking. I was really inspired to find this out after learning that Cervantes and Shakespeare lived in the same time period, but the way Cervantes spoke doesn't seem to be as well known as the way Shakespeare spoke.

The question is actually a lot more interesting than it sounds since linguistic changes were occuring on massive scales during Cervantes's lifetime. Around this time was when the dialect that we now associate with Latin America (and Southern Spain, the OG) became very distinct from the dialect we now associate with Central and Northern Spain. On top of this, further complicating matters is that Cervantes moved all over the place, had parents from different parts of Spain, and had exposure to many different social class environments.

The logic of the paper is that I tried to identify all the possible dialects Cervantes would have had significant exposure to, and then analyze his personal philosophies and linguistic background to hypothesize what dialect he most likely spoke. I was fortunate enough to find one article written by a scholar named Daniel Eisenberg who analyzed Cervantes's writing to find phonetic markers. At the end of my paper, I compare my theory to Eisenberg's analysis and see what similarities and differences we had in our conclusions. 

Just as a disclaimer, I did no ""original"" research and I did not go through all the original texts. All of my analysis was based on what more established scholars have written, and I just consolidated and analyzed them for my own project. I don't claim any expertise. I'm not entering academia least of all for Hispanic studies, but I am completing a Spanish BA degree. You can expect I don't have the depth of knowledge to be very sure that I haven't missed something, especially since my native language is not Spanish. I just did this because it was fun and very interesting. I think it was worth the months of research though!

Here's the powerpoint I made, accompanied by the essay I wrote. I think I took any identifying info out, but please let me know if I left anything in there.

linguistics,Why does it seem like languages with historical spelling sound more like the modern form than the ancient form at the halfway point between the stage the spelling is based on and the present day?,"Intuitively it seems like there should be no good reason for this to be the case, but in all three languages with historical orthography I have some familiarity with the history of:

* English spelling is based more or less on early-to-mid 1400s pronunciation. But when I listen to reconstructions of early-to-mid 1700s speech (halfway between now and the present day) it sounds much more like Modern English than early-to-mid 1400s English- Great Vowel Shift mostly or entirely complete, postvocalic /x/ dropped, consonant clusters like /kn/ reduced, etc.

* Greek spelling as it comes down to us today is based essentially on the Attic Greek of around 400 or 500 BCE. Halfway between then and the present day, so around 800 CE or so, length and pitch distinctions had collapsed, diphthongs had become monophthongs, voiced and aspirated stops had long since turned into fricatives, and in general it sounded much more like Modern Greek than the Attic that the spelling was initially based on.

* For Japanese, I can't find exactly when historical kana spelling is based on beyond ""some time in the Heian"" period, but assuming the earliest possible date within that time frame, around 800 or so, then the halfway point would be in the early 1400s. By then /wi/ and /we/ had already disappeared, intervocalic /w/ and /p/ had already merged, many diphthongs had already turned into monophthongs, and in general it sounded much more like Modern Japanese than the Late Old or Early Middle Japanese the kana spelling was based on.

Is this just a random effect of the three heavily historically spelled languages I happen to be somewhat familiar with the phonological history of, or is there some deeper reason, like the spelling tending for some reason to have been based on a conservative variety when it was first codified or semi-codified?",1625234074,Terpomo11,12,307,1838,195,35

linguistics,Can someone explain these examples of laboured enunciation of T sounds in American English? (links to videos in comments),"I've seen a few examples of speakers with otherwise normal American (or Canadian) accents, who for some reason really enunciate certain T sounds with the front of their tongue in a very unnatural-sounding way. 

An example is pronouncing both Ts in ""important"" as one would pronounce the T in ""tile"". It completely contradicts the usual more silent pronunciation and sounds really laboured and strange to me. It also results in surrounding vowel sounds changing in a strange way. 

For reference, the below speakers seem to make a marked effort to enunciate their T sounds (though they apply this effort quite inconsistently). 

* [Here](https://youtu.be/gA6L7pgcUbM?t=246), the speaker enunciates the double T in ""flattened"", yet pronounces other words like ""personality"" in a more typical way. 

* [Here](https://youtu.be/gA6L7pgcUbM?t=436) is the example I described above, of the same speaker enunciating the T in ""important"".

* [Here](https://youtu.be/aPkQ57cXrPA?t=518), the (Canadian?) speaker enunciates the T in ""heightened"" really strongly, yet later says ""hypnotic"" and ""repeated"" normally.

I was hoping someone here could tell me what this type of pronunciation is called, and offer any insight as to whether this is an accent or something they're doing intentionally, e.g. to sound more educated or authoritative?

linguistics,Does my office have a pigeon language?,"I’m no linguist and I hope this doesn’t sound like a bad linguistics post! 

I’m an English speaker who moved to a German speaking city in Central Europe and have a lot of interaction with speakers of German socially and through work. 

I’ve become really interested in the way that communication works between myself and others when we don’t really share a large amount of overlap. This post is specifically about how I speak with my team who all speak intermediate English.

I’ve noticed a few things in myself when I need to speak. Unsurprisingly, genders fall away when I speak (aside for describing people), as does the importance of word order. The other thing is that I use a lot of English words for more modern words sort of germanified, as I assume they’ve carried over, and French derived English words for older things. It doesn’t always work but it functions quite well. 

I’ve also noticed that German speakers will plug german nouns into English grammar. Not just the occasional word either but essentially most nouns. 

I’ve noticed they also favour French derived words from German or clear cognates to the extent that you wouldn’t really see these word choices being used in proper German. Outside of my office I do think “okay, now you have to speak by the book.”

I realised during a meeting that the language bring spoken wasn’t really German and it wasn’t really English, it wasn’t really the Denglish that people in this part of the word would be familiar with either. 

It’s been a year and a half and it’s slowly become like this, it wasn’t the slow painful German we used to speak. It’s only slightly less fast than speaking in English and only slightly less nuanced in what we can express.

Another thing I’ve noticed is we all use the same little words or phrases peppered about the place.

Of course, the grammar would move between German and English as we felt more confident or careful or as someone gets passionate but it would come back to this sort of hybrid.

The SVO proponents that I’ve read argue that the Polynesian VSO originated from a POc locative marker being reanalyzed as an object marker, but then this would require that POc intransitives were commonly VS. I have not actually seen any supporters of this argument discuss the intransitive word order, so I can’t be sure that this was actually the case. Also, languages with VS intransitives with SVO transitives, while certainly not impossible, are relatively rare. So I’m not completely sold on this argument.

Hungarian is difficult because it isn't anywhere related at all to Indo-European 

Xhosa is difficult because it has ""clicks"" to represent different consonants

Greenlandic is difficult because it has strange and wacky grammar

Navajo is difficult because it uses something called ""aspect"" which stresses the way that something is done.

\&gt; The above evidence is not partial or ambiguous. It is clear and sweeping: the elements of the culture common to the Rigveda and the Mitanni are not pre-Rigvedic (formed during some hypothetical period in Central Asia before the ""arrival"" of the Indo-Aryans ""into"" India). They are Late Rigvedic, i.e. they belong to the period of composition of the New Books.

Furthermore, the terminology by which he calls things ""retracted alveolar"" is something I don't understand. Namely, his (as seen in the appendix of attested inventories) use of the retracted alveolar terminology to describe every kind of lateral fricative implies he may have a non-standard definition of ""retracted alveolar"" that he uses to consider many sibilants retracted alveolar (making no destinction between contrastive retr.alveolar sibilants as in basque and old romance languages) and single-sibilant-PoA ""retracted alveolar.""

however, i struggle to understand how construction grammar(s) would deal with sequences like ""colourless green ideas"" (GG says it's meaningless) or ""married bachelor"". we have basic constructions at a word level [married, bachelor] and they form a ADJ-N construction. 

but the contradictory meaning seems to stem from the meanings of its elements (married vs bachelor; colourless vs green), and not just the contradictory meaning of the higher level construction.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1624878015,AutoModerator,345,479,2762,96,17

Since I have some spare time, I am planning to do that, however, I don't really have previous IT knowledge/skills but I believe I can learn at least basics and apply already existing models. I was wondering what topic/field of study would you suggest that would have perspectives in the future but having in mind my currently limited IT skills. I consider myself a practical person, so I would like to work on something that would be applicable in practice,  especially by businesses. Company contracts with researcher teams are quite common in my country, so I would not want to miss opportunities, since studying medieval poetry is very interesting, more often that not it does not result in financial/carreer gains.

linguistics,a brief overview of Samoyedic words of Turkic origin,"so far some 30 samoyedic words are detected to be Turkic in origin . for this reading you can check out [here](https://www.academia.edu/36564880/Turkic_lexical_borrowings_in_Samoyed) and [here](https://kpfu.ru/portal/docs/F230999094/01.pdf).

anyway , a direct borrowing from Proto Turkic to Proto Samoyedic is doubtful , as Peter Sauli Piispanen correctly utters : 

&gt;to my understanding, all suggested borrowings between Proto-Turkic and Proto Samoyed represent several different chronological layers over many centuries of time.

for a better understanding , we need to go deeper in Turkic words of Samoyedic languages . Anna Vladimirovna Dybo has compiled 21 possible Turkic borrowing into Proto Samoyedic and 6 possible words as vice versa direction. Dybo categorized Turkic loans into two packs  , common turkic and proto turkic , this , however , must not make us think that these words entered samoyedic via some common turkic languages , because poor attestation of Oghuric branch cognates makes us point out to only common turkic attested words. 

from 21 Proto Samoyedic  words of Turkic origin listed by Dybo , we are not linguistically able to determine which post-Proto Turkic branch was the source of borrowing in many cases , anyway , such linguistic methods help us determine the exact Turkic branch in some cases as follows (underlined with Red) :

given these arguments and the fact that some of these Turkic words are Oghuric ,  many other unclear loans must be interpreted as Oghuric as well , this endorses the fact that proto Samoyedic or perhaps different branches of samoyedic had contact with Oghuric branch of Turkic languages , neither Proto turkic nor common turkic branches",1624870096,jaqdpanther,0,321,2385,52,9

linguistics,"How did Vulgar Latin do the future before developing the ""to have"" construction?","As I understand it, Modern Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese etc. have future tenses derived from the infinitive + ""to have"", such as (ES) *comeré* ""I will eat"" from *comer* ""to eat"" + *he* ""I have"". There's also evidence that they were treated somewhat paraphrastically for centuries, and modern Portuguese still shows some signs of that. These future tenses don't derive from the Latin future tense forms. 

So my question is, do we know what the Vulgar Latin dialects used in the intervening period? Did they coexist, with the older future forms fading out over time? Or were the older forms lost first, and the dialects didn't have a clear future form for a while?

If that's the case, do we know what speakers did? Old English and Modern Japanese, as well as a whole bunch of other languages, use the ""present"" form for the future, with context indicating what time is meant. Did the romance dialects use a similar strategy?

linguistics,Suddenly understanding a language you couldn't understand 2 minutes ago.,"I'd like to share this story here because it seems to be the most fitting place to put it. Some background information about me, I am a Norwegian lad from rural western Norway, and I have had quite a lot of experience with Swedish. My family used to go to Sweden every summer so I can almost understand everything in a swedish conversation. 

So for the story: I was in my WW2 phase when I started to be very interested in the winter war, and especially Mannerheim (a prominent person in the war)
Thus I stumbled upon this video: https://youtu.be/RL852iEZ2zM
It is baisically just a copy of the famous hitler bunker scene.
Since Mannerheim was Finnish, I assumed the video was Finnish, and I could for the life of me figureout a single word. However, after the breakdown began I heard ""Vad i helvete är dette her?"" and was stunned. That was swedish. Then I remember a little fact about Mannerheim; he could not speak Finnish, only swedish. Thus, I rewatched the first minute of the video and I could understand everything perfectly. I cannot state this enough, I may have some trouble with swedish sometimes but I could understand all of it. I went from understanding nothing to everything. 

One thing to add though, they spoke with what I percieved to be a heavy Finnish accent. I know they were just speaking a Swedish dialect from Finland (with how they pronounced ""kärlejk""

Also, a question, is there a name to this phenomena?",1624753454,XxJoedoesxX,15,253,1432,72,10

linguistics,Ubykh orthography (just for fun),"Behold, the consonant inventory of Ubykh! This now-extinct Caucasian language is famous for having the largest number of consonant phonemes ever recorded in a non-click language (and, at the other extreme, having only two phonemic vowels.) Though it was well-document by linguists prior to its extinction, Ubykh was never a written a language and has never had any kind of official orthography. Various parties have proposed orthographies over the years, and just for fun I thought I'd try my hand at making my own. This is very much a work in progress that I just whipped together in a couple hours for shits and giggles, but I figured I'd post it and see what people thought. This will be an orthography using the Latin alphabet, designed for use by English speakers.  Representing the vast number of phonemes in the Latin alphabet will not be a simple matter, requiring many digraphs, trigraphs, and even quadrigraphs (tetragraphs?). While using four letters to represent a single sound is admittedly unwieldy, Ubykh thankfully almost never features clusters of more than two consonants in a row, which will prevent writing from getting \*too\* cluttered.

Many of these phonemes are also found (more or less) in English, so I'll start by simply assigning them the English letter which share their values (which are also often, but not always, their IPA symbols.) So the plain voiceless labial stop \[p\] will be represented by the letter /p/ and its voiced counterpart \[b\] by /b/, the plain voiceless alveolar stop \[t\] by the letter /t/ and its voiced counterpart \[d\] by the letter /d/, and the plain voicless velar stop \[k\] by the letter /k/ and its voiced counterpart \[g\] by the letter /g/; the voiceless labial fricative \[f\] by the letter /f/ and its voiced counterpart \[v\] by the letter /v/, the voiceless alveolar fricative \[s\] by the letter /s/ and its voiced counterpart \[z\] by the letter /z/, and the plain voiceless alveolar affricate  \[t͡s\] by the digraph /ts/ and its voiced counterpart  \[d͡z\] by the digraph /dz/; the labial nasal \[m\] by the letter /m/ and the alveolar nasal \[n\] by the letter /n/; the trill \[r\] by the letter /r/ and the lateral approximant \[l\] by the letter /l/; the palatal apprixmant \[j\] by the letter /y/ and the velar approximant \[w\] by the letter /w/; and the glottal fricative \[h\] by the letter /h/.

It also seemed logical to follow the IPA in using the letter /q/ for the plain voicless uvular stop \[q\], and in using apostrophes to mark ejectives, giving us /p' t' k' q' ts'/ representing  \[pʼ tʼ kʼ qʼ t͡sʼ\] . In terms of secondary articulations, labialization and palatalization can be marked by making di- and trigraphs with /w/ and /y/ respectively, giving us /tw dw tw' kw gw kw' qw qw'/ representing  \[tʷ dʷ tʷʼ kʷ gʷ kʷʼ qʷ qʷʼ\]  and /ky gy ky' qy qy'/ representing \[kʲ gʲ kʲʼ qʲ qʲʼ\].

Pharyngealization is the first place I ran into real trouble, as there is no standalone pharyngeal sound that I could use for digraphs. My first thought was to use /h/, so for example  \[pˤ\] would be represented as /ph/. I actually kind of like the look of this (though admittedly the particular digraph might be confusing to English speakers used to reading it as \[f\]). However, later in on the process I decided to use \[h\] digraphs for something else (we'll get to that.) The next thing I considered was using a dot beneath the letter, which often represents phryngealization in the romanization of Arabic. However, I could of disliked that for petty aesthetic reasons, and also decided they could be better elsewhere. I'm currently kind of between two options: using the letter /c/, which isn't used elsewhere, so  \[pˤ\] would be written as /pc/; or, because geminate consonants don't appear to be present in Ubykh, simply doubling the letter, so that  \[pˤ\] would be written as /pp/.  I'm eager to hear any suggestions on this front.

Now, on to the post-alveolars. There are three series here: standard post-alveolar, alveolo-palatal, and retroflex. I think the simplest way to do this would be to simply use a different diacritic to distingish the three. I think I'm leaning towards using a hacek for the postalveolars, so /š ž šw žw tš dž tš'/ representing \[ʃ ʒ  ʃʷ ʒʷ  t̠͡ʃ d̠͡ʒ t̠͡ʃʼ\] (and yes I'm aware that  \[t̠͡ʃ\] and  \[d̠͡ʒ\] are similar to the sounds represented by /ch/ and /j/ in English but for consitency's sake I'd rather use /tš/ and /dž/). The acute accent would be for alveolo-palatals, with  /ś ź św źw tś dź tś' tśw dźw tśw'/ representing  \[ɕ ʑ  ɕʷ  ʑʷ   t͡ɕ d͡ʑ t͡ɕʼ   t͡ɕʷ d͡ʑʷ t͡ɕʷʼ\], and a dot over top would represent the retroflexes, with /ṡ  ż t ṡ dż tṡ'/ representing  \[ʂ ʐ ʈ͡ʂ ɖ͡ʐ ʈ͡ʂʼ\]. I like the symmetry of it all.

For the lateral fricative  \[ɬ\] I considered /hl/, which seems like a good approximation of its pronunciation, and /ll/, which represents it in Welsh, but I think ultimately I'm going with /ł/, which represents the sound in the orthology of some Indigenous North American languages, such as Gwich'in.

And finally, the part that gave me the most trouble: the velar and uvular fricatives. I puzzled a bit over what to do with these. I briefly considered trying to somehow use /x/ and /j/, the only Latin consonant letters I hadn't used yet, but that seemed to be stretching things. Ultimately the reason I decided not to use /h/ to represent pharyngealizayion is because I thought it could be put to better use here. It's somewhat common to use the digraphs /kh gh/ to represent the velar fricatives  \[x ɣ\], and from that I extrapolated /qh/ for the voiceless uvular stop  \[χ\], and /qhy qhw qhc qhcw/ for its variations  \[χʲ χʷ χˤ χˤʷ\]. That last tetragraph (quadragraph?) is definitrly starting to get a little ridiculous, but I was running low on brain power by this time, and that what all of my previous established patterns gave me.This left another puzzle for what to do with the voiced uvular fricative  \[ʁ\], as there was no voiced uvular stop for me to add an /h/ to. Ultimately, I went with /rh rhy rhw rhc rhcw/. The uvular fricative is represent by an /r/ in languages like French and German, and its IPA symbol is derived from /r/. It's not a great solution, but it's the best I could come up with. 

And that's what I've got! A full orthography representing all 84 Ubykh consonant phonemes. What do you guys think? What might you have done differently? Please, let me know!

linguistics,Is there any general explanation or theory as to why interjections tend to have larger phoneme inventories and less phonotactic restrictions than the lexical level does?,"In English, for example, \[u\] and \[ɪu\] don't contrast at the lexical level in English, but they contrast the interjections /u/ (""ooo, that's a nice car!"") and /ɪu/ (ie: ""eeww, that's disgusting"")

Another example is that at the lexical level, /ɛ/ and /æ/ cannot be word final, but there are interjections like ""meh"" (/mɛ/), ""eh"" (/ɛ/), ""bleh"" (/blɛ/),  ""ahh"" (/æ/) and ""nah"" (/næ/)

There are a bunch more examples in English but this isn't an English only phenomenon.

In Dakota, vowel stress can only be on the first or second syllable, and this is rigid because the stress shifts when prefixes are added, yet **stress appears on later syllables in interjections**.

In Luiseño, from what I've read *(admittedly a small amount)*, there are claimed to be three phonemic vowel lengths, but **""double long"" vowels seem to only appear in interjections**.

Also keep in mind that the examples I gave, the way I see it, cannot be interpreted as paralinguistic gestures like ""shhh"", ""psst"", ""hmmm"", ""bzzzz"", ""brrr"", etc.. I was very careful with the examples I chose to give, because although onamonapia can explain things like ""bzzz"", ""brr"", ""pssst"", and so on, it doesn't explain Dakota stress irregularities in interjections, nor /u/ vs. /ɪu/ in English interjection, etc.

So I (English) was talking to a friend who is Greek about whether or not it would be statistically easier to play Scrabble in Greek with a Greek alphabet, since they have less letters (24 against the 26 in the Latin alphabet).

This then lead onto a discussion about average word lengths and average number of vowels per word. In English the average word length is about 8.23 characters, whereas in Greek the average word length is 10.92 ([http://www.ravi.io/language-word-lengths](http://www.ravi.io/language-word-lengths)). When it comes to the average number of vowels I could not find much reliable information on either the English or the Greek statistic.

There is also suffixes and prefixes to add to the equation as well. This is harder in Greek as most word endings change when you make them plural.

Isn't prescriptivism itself a naturally occurring part of language?,"First, to clarify: I know that linguistics is descriptive. I have read several posts on this subreddit and others stating that there is no dichotomy between descriptivism and prescriptivism in linguistics, and that all linguists are descriptivists (although I hear different things about how linguistics is practised in Eastern Europe). I am aware of this.

That said, I'm not sure why linguists (or people with linguistics qualifications) on the internet seem bent on insulting anyone with prescriptive beliefs. Most of the time, the gist of the message seems to be: 'Descriptivism is science; prescriptivists are no better than flat-Earthers.' There is a marked tendency to treat the prescriptivist as stupid or dangerous, when most of the time they are just repeating a bit of traditional grammar they learned in school. Why demonise them? Prescriptivism makes normative judgements in language. This seems, well, normal to me, because human beings in general tend to make normative judgements on a lot of things. Such judgements are a naturally occurring feature of human behaviour. Prescriptivism has occurred naturally in many languages since antiquity, and influences the way languages have developed. 

For example, the modern Turkish language is a product of language planning in the 1930s, replacing Persian and Arabic loanwords with newly-coined words from native Turkic roots. An essentially prescriptive policy intended to ""purify"" the language (whatever you might make of that) and moreover one that *worked*. Ottoman Turkish is said to have been 88% Arabic and Persian in its vocabulary; Modern Turkish is 89% Turkish and only about 7% Arabic and Persian. Clearly, the prescription was successful and had a real effect on Turkish usage. I don't know, maybe if a modern-day linguist had been around to criticise them, the Turkish language planners would have decided prescription was useless and given up.

Rather than acknowledging prescription as a substantial influence on language and giving prescriptivist thinkers their say, linguists tend to treat prescriptivism as a social evil, something to be resisted and fought. Why?",1624531113,r_Hodgeheg,4,331,2142,129,19

linguistics,"How are Arabic Numerals, and symbols like &lt;&amp; % = +&gt;, morphemic?","

&gt;### 2.2 Relationship to Language

&gt;A primary consideration for us is to determine what linguistic level graphemes
represent. In the Roman alphabet, the letters are related to some level of the phonology;
however, **the numerals &lt;1, 2, 3&gt; etc. are all related to morphemes [emphasis mine]**. All writing
systems seem to have some variation as to the linguistic level involved, but we
can often usefully speak of the level of language which is primarily related to the
graphemes of a writing system.

Henry Rogers, *Writing Systems* (2004), p 13.

&gt;This taxonomic scheme has a certain amount of validity to it, but on closer
examination, it is problematic. First, writing systems are taxonomically 'messy'.
Writing systems are mixtures of some sort or other. Sometimes, the mixture is
relatively small and can be set aside. Finnish is often cited for its simple one-to-one
relationship between grapheme and segment. We saw in chapter 9 that there are
three minor exceptions to this relationship, and also, like most modern writing
systems, Finnish uses **Arabic numerals, as well as symbols such as &lt;&amp; % = +&gt;,
which are clearly morphemically based [emphasis mine]**. If Finnish were our worst case of typological
mixture, we probably would not worry a great deal.

One could refer to thighs in English as, well, thighs of course, and “hams” rarely. But it is still valid. 

In Chinese (Mandarin), 腿 means both leg and ham, while 大腿 means thighs. 

Notice the connections right? Now, Spanish doesn’t have this specific ambiguity between the two.

linguistics,would it be wrong of me to completely avoid teaching my future child my native language?,"I (F22) am originally from Russia but my parents and I moved to America when I was 3 years old.

linguistics,"Inter-word phonemes; phrasal phonemes… just basic allophones, or something more?","Usually pairs of sounds are said to be in contrastive distribution when swapping them can (or does) create a new word. 

But what I want to talk about is something I've never read about, only noticed for myself, but I'm sure the phenomena has a formal name, so **if anyone knows that name, please inform!** For now, I'm calling them phrasal phonemes.

The aspirated and tenuis plosives are said to be in complimentary distribution in English. I'll use /k/ to briefly summarize the distribution.

**/k/ is aspirated \[kʰ\] when:**

*1. It's the onset of a stressed syllable, whether that's before a vowel (ie: ""kick""; \[kʰɪk\]) or a liquid (ie: ""clan""; \[kʰlæn\]) \[exception: rule #3).*

*2. It's the first sound of a word before an unstressed vowel (ie: ""constrain""; \[kʰən 'streɪn\])*

**/k/ is tenuis \[k\] when:**

*3. It's in an /sk/ onset cluster (ie: ""skill""; \[skɪl\])*

*4. It's the onset in an unstressed syllable (ie: ""token""; \['tʰoʊ.kən\]) \[exception: rule #2\]*

*5. It is the final sound of a word and the next word starts with a vowel (ie: ""pick any""; \['pɪk '*[*ɛ.ni*](https://ɛ.ni)*\])*

*As a side note, this is at least the distribution for my speech. Perhaps the distribution isn't the same for you.*

&amp;#x200B;

Why do allophones exist? It seems like some allophones just exist for **articulatory convenience**. Palatalization happens because it's more convenient to use a palatal or post-alveolar consonant before a front vowel because the tongue is in the same area.

Some allophones seem to exist to **expand the articulatory cues between similar sounds**, such as vowel lengthening in English when there is a voiced coda. This can help distinguish ""wheat"" and ""weed"", especially when the final plosives are unreleased, and ""bus"" and ""buzz"", especially when the final /z/ is partially or fully devoiced in pausa.

But what I'm here to inquire, discuss about is that some seeming allophones seem to have the function of **distinguishing minimal pairs on the phrasal level** (hence ""phrasal phonemes""). Here are some examples that distinguish between three levels of voice onset time in English if our analysis takes pace on the phrasal level instead of the word level.

&amp;#x200B;

**Example #1:** ""pecan"" \[ˈpʰiˌkʰɑn\], ""peak on"" \[ˈpʰiˌkɑn\], ""pee gone"" \[ˈpʰiˌgɑn\]

*""Don't peak on the man making his pee gone as he eats a pecan""*... a pretty silly sentence, but hey it works!

This isn't not a suitable example for many speakers, such as those that cannot copula drop (""pee gone"") and in general the pronunciation of ""pecan"" varies a lot depending on the dialect, but the cot-caught merger shouldn't effect the harmony between the /ɑ/ or /ɔ/vowels.

&amp;#x200B;

**Example #2:** ""key pit"" \[kipʰɪt\], ""keep it"" \[kipɪt\], ""key bit"" \[kibɪt\]

Maybe not the best example as the stress on ""it"" might be reduced, but if it's in pausa it will have some stress.

&amp;#x200B;

**Example #3:** ""we came"" \[wiˈkʰeɪm\], ""weak aim"" \[wiˈkeɪm\], ""we game"" \[wiˈgeɪm\]

""Weak aim"" might not sound idiomatic to some people, but for me ""weak"" can be used to describe any lacking ability or skill, ie: ""your dribbling is weak"", ""your presentation abilities are weak"" or ""their point guard has a weak passing game""

&amp;#x200B;

And the following two examples have \[ɾ\] distinguishing a phrase from \[tʰ\] and \[d\]

**Example #4:** ""a tall"" \[ə'tʰɑl\], ""at all"" \[ə'ɾɑl\], ""a doll"" \[ə'dɑl\]

* *""I don't know a tall man!""*
* *""I don't know at all man!""* (formally written like ""at all, man""… but at least for me, that comma doesn't indicate any prosodic pause)
* *""I don't know a doll man!""* (somewhat nonsensical, but let's say a ""doll man"" is a man who collects dolls)

&amp;#x200B;

**Example #5:** ""may taze"" \[meɪtʰɪez\], ""made As"" \[meɪɾeɪz\], ""may daze"" \[meɪdeɪz\]

* *""you may daze off after the introduction""*
* *""you made As last semester""*
* *""you may taze me after I urinate""*

There are a lot more which just contrast an aspirated plosive and a tenuis plosive, such as ""sea kit"" and ""seek it"", but I thought it was only salient to document phrases that contrasted all three.

&amp;#x200B;

**Discussion**

Anyway, these feel more important or essential than other allophones. Like if I look at this from a language teaching perspective, it seems like it's more important to teach these ""phrasal phonemes"" than other allophones. Typically, if allophones aren't used, the pronunciation might sound ""off"" or sound less natural, but it never changes the meaning. But the examples I provided, meaning is changed depending on the ""allophone"" used. Of course, which allophone is used is completely predictable. So paradoxically, it is simultaneously contrastive and predictable.

**Do you think these should be considered different phonemes or not?** I see arguments for both sides. Like, allophones don't contrast meaning with each other; you can't find minimal pairs or minimal triplets by switching allophones. But on the other hand, phonemes aren't predictable via phonological processes, and individual words cannot contrast with these pairs / triplets.

**How important should the phrase level be when deciding if certain sound pairs are in contrastive distribution? Should this decision be exclusive to word level analysis?** I don't know, which is why I called them phrasal phonemes. My current stance is that they aren't ""phonemes"" but they also cannot be analyzed as being in ""complimentary distribution"", so they're something different.

My last question is: **Do any of you know any other examples of this ""phrasal phoneme""**, whether that's in English or another language?

There are some words some people consider to be swear words but others don't. For example, hell, prick, piss, damn, or crap. Also, would someone still be able to say damn if they were referring to a hydroelectric dam? Or would they curse 1 second, then draw a blank when referring to the nonvulger noun? Can someone in this situation still use curse words for their meaning (like f@$% to refer to intercourse) or only shout them out when angry or in pain?

Another example I can think of is I used to hear little kids counting with 'Alligator' so, they'd say 1alligator2alligator3alligator to space the words and keep to seconds. Most people want to count faster than seconds and that's why I think these words are put there the way they are.

linguistics,Vowel length notation - any way to represent an extra long vowel?,"hey, I was wondering if there's any way to mark vowels that are very long.

here's an example; I recently encountered the Hebrew word ההעתקה - 'the copying' (which would probably be transcribed as something like haha'ataka) for most young modern Hebrew speakers it seems to be realized as an extra long vowel, 3 times the length of a regular a.

basically, adjacent syllables that have the same vowel tend to merge if they have the letters א/ע/ה (h/') separating them. 

so I know sometimes long vowels are represented like this  ā   
but I don't feel like it really gives the reader a good idea of how long the vowel actually is. it would seem accurate for a word like אהבה - love (ahava) where only 2 vowels merge, which sounds much more like a typical long vowel by what I've heard so far from various languages. writing āva is pretty much a perfect phonetic writing of the word.

linguistics,"What really is the definition of ""sexual act""?","I'm not sure where this question is appropriate. I'm posting here because it has to do with definitions, but please let me know if there are more appropriate subreddits (I'm also not here to see what someone subjectively finds ""gross"", this is supposed to be an educational post, so if there is something in this post you find ""gross"", please do not read any further). 

I want to know what it means when someone says they just had ""sex"". 

""Sex"" is not just ""an activity in which one's genitalia is stimulated by the genitalia of another"", no. There are different types of ""sex"", such as oral sex in which one's genitalia is stimulated by the mouth of another, and anal sex in which one's genitalia is stimulated by the anus of another. 

There's cunnilingus and analingus. Cunnilingus is an activity in which a woman's genitalia is stimulated by someone else's mouth or tongue. It's a type of oral sex. Analingus is an activity in which someone's anus is stimulated by someone else's mouth or tongue. 

But that's where I'm confused. So far, everywhere I've looked oral sex has been defined as ""when someone uses their mouth to sexually stimulate the genitals of someone else"". Anus is not a genital, so how can analingus be considered oral sex? 

Either the definition of oral sex should change to include analingus, or we should consider analingus another form of sex, different from oral sex. 

But then there are many other questions. If analingus is a form of sex, or sexual activity, eventhough there are no genitals involved (it's just mouth and anus), why wouldn't other forms of activity that do not involve a genitalia be considered sex? For example, kissing, which is when someone's mouth stimulates someone else's body parts, such as mouth, hand, etc, etc.

Why wouldn't kissing be considered a sexual act or sex, just as analingus is? 

And if oral sex is a form of sex eventhough only one genital is present, why wouldn't masturbation be considered a form of sex? There is a genitalia involved in masturbation, which is stimulated by the hands, or other objects such as toys. This is exactly similar to oral sex in which only one genital is present, so why wouldn't masturbation be considered sex, or a sexual activity? 

And if masturbation can be considered a sexual activity, why wouldn't that mean anyone who has ever masturbated is not a ""virgin"" anymore as they have already had sex, in the form of masturbation? 

Or why wouldn't that mean anyone who has ever had oral and/or anal sex is not a virgin anymore, as they have already has sex, in the forms of oral and anal sex? 

There are some people who still think they are ""virgins"" even if they had oral and anal sex. But if these two are forms of sexes, how can someone still be a ""virgin"" after having them? 

What even is the definition of ""virginity""? If it means ""someone who has never had sex"", then the sex includes oral and anal sex, and anyone who has ever had oral and anal sex, is not a ""virgin"" anymore. 

That's the case if masturbation and kissing are considered sex or sexual activity too. Anyone who has ever kissed someone somewhere, it doesn't have to be another mouth, or has masturbated even once is not a ""virgin"" anymore.

linguistics,Expletive / Pleonastic / Paratactic negation in before clauses in English and Finish,"Hi everyone, I require your help. I am currently trying to find out about a particular instance of expletive negation i.e. expletive negation in so called before clauses. In German (and French as well though I won't go into this here) the negation in a negative before clause attached to a negative matrix clause is often 'expletive' i.e. it does not have a truthconditional effect and can be left out. E.g.:

&amp;#x200B;

1.  Paul will       nicht  in die Uni             kommen, bevor     er (nicht) geimpft      wurde

Paul wants  not     in the university come         before  he not     vaccinated was

Paul doesn't want to go to the university before he got vaccinated

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly, while the negator in the before-clause is optional, its presence is highly confusing (maybe even ungramamtical), if the negation in the matrix clause is absent:

2.  Paul will      ?/\*(nicht)  in die Uni             kommen, bevor     er (nicht) geimpft      wurde

Paul wants  not     in the university come         before  he not     vaccinated was

Paul doesn't want to go to the university before he got vaccinated

3.  Never say it won't work before you haven't tried at least once!

linguistics,What's the reasoning behind Proto-Polynesian having *w as opposed to *v?,"Not sure if this is the best place for this question but I haven't been having much luck trying to track down an answer in my searchings

The standard reconstruction of Proto-Polynesian has \*w, which becomes /v/ almost universally in Polynesian languages (actually even more universally than I thought until I looked at it again for this post)

Probably the most globally well-known Polynesian languages, Hawaiian and Māori (both from the Central-Eastern subfamily), are exceptions to this although even Hawaiian's /w/ has allophonic variation with \[v\]. Aside from these two, the few other Polynesian languages I can find with /w/ are apparently all fairly distant outliers in the majority non-Polynesian-speaking regions of Melanesia and Micronesia (getting my wordlists from [Pollex](https://pollex.shh.mpg.de/entry/waka.a/)).

So I'm wondering if anyone here knows any specifics behind using \*w rather than \*v in the reconstruction? I know proto-languages aren't based on majority rules and don't intend to represent exact phonemic qualities but with that in mind I'm still pretty stumped on what the reasoning might be.",1624295139,langisii,28,169,1128,72,11
linguistics,The semantic nuances between the simple past and the perfect past in English,"***Purposes of this thread***

*1. I want to know if you guys have the same sense of the nuances I provide here*

*2. I want to know if you guys are aware of other semantic nuances between these two tense-aspects in English*

For me, in most contexts it seems that **the perfect past can be inconsequentially swapped with the simple past**; that is, no nuance is lost by using the simple past in place of the perfect past. Often times prescriptivists argue that the perfect past must be used to indicate the later of two past events when joined by a conjunction, ie: *""I had already lost the keys by the time he arrived""*, but for me at least, there is no difference if we use two simple past clauses *(""I already lost the keys by the time he arrived""*), not in meaning nor idiomatics.

But I was thinking of how to phrase something I wanted to say and by chance I used both the simple past and the perfect past in these thoughts, and I was talking about a recurrent experience in the past tense, using ""usually"", and when I used the perfect past, to me it gave the nuance of ""**distant past**"".

* *1a. ""What usually happened to me was that the effects of overtraining manifested within one day, not incrementally throughout a week.""*
* *1b. ""What usually had happened to me was that the effects of overtraining manifested within one day, not incrementally throughout a week.""*

And then I just thought of some more examples to see if the semantic effect remained

* *2a. They usually got drunk while they worked*
* *2b. They usually had gotten drunk while they worked*
* *3a. You usually boiled your cereal before you ate it.*
* *3b. You had usually boiled your cereal before you ate it.*
* *4a. I usually watched TV while stretching.*
* *4b. I had usually watched TV while stretching.*

To me, when the perfect past is used, it seems to be more **temporally distancing** and it can be even distancing in like a, ***""I disavow from it now tho""*** *type of way* (ie: *""I usually had used cheesy pick-up lines while tryna' meet women""*)

So does anyone else get a remote past or distancing sense with *""usually"" + the perfect past*?

I also have a hard time explaining this next one, but I also feel like there is a ""responsibility distancing"" or a type of ""**agency distancing**"" when I hear and use the perfect past instead of the simple past in simple sentences (*that is, sentences with only one clause*). For example, here's a dialogue:

* Person 1: ""Did you clean the kitchen yet?""
* Person 2: ""I had tried but…""

Or

*Person 1: ""Did you bake the birthday cake yet?""*

*Person 2: ""Well I had written an exam yesterday so…""*

Does anyone else interpret that perfect past as some type of ""agency distancer"" in these contexts?

And then finally, I am wondering if there are other contexts you're aware of where if you swapped out the simple past and the perfect past, that there actually is a semantic nuance.",1624286892,ling_Q,50,525,2912,76,13

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1624273217,AutoModerator,150,479,2762,96,17

linguistics,What's the opposite phenomenon to allomorphy?,"Hello there! Small premise: I'm relatively new to linguistics. I'm a sophomore at Sapienza University of Rome, where I study Linguistic and Intercultural Mediation. Last year, I took the exams of General Linguistics and of Portuguese Phonetics and Phonology. Next month, I'm going to take Portuguese Morphology and Syntax. However, while I was studying, I was assailed by doubt.

An allomorph is a phonetically different morph that realizes the same morpheme of another morph. For example, in Portuguese, **-es** is an allomorph of **-as** (and vice versa), as they both realize the morpheme **IND.PRES.2SG**:

* pt. *falas*  
fal-as  
speak-IND.PRES.2SG
* pt. *bebes*  
beb-es  
drink-IND.PRES.2SG

Is there an opposite phenomenon to allomorphy, that is when different morphemes can be realized by the same morph? For example, in French, the morphemes **IND.PRES.1SG**, **IND.PRES.2SG**, **IND.PRES.3SG** and **IND.PRES.3PL** are realized (phonetically speaking!) by the same morph:

* fr. *je* *mange* /ʒə mɑ̃ʒ/  
je mɑ̃ʒ-∅  
1SG eat-IND.PRES.1SG
* fr. *tu* *manges* /ty mɑ̃ʒ/  
tu mɑ̃ʒ-∅  
2SG eat-IND.PRES.2SG
* fr. *il* *mange* /il mɑ̃ʒ/  
il mɑ̃ʒ-∅  
3SG eat-IND.PRES.3SG
* fr. ils mangent /il mɑ̃ʒ/  
ils mɑ̃ʒ-∅  
3PL eat.IND.PRES.3PL

This is also the reason why the pronominal subjects can't be dropped in French. Otherwise, it would be impossible to understand the subject of the verb, even though this already happens, as *il mange* and *ils mangent* are pronounced in the exact same way.

At first, I thought that the same thing happens in English, as the morphemes **\*PAST.SIMPLE.1SG**, **...**, **\*PAST.SIMPLE.3PL** are realized by the same morph, **-ed**. However, the solution to this problem was easier than I thought: the morph **-ed** doesn't mark the verb's person and number, but only the tense, because it's the subject that marks them.

* en. *I worked*  
I work-ed  
1SG work-PAST.SIMPLE
* en. *you worked*  
you work-ed  
2SG work-PAST.SIMPLE

Coming back to my question, is there an opposite phenomenon to allomorphy?",1624208794,cawdtanem,3,310,2045,45,6
linguistics,How does fundamental frequency of speech relate to formant ratios?,"TLDR: How does a higher fundamental frequency increase the ""frequency distance"" between formants?

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone,

I'm having real trouble understanding one small part of a paper called **'Major and minor music compared to excited and subdued speech'** 

link (no paywall):  [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel\_Bowling/publication/40896882\_Major\_and\_minor\_music\_compared\_to\_excited\_and\_subdued\_speech/links/5429126f0cf238c6ea7cf04b.pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel_Bowling/publication/40896882_Major_and_minor_music_compared_to_excited_and_subdued_speech/links/5429126f0cf238c6ea7cf04b.pdf)

I understand almost all of the paper and have a pretty good knowledge of the fundamentals of speech  production –or at least I thought I did.  What is driving me crazy is the following passage:

*The difference between the fundamental frequencies of  excited and subdued speech also affects the prevalence of specific formant ratios. Given the same voiced speech sound, the positions of the first and second formants are relatively stable between excited and subdued speech (as they must be to allow vowel phonemes to be heard correctly). The higher fundamental frequencies of excited speech, however, increase the frequency distance between harmonics, causing lower harmonics to underlie the first and second formants. As a result the F2/F1 ratios in excited speech tend to comprise smaller numbers and thus more often represent musical intervals defined by smaller number ratios. Conversely, the lower fundamental frequencies in subdued speech decrease the distance between harmonics, causing higher harmonics to underlie the formants. Thus the F2/F1 ratios in subdued speech tend to comprise larger numbers, which more often represent musical intervals defined by larger number ratios* (Pages 500 – 501).

&amp;#x200B;

1. If the positions of the first and second formants are **stable** between excited and subdued speech then how can a higher fundamental frequency ""increase the frequency distance between harmonics"" –what is meant by ""frequency distance"" in this case?
2. How does this increased frequency distance ""cause lower harmonics to underlie the first and second formant""? –what harmonics are being lowered?  (the formants have stayed where they are, the F0 has risen)
3. Not being able to understand 1 and 2 means that I can't understand how "" F2/F1 ratios in excited speech tend to comprise smaller numbers*""*

If anyone could shed any light on this I would be really really grateful

Many thanks,

linguistics,A career in linguistics and/or language/culture preservation,"Linguistics is a passion of mine, I love languages. While not being someone specifically interested in culture, I absolutely hate thinking of languages and other forms of culture and history being erased or undocumented. If I could help preserve endangered culture or language that'd be amazing. Other than that I made linguistics a hobby of mine, I've spent a lot of time studying and learning about it.

There's a few things I'm worried about though. I imagine linguists don't make much money in terms of salary... I've always been a person who want's to have my own house, property, pretty big but not extremely so. I wanted to be an astrophysicist for a lot of my life, and it actually seemed to be the only career I was interested in that made good money... $70k-$110k a year is a LOT. Expectedly, with that yearly payment there's also a lot of college you have to go through for it. In order to really work in astrophysics you have to gain a PhD, 8-10 years (at least) of rigorous uni... stuff, and I don't know if I can go through that without turning insane. There's various reasons (that I'm working on), but I'll just say I don't think it's the best idea just yet. So taking that in mind, you can imagine I don't fancy a job that pays a lot less... It might sound stupid, I *do* know with anything academic that pays well I should expect to do very hard work and to spend a long time. But things related to history, culture, literature, etc. all seem like they pay much less than other academic subjects with similar requirements. Which is very unfortunate because - other than physics - history/geography/geopolitics &amp; linguistics have been my hobby and passion. The best I can do is hope I can get myself to a point where I'm ready to take on a PhD for astro.

I'm also a very stay-at-home person, i.e. I'm not that fond of travelling to far away places to do work much. Which really conflicts with my wants to preserve culture and all, but... hey, I can get over it if it's my job. Travelling across the globe a lot and staying with some community for a while might be fun anyways.

Also I'm kind of bad at language learning (other than pronunciation and learning ABOUT the language), but that may be my own fault lol. Much worse is I've always hated and/or sucked at: Analysing texts (in English/Language class), writing constructed responses (in most classes), actually anything you'll find in your grade school native language classes other than memorising vocab.

So what I think I should do is major in physics or a similar or similar-paying field, and minor in linguistics... but I don't know, I'm nearing senior year in high school so my time to decide what I want to do to prepare me for life is running out.

linguistics,Please critique my ideas on the subject of 'pronunciation vs. accent',"*tl;dr*  ***I don't see a clear difference between accent and pronunciation, to me an accent is the way you speak (pronounce) the words/sentences, it's the set of 'sound' elements that you use, and on the other hand every 'pronunciation' brings an accent along with it, there's no such thing as unaccented pronunciation, therefore it makes no sense to separate these two concepts. So those ESL teachers who make it a point to differentiate the two are either wrong or they're trying to be tactful about a controversial topic and in doing so end up describing a concept that's not exactly accurate. Am I right? Completely wrong? Please pick apart my reasoning.***

 

 Hey folks. So, basically I've taught myself English, and more recently I've been trying (also on my own) to delve a bit deeper into the phonological part of the language. Well, one thing that stood out and has been peeving me is the fact that 'mainstream' ESL teachers and content creators on the internet (and even native speakers of English who answer questions on ESL subreddits) all seem to fervently distinguish between pronunciation and accent (by accent I'm referring to the sociolinguistical concept).

To me that makes no sense, maybe I'm missing something, but if I understand correctly, pronouncing (along with the prosody) the same words differently (on a phonetic or phonemic level) is precisely what characterizes a certain accent, in fact, that's how phoneticians can describe different accents in the first place. For instance, the 'pronunciation' of the word 'certain' could be given as \[ˈsɛːɹtn̩\] for one Irish accent, \[ˈsɜːtn\] for a Southern English accent and \[ˈsɝːrtn\] for a General American accent, and to me there's no way one could pronounce 'correctly' (i.e. following the given model down to the allophones) and not sound like the one it's meant to sound. You could't read \[ˈsɛːɹtn̩\] and make it sound like the Southern English transcription.

From what I can tell, this whole 'accent =\\=. pronunciation' argument seems to be more based on common sense than on anything else. Maybe with the (noble) intention of making us ESL learners 'not worry too much' or not feel self-conscious about how we sound, which a sensitive issue, teachers will say things such as: 'work on your pronunciation but don't worry about your accent' or 'pronunciation is important but having an accent doesn't matter'.

When I hear that what I understand is that they're equating 'work on your pronunciation' with 'acquire enough elements of the English phonology to be intelligible' and 'don't worry about your accent' with 'don't go through the trouble of mastering every single element of one particular variety of English', so in fact it'd be a matter of 'how much' rather than 'whether' to make an effort to learn it or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I right in my way of thinking here, or at least on the right path? Thanks in advance!

linguistics,homophonic puns containing animals in Mandarin?,"I feel like Chinese people are obsessed with creating homophones containing animals or insects.

草泥马 grass mud horse (llama) —&gt; F U
河蟹 river crab —&gt; censorship
雅蠛蝶 Yamie butterfly —&gt; derived from Japanese yamete (often heard in porn)

While most of these 10 mythical creatures are rarely seen now, new ones are constantly being invented as the online community grew larger and larger. Some of the newer ones include:
脆皮鸭文学 gay literature —&gt; crispy duck literature
鸭头 girl —&gt; duck head
乌鸡鲅鱼 I’m fking speechless —&gt; black chicken and spanish mackerel

Traditionally, there are also many associated with the Chinese new year. For example people would eat fish during spring festivals because it can form homophones with some sort of blessing. (年年有鱼)

I read that there are tons of puns in Chinese languages due to their smaller inventories and puns are a very important component of the languages. There are of course many other types of homophonic puns in Mandarin but I feel like they don’t stick around for that long compared to the ones containing living creatures.

If this sound were first found in a native Australian language or a Mayan language, something tells me it would have just been labeled as x^j or something and been done with it, but the fact that it's Swedish, perhaps one of the earliest languages they transcribed in IPA, it would have been an odd outlier. This is just my speculation of course.

Or maybe I'm wrong? Is this sound somehow really rare and special amongst world languages? 

Like what is with the one IPA character for 'that one sound in Swedish we haven't really figured out yet'? It just seems so odd given that countless other languages have been transcribed just fine. I get that there can be debate about what a sound is and that its different in different dialects and speakers, but other languages haven't gotten a special character for debated sounds.

linguistics,Mixing Politness Pronouns in French,"Hi /r/linguistics! 

Quick warning that this post contains spoilers for the show Call my Agent, I've tried to mark them where possible.

I've been watching the French Netflix show Call my Agent (Dix Pour Cent) recently, and I'm absolutely loving it. And while watching I've started to notice that the way characters use the politeness pronouns tu &amp; vous is completely different to what I'm used to in my native German.

A lot of the staff at the agency seem to switch pretty fluidly between formal and informal address, using ""tu"" in one scene and then ""vous"" in the next. I only remember one scene where Sofia openly asks Gabriel, &gt;!when he takes her on as a client!&lt;, if ""on peut se tutoyer?"". Other than that, it all seems implicit and I cannot for the life of me figure out what the rules are.

I haven't got to that part yet, but I read that there's a joke between Mathias and Noémie &gt;!after their affair has been going on for a while, he suddenly uses ""tu"" and she's all taken aback by it. I couldn't possibly imagine being intimate with someone and still addressing them formally,!&lt; that just goes against my instinct for how I relate to people around me. 

There are also some cases where an agent uses informal address to their assistant, while the assistant responds using formal address. In German this would be extremely disrespectful on part of the higher status person, the agent in this case. I can't think of any setting where a politeness imbalance is acceptable, outside of adults speaking to children. In German, if someone addresses me informally, I address them back the same way. 

I guess my question is, is this something the creators are using deliberately for humourous effect, or is politeness in French actually this fluid? Any input would be much appreciated!",1623923489,Idontevenlikecheese,17,312,1804,35,5
linguistics,"What exactly does ""decriminalization"" mean?","My understanding of ""decriminalization"" was that it referred to removing criminal penalties for an illegal offense while still keeping it illegal, as distinct from legalization. 

But in modern discourse, specifically when it comes to legalizing marijuana, the term ""decriminalization"" seems to mean contradictory things to different people. The governor of Louisiana signed a bill that removed criminal penalties for possessing up to 14g of marijuana, making it a finable offense instead. But he insisted it was NOT decriminalization because it is still illegal to possess weed. Likewise, New Jersey's ""decriminalization"" bill actually completely legalized possession of up to 6 ounces of pot for personal use.

linguistics,Does Norwegian sound similar to Russian?,"hello!! :)
tldr; I am just wondering if anyone else hears this weird connection or (purely aural) similarities between the two languages, despite them not being historically/developmentally related (to my knowledge).
Can any linguists help me out here lol

(Context:) I am a native English speaker, am weakly/semi-fluent in Russian after learning in college (and now listen to a lot of Russian music), and have (newer/added) family in Norway (and grew up hearing bits and pieces). All of that is to explain that I am not a native speaker of either language, but my ears are quite familar with hearing both :] I do not speak Norwegian, though, and have yet to attempt learning it.


Before learning Russian (and therefore getting aquainted with the sound of it), Norwegian just sounded like what an English speaker would expect to me--Germanic + Scandinavian, lilted, kinda sweet tbh. After learning Russian, I would be on video calls with my family, get distracted, hear them speaking, and my brain would go, this sounds like Russian??? and then a few seconds later it would go away. I've been hearing these sort of similarities right when I hear Norwegian ever since. Just now I was listening to a song (new to me) where the artist sings in English, then sings in Norwegian at the end and in trying to identify it, I thought it was Russian at first with the words, 
""Nummer en: pust
Aldri, aldri hold pusten
Nummer to: pust langsomt
Og dypt
Nummer tre: ikke mist pusten
Nummer fire: om et problem oppstår, stopp og senk angsten med langsom, dyp pust""

I was trying to find explanations, and the only brainstorming I have is: 
These lyrics/this passage sounded like it could be Russian (to me) up until ""langsomt,"" with the sort of swallowed ng vowel... and as the vowels started to be more open/elongated. 
Is it the way that you hit/place the consonants in your mouth (e.g. in ""pust"" and ""aldri"")? A lot of languages have rolled/flipped r's, and r's are definitely less emphasized/shorter in Norwegian, so it's not just that. Is it the way that some words are constructed that sounds so similar; do the consonant combinations reflect Russian more than some other languages do? Plus they both use a good amount of palatization, but my family is from southern Norway where they don't  even really do that?? 
Or do the smaller letter pairings/chunks in Norwegian that line up with patterns in common Russian words (I am no linguist, I am sure there are better terminologies/ways to explain these things...)?

There is obviously a significant lilt with pitch accents for Norwegian that is not present in Russian, but I feel like there is still some similarity there? Am I crazy lol. In Russian, the length and quality of the vowel matters more, but the pitch direction of a phrase can change the meaning entirely, so pitch does still matter... In my personal experience with Russian, I feel like words consistently have specific ways in which they roll off the tongue--in that there are specific stresses/an emphasized vowel in each word that shape how the rest of the word as well. I know that it's not the same as a pitch-accent, but is there any connection between where pitch-accents are placed in Norwegian words and stresses are placed in Russian? They just sound so damn similar in my ear sometimes, I don't understand.


So yeah... I tried to do some research on these languages' linguistic histories, but every where I looked, I could not find any connections. Norwegian is a Germanic language and uses a variation of the Roman alphabet, while Russian is a Slavic language and uses the Cyrillic alphabet... They're both Indo-European, but many other languages are as well, that do not sound so eerily alike to me! I tried to see if there were historical reasonings that would facilitate any aural relationship between them, or a relationship with word construction/stress shapings, or vowel/consonant patterns (again, there are better terms for these that I don't know eek!)... but I couldn't find anything. 
There was a pigeon language between the two that developed, but that was after they were both pretty established. Does the geographical proximity have anything to do with it? You would think that if proximity did in fact have any affect, it would be more evident in their earlier developments or anywhere at all... Gahhhhh. 

I guess this connection is more phonological and less historical, but how does that make sense???? Bruh. Am I crazy.


*Also for less important context, Russian and English are the only two languages I speak, but I watch a good amount of ""foreign"" films/shows and listen to music in different languages often too (e.g. Spanish, East-Asian languages, Hindi, Arabic, French?)... so my ear is, ~somewhat~ attuned to listening to languages I either don't know at all, or know very select words from (I hope this doesn't sound annoying, I just want to clarify that these two languages aren't the only two I hear LOL)
And for clarities sake, I don't often listen to/hear German, Portuguese, the many languages throughout Africa (I am so sorry!!! I very critically need to expand on that and appreciate these languages/cultures better off-paper eekk), Baltic or Balkan, Middle-Eastern  languages other than Arabic, other Germanic like Danish, Dutch, and extant languages, or Oceanic/South-East Asian languages. 
Sooo there are many tongues I am not at all familiar with hearing that could/do carry similarities to Russian, and could attune my ear differently if I was.

linguistics,Languages where vowelless sentences are possible,"So I’m trying to compile a list of languages in which (grammatically correct) sentences containing no vowels are possible. I’ve already found a few languages with a relatively high frequency of vowelless words (Nuxalk, Czech, Miyakoan, and Shilha) where a few can be formed (Czech actually has a bit of it a penchant for it), but I’m curious about more, and online most of what I can find are blog posts or forum discussions where people frankly have no clue what they’re talking about and bringing stuff up like the so-called “vowelless English words” *sky*, *rhythm*, etc. or similarly supposed “vowelless” words in Welsh where y and w are used to represent vowels.

To clarify exactly what I’m *not* interested in:

- nothing where “y” or “w” are used orthographically to represent vowels. These are still vowel phonemes, it doesn’t matter which letters you use to represent them. This is something I literally learned in elementary school; “y” and “w” can act as vowels in English (and many other languages). They don’t count. Same with epenthetic unwritten /ə/ inserted in consonant clusters, or other orthographic quirks like “v” being a vowel in Cherokee or Old Latin. Semi-vowel usage of /j/ or /w/ is fine so long as it is in fact those phonemes and there are no accessory true vowels. Know the difference.

- joke coinages and neologisms that basically no one uses don’t count as vowelless words

- on a similar note; I’m only interested in natural languages here. I love conlangs, but anyone can construct a language without any vowels at all, so I feel like that’d kind of be cheating here 

- on the topic of the epenthetic schwa thing above; I know there are some languages where whether or not one occurs between some consonants is debated and maybe dialectal. That’s fine, just nothing where it’s pretty much a universal feature of pronunciation like in the English *rhythm*

- No. Abjads. Yes, I’m well aware there are writing systems where vowels aren’t written, I did (briefly) learn Hebrew growing up. These do not count; once again, just because vowels aren’t written does not mean they aren’t there. Mentioning Hebrew as a supposed example of a “vowelless language” is probably the second most common bad answer to this question after Welsh

- probably barely worth mentioning, but sign languages, while technically languages without any vowels, or consonants, obviously aren’t what I’m looking for here

The biggest difference in our backgrounds is that she's spent most of the last 20 years living in France or Germany. 

Needless to say, this has affected her English in all the fun little ways (such as ""When will we see us again"" from the German usage of uns) that you come to expect of speaking a more international English. 

Usually we can agree on an affected moment, though there are time that I've been surprised to find an oddity left over from her growing up in Kansas, just as I've been learning ones from my childhood (apparently words like klootch and skookum are not common). This time, however, we've come to an impasse.

When describing an item or actions intent, she will say things to the effect of ""Well, it was thought for this purpose"" or ""I don't think that this is what the item was thought for.""

I'm at a loss, and we can't agree on where it comes from. It's not directly a German construction, and I'm not good enough at French to know the difference. Googling has produced no usage I can find.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

I want to improve my articulation, and I'm looking for well-established frameworks that I could apply when learning &amp; practicing how to properly communicate ideas.



Are there concepts/principles/theories which I could use when learning how to articulate? Here are some of my ideas, which may already have well-established principles out there:

1. Process of articulating (for example, step 1 is to formulate ideas, step 2 is to do this and that, and so on)

2. Patterns of expressing ideas (eg. expressing thoughts in a narrative format; or having an analytical approach of articulating an idea; or explaining an idea by being symbolic, etc.)

3. Dimensions/aspects of articulation (perhaps something like vocabulary, patterns of introducing an idea, order of ideas to present when speaking, etc.)

4. Considerations in articulating based on specific contexts (eg. how to appropriately deliver a message that is bad news for the receiver; or considering the relationship with the receiver in expressing your message, like your boss vs your friend; speaking in an informal setting vs delivering a speech)

5. Well-established rules on how to structure the words of a sentence / sentences of a paragraph in order to portray a specific feeling/meaning (eg. if you mention X before Y, the receiver would think/feel A; if you mention Y before X, the receiver would think/feel B; if you omit X and only express Y, the receiver would think/feel C)

6. Rules of communication in general (whether it be something technical in linguistics, or even something like eg. rules in building relationships through dialogue)




Do you know any well-established concepts (or maybe even articles) that may answer any of these things I have mentioned, or in some way could help explain the art of articulating ideas/feelings?

linguistics,Confusion regarding the Geordie accent's MOUTH and GOOSE vowels,"The modern Geordie accent is described as having a backed GOOSE vowel /u:/. The thing is, /u:/ is also described as being the traditional pronunciation of the MOUTH lexical set. The Modern Geordie accent now uses /aʊ/ for most words which once had /u:/, though there are exceptions where /u:/ is still used. Now this where my confusion begins. The northernmost accents of England, as well as the Scots language, never participated in the Great Vowel Shift of /u:/ to /aʊ/, but the GOOSE vowel itself was never raised to /u:/ but rather was fronted and raised to  /y:/ or /ʉ:/. Now this begs some questions:

1) Why does Geordie have a backed GOOSE vowel? Was the vowel once fronted but later backed? Or was it always backed? If it was always backed, (see the next question)

2) Does Geordie variably merge the MOUTH and GOOSE lexical sets? That is, can the words ""town"" and ""toon"" rhyme? Or is there some subtle difference between these vowels?

3) Is it possible that once Geordie adopted the /aʊ/ diphthong as a possible pronunciation in the MOUTH lexical set, that this caused them to completely abandon the traditional /y:/ GOOSE phoneme and instead transfer their traditional /u:/ of MOUTH to GOOSE? Which in turn would make the GOOSE lexical set use /u:/ exclusively, while MOUTH would vary between the introduced /aʊ/ phoneme and the traditional  /u:/.",1623449305,MasterLinguist,6,233,1359,63,9

Also, I'm not a native English speaker and I come from a third world country that's far away from the US.

I have already established what a language variety is, a dialect and accent but still, what I'm confused about now is what dialect to investigate because honest to God, I'm not sure if Standard American English has one unified dialect. I read that there's a Midland dialect, for instance. 
Moreover, Labov's studies are mostly focused on dialects in terms of pronunciation but since I'm not able to collect the data and analyze speech, my mentor told me to focus on syntax.

Then, I haven't been able to find a lot, if not any, literature about prestige linguistic forms in American dialects. I'm panicking because my deadline is approaching and I don't have the access to any database to retrieve the books related to anything similar to my topic. I also don't have any money to purchase books on google so all in all, I have 10 books about Sociolingusitics in general and a lot of articles about language and gender written from the femminist point of view.

Lastly, have any of you guys become friends with a North Korean or speak with them on a regular basis? What’s it like? Is it a little harder to hold a conversation?

Most sources I’ve come across distinguish between three possible realizations: /l/, /w/, and /ʎ/. This is all pretty clear. 

However, when listening to certain words supposedly pronounced with a light [l]-sound, I seem to be picking up on a dark [ɫ]-sound.

From what I’ve gathered the sound is commonly found in European Portuguese in word final position, but I can’t seem to find any evidence of it being present in the Brazilian spoken variety.

linguistics,Interesting Etymology of the Korean word chacihata (차지하다),"Hi! I'd like talk about a very extreme case of [spelling pronunciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelling_pronunciation) that happened in Korean.

In Korean, there is a very common verb 차지하다 *chacihata* that means ""to claim, to take up (space)"". Here are some example sentences (all romanization is done in Yale):

* 우리 반은 여학생이 80%를 **차지한다**. *wuli pan-un yehaksayng-i palsip pulwo-lul* **chaciha-n-ta**

  Our class-TOPIC female_student-NOM eighty percent-ACC **take_up**-PRES-DECL

  ""Female students take up 80% of our class.""

* 카이사르는 루비콘 강을 건너 정권을 **차지했다**. *khaisalu-nun lwupikhwon kang-ul kenn-e cengkwen-ul* **chaciha-yess-ta**

  Caesar-TOPIC Rubicon River-ACC cross-CONN power-ACC **seize**-PAST-DECL

  ""Caesar **seized** power by crossing the Rubicon River.""

This Modern Korean word *chacihata*, comes from the Middle Korean word *kozomalta* ""to deal with"". How in the world?

To understand this, you need to know how [Idu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idu_script) works. Idu is a writing system that was used to write Korean using Chinese Characters, until it slowly faded out of usage after the invention and proliferation of Hangul. In Idu, Koreans often used a certain Chinese character with a related meaning to represent a certain Korean word or a sound. If you know Japanese, this is very similar to kun'yomi, and it's called 석독(釋讀) *sektwok* (literally 'meaning-reading') in Korea. In other cases, Koreans used a Chinese character with a related pronunciation to represent a Korean word or a sound (音讀, *umtwok* ""sound-reading""), or a mix of the two systems, where the first part represents the meaning, and the second part represents the (partial) sound (末音添記法, *malumchemki'pep* ""final sound addition method""). I will focus on *sektwok* in this post.

For example, in Classical Chinese, the character 是 (pronounced /d͡ʑiᴇ/ in Middle Chinese, 시 *si* in Sino-Korean) meant ""this"". ""this"" in Korean is 이 *i*. So, 是 is used to represent the sound 이 *i* in Idu (*sektwok*). But also, 是 was used to represent the Korean sound *si* too (*umtwok*).

Then how do you write *kozomalta* in Idu?

First, you break the word apart: *kozomalta* is a compound that consists of two parts, *kozom* ""tool, material"" + *alta* ""to manage"".

Now, what's a Chinese character that has a meaning similar to *kozom* ""tool, material""? It's 資 (MC /t͡siɪ/, *co* in Sino-Korean) which means ""money, material"". However, the character 資 looks too complex, so let's just take the top part 次 (MC /t͡sʰiɪ/, Sino-Korean *cho*) and use that to write *kozom* instead. 次 has a meaning on its own, ""second"", but let's just ignore that.

What about *alta* ""to manage""? Actually, *alta* is a homophone: it can also mean ""to know"". The Chinese character for ""to know"" is 知 (MC /ʈiᴇ/, Sino-Korean *ti*). So let's use 知 to write *alta*.

So, combining the two characters above, we get 次知, which represents the Middle Korean word *kozomalta*.

As you can see from the discussion so far, writing a Korean word in Idu is not that difficult. However, *reading* it successfully back to the intended word is much more difficult to figure out! So, a lot of the time, people just read the Chinese characters using Sino-Korean pronunciation instead (*umtwok*), even though it was intended to be read using some other method (e.g. *sektwok* or *malumchemki'pep*).

Over time, as more and more people read 次知 as the Sino-Korean pronunciation *choti* instead of proper *sektwok* reading of *kozomalta*, the meaning shifted as well, from ""to deal with"" to ""to be in charge of"" to ""to claim"" and ""to take up (space)"". Also, historical sound changes made *choti* into *chaci* (vowel shift *o* &gt; *a*, palatization *ti* &gt; *ci*). Along with this, with a verb-making suffix -*hata*, it became the modern form *chacihata*.

The original form of the word, *kozomalta*, still survives in Modern Korean dictionaries as 가말다 *kamalta*, but its usage is extremely rare. (I was only able to find two occurences in any Modern Korean corpus.)",1623317160,mujjingun,41,629,4003,57,8

The article (as well as other resources on the internet like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashubian_alphabet)) transcribed these sounds as \[wɛ\] for ò and \[wʉ\] for ù.

linguistics,Reduplication of 'too',"Something I notice that I do without even thinking about, that I'm not aware where I got this from or who else does it, is the reduplication of 'too'.

As in ""I hope it's not *too* too crowded"" with a sort of stress placed on the first 'too'.

The way that I interpret this meaning, is that 'too too' is an excess of something in a situation where more excess is allowed than 'too'.

For example, If 1 is just the right amount and 10 is way too much, then 'too' is maybe a 3 and 'too too' is maybe a 7.

The difference between ""I hope it's not *too* too crowded"" and ""I hope it's not too crowded"" is that in the first sentence, I could tolerate a bit more of a crowd then in the second example.

Does anyone recognize this at all, does anyone else do this, and has there been any literature on the subject? (I did look it up but found nothing)

Edit: after thinking about it, I'd also do the same thing with 'that' and 'so' as in ""not *that* that bad"" or ""not *so* so common"" but I think these are less common.",1623277794,Strobro3,7,200,1010,22,3

Quite a few of theme are old, reconstructed phonologies. Is that just an artifact of the comparative method? Or are there some processes that allow to get rid the phonology of the hushing sounds?

linguistics,Are Homophones necessary?,"In most cases homophones are used in very different context. In this case I don't think they are necessary, you can use one word in different contexts and it makes sense. 

I personally verbally say their and there the same way, no distinguishes and doing this I never come into any problems. Where and were are different I pronounce them differently, but even if I said the same thing (making it a true homophone) they are completely different contexts, so using where or were in all cases would still make sense. The only cases homophones should be distinguished is in cases where context is the same such as I am fat, or I am phat, either case its confusing, one I am large the other I am muscular, saying it out loud is confusing. 

Tbh, in either case, the case where distinguishing is unnecessary (their and there), and distinguishing is necessary (phat and fat). In the first case distinguishing it is unnecessary context fixes the problem, so why make the distinction, in the other case distinguishing is necessary, but because they sound the same you verbally have to state the distinction, otherwise what your trying to convey could be wrong. So it just seems like homophones are completely broken, either you are writing unnecessary distinctions other than because that's how it is, or their needs to be a distinction, but verbally their isn't making it confusing.

TL:DR, when two different homophones are **only** used in **different** contexts, their is no need to distinguish the two, when homophones are **only** used in the **same** context, they should verbally be different and not homophones to begin with. Either case homophones are useless. 

So am I just being stupid, or are homophones actually useful?",1623258188,Skippers101,2,291,1726,25,3

linguistics,Art is strange in Sweden,"Please let me know if this question would work better in r/translator!

In Swedish it’s quite common to combine the words “konst” and “konstigt” (art and strange/weird) to play with the alliteration. It’s quite common that even museums or other institutions use these types of alliterations in their educational programs. For example: a children’s activity could be called “konst eller konstigt?” (art or weird?).

I’m wondering if this is common in other languages too. To describe art as something odd. Or is it just the fact that it’s an alliteration that has led to the consistent pairing of art and strange/weird in Sweden? If it is, I wonder how that affects how Swedish speakers think of art. Being trained from a young age to make the connection between konst (art) and konstigt (weird).

I think there is an etymological connection between both “konst” and “konstigt” as they seem to be derived from the German “Kunst”. However these days the words are completely separate in meaning.

As an art educator I guess I’m bothered by the habit of saying that art is weird! I guess the reason behind it is to open up for discussion and to acknowledge that art indeed can appear strange sometimes. But I worry that it mostly cements the idea that arts is something crazy.

I would happily accept suggestions on texts that could help me understand if there indeed a potential connection between the use of certain words and changes in how people behave.

linguistics,Is or has eastern Norwegian shifted closer to East NGmc?,"The traditional divide between East NGmc (Swedish and Danish) and West NGmc (Icelandic, Faroese) I feel accounts fairly well for some of the main structural differences these two zones have, but I feel like at least eastern Norwegian, exemplified by Austland dialects and bokmål, is in many ways closer to East NGmc than West. The features that currently come to mind:

* strong and 1st weak presents merged with 2nd/3rd weak presents (bm. *jeg kommer, jeg ligger* sv. *jag kommer, jag ligger* VS is. *ég kem, ég ligg* nn. *eg kjem, eg ligg*)
* partial monophthongisation (bm. sv. *ben, øst/öst* VS is. nn. *bein, aust*), with numerous exceptions (da. sv. *ø/ö* VS bm. nn. *øy* is. *eyja*)
* geminate depalatalisation (sv. *ligga* bm *ligge* VS is. nn. *liggja* (+ variants))

There are of course things that e.g. bokmål doesn't do that ENGmc does (such as unmarked possessive constructions of the type PRON + INDEF as opposed to DEF + PRON), and some that nynorsk shares with Danish that Swedish and bokmål don't do (nn. *born* da. *børn* is. *börn* VS sv. bm. *barn*); but this all paints me a confusing picture.

linguistics,Does English have less of a written-spoken difference than other languages with long literary traditions?,"Even ignoring extreme cases like Tamil or Arabic, where the formal variety has not been spoken colloquially since the Middle Ages, it seems like English has less fundamental (i.e. non-lexical) differences between its spoken and written forms than many other languages:

* Many languages have various conjugations nowadays largely reserved to the written form: French simple past, Persian future, Welsh verbal morphology, Korean *hada* forms. There is nothing like this in English.
* Many languages have etymologically unrelated literary and spoken words for terms as basic as the prepositions ""in"" (Persian *dar* vs. *tu*) and ""to"" (Korean *ege* vs. *hante*), the conjunction ""and"" (Burmese *hníñ* vs. *né*), or the pronoun ""we"" (French *nous* vs. *on*). I can't think of anything like this in English.

And this isn't just an issue of formality, even children's books are often written in this literary grammar that nobody speaks in normally.

Apparently this is due to de-emphasis of ṣ in a manner similar to [Geers' law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geers%27_law) for Akkadian, but it seemed strange to me that it would become ś ([ɬ] in Ancient Hebrew) and not plain s. Unless. Some time ago, I read that Arabic ض, proto-Semitic ḍ, was likely originally pronounced [ɮˤ]. I also know that Hebrew letters ח and ע had double pronunciations in ancient Hebrew preserving different proto-Semitic consonants, so it made me think - maybe צ had two pronunciations as well? If צ in צחוק was actually pronounced [ɮˤ], it de-emphasizing and then devoicing to become [ɬ], the closest counterpart to [ɮ], seems to be much more likely than [sˤ] randomly becoming lateral [ɬ] instead of just staying at plain [s]. So צ seems to have had two pronunciations, the well known [sˤ] but also [ɮˤ].

I'm really not an expert on this, and I guess it depends whether you reconstruct  ancient Hebrew ṣ as pharyngealized, ejective or affricate, but this double pronunciation theory seems to me to make a lot of sense. It's just one word though, and I can't find another example of ṣ becoming ś. Also, the version of the word with ś  appears mostly in the later books of Proverbs, Job and Ecclesiastes so perhaps by that time ś had merged into s.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1623063613,AutoModerator,278,479,2762,96,17

linguistics,Designed languages for nation and identity building purposes vs more or less naturally evolved and standardised languages,"Modern Turkish and Hebrew are newly created languages (designed languages so to speak) on an older language basis, Ottoman Turkish, and Classical Hebrew respectively, to the point that mutual intelligibility between the two modern languages and their predecessors, respectively, is very hard if not impossible. Often this phenomenon of ""creating a new language"" so to speak, follows the creation of a nation/state or its reformation. Modern Hebrew and modern Turkish exist because of nation creating efforts, otherwise Turks would continue to speak Ottoman Turkish (or spoken varieties; Ottoman Turkish apparently had 88% of its vocabulary borrowed from Arabic and Persian, today's language is full of neologisms when these foreign words were replaced) , and Jews would continue to read Classical Hebrew and speak Yiddish, Ladino and many other languages.

I contrast this phenomenon with the more common one, where a certain dialect or variant will become the basis for the standard language during a unification or becoming a nation state (e.g. the Fiorentine dialect in Italian or High German variety as the basis for standard German, or the way Macedonian emerged from South Slavic (arguably Bulgarian) varieties). (I'm not sure where to classify Greek in this respect, is modern Greek a newly designed language or a natural continuation of a spoken variety?)

What is this phenomenon of creating a new language for nation building purposes called? I mean not the standardisation, but the design language phenomenon. What are the factors for it to succeed?

linguistics,Better way to order english alphabet,"i propose a better way to order english alphabet, becos the original dont make sense. this ordering method can be generalised to order other langs' alphabet, and even IPA too.

rules for ordering letters:

1. vowels &gt; consonants

vowel order:

1. open vowels &gt; close vowels
2. front vowels &gt; back
3. unrounded &gt; round

(ie left to right, bottom to top on ipa vowel chart)

conso order:

1. conso articulation place front &gt; back
2. conso manner sonority low &gt; high (aspirated&gt;tenuis&gt;voiced, stop&gt;affricate&gt;fricative&gt;nasal&gt;approximant), then central&gt;lateral within the same manner
3. if a letter is pronounced differently from ipa, use the pronunciation in the language
4. if a letter can have &gt;1 sound, use the prototypical one (/ɡ/ for g, /ks/ for x)
5. if a letter is pronounced as a sequence of sound, put letter after the monoarticulated ones with the 1st sound of that sequence (/ks/ for x, and put it after all the k-like sounds and before g)
6. coarticulated sound letters treated similarly, but put any 2ndary and further articulations after the monoarticulated version (ie w after ɰ if language have both)
7. if multiple letters share the same sound, sort by their ipa pronunciation, but keep them grouped together insted of moving to new position

linguistics,Linguistic prescriptivism and non-native speakers?,"I live in a community where English is the lingua franca. There are frequently situations where people say things that would probably sound like a mistake to native English speakers, such as saying “borrow” when they mean “lend”, and vice versa. Most of the time the meaning still comes across, thanks to relevant contexts.

I got curious so I started reading around on this subject. One of the articles frequently mentioned is [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/\~myl/languagelog/archives/003588.html](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003588.html). Based on what written there, if someone insists that people in my community use the words “lend” and “borrow” as explained in dictionaries, that would be considered inappropriate prescriptivism, as the meaning of the sentences are still clearly understood, so there’s no loss in useful distinction, and furthermore there’s no intentional twisting of words to promote some agenda. On the other hand, I’m hesitant to say this is a natural linguistic change, but rather an error on the part of the speakers when learning English: most of them, when explained what’s funny about the situation, realize that they’ve associated “lend” and “borrow” with the opposite words, respectively, in their own languages.

I find it interesting to think of this in comparison to an example in English: “I’m down for a game tonight” and “I’m up for a game tonight” both mean the same thing. Yet I can’t say for sure that the two situations are entirely similar, or even comparable.

French is supposedly an easyy easy language for Germanic speakers (Dutch, Swedish, english) but when I had to practise French I hated it because there are so many things you have to "" bruteforce""  into your brain that have no logical reasoning behind them. Like female words vs male words, grammar which has tonnes of exceptions.

While Japanese was modernized in 1900. The way you write it is exactly how youre going to pronounce it, there are no "" silent ""  characters or exceptions, it is a logical system. 

The Kanji will be difficult yes, but even those all have a logical reasoning. Theyre basically stylized pictogramsand if you understand the radicals you can get a good sense of what they mean even if you havent seen them before.


In general thisi s something I find with Japanese, it is all, very logical with only a few exceptions that you need to memorize and most of those also have a logical reasoning behind why they are exceptions. In my native language, and French, logical reasoning is only minor part of why things are written a certain way and tradition is more important.

I noticed that when certain vowels occur next to some other ones, there are some shifts that happen. Let me given an example:

The word kēvalam(disgusting, ugly) is pronounced **[kæːʋʌlɔ̃]** by me. I'm not sure which dialect this usually happens to, but I feel like it's most modern dialects. Here's what I observed:

e -&gt; æ, o -&gt; ɔ (with lengths preserved) when they occur next to *a* (ə/ʌ) ā**, *e ē*, *o ō*.

This is really clear when we take conjugated forms of some works, for example

* kēḷu [keːɭɯ] (imperative of ""to ask"") and kēkkata [kæːkːaːdʌ] (""don't ask"") and kēlēn [kæːlɛ̃(ː)] (""please ask"")
* nēru [neːɾɯ] (straight, noun) and nērā(ka) [næːɾaː] (straightly, adverb)
* sollu [solːɯ] (""say"", imperative) and sollāta [sɔlːaːtʌ] (""don't say"")
* pēru [peːɾɯ] (name) and pēran [pæːɾʌ̃] (grandson)

linguistics,A question on Language Attrition,"First post here. 

My father told me that he used to speak Teochew Ue (Chaozhou hua) to grandma. However, now that grandma has passed away for 10+ years, he said his Teochew has deteriorated so much that he can only understand the language if it's spoken slowly to him, and he can no longer speak fluent Teochew anymore. At most it's a few simple phrases/words etc. 


Is there any theory/model to explain this language atrophy? Shouldn't speakers be able to retain their mother languages even though they might not have spoken it in decades? And for fellow redditors in this sub, do you recognise this sort of language shift/attrition when you move to a completely differently linguistic environment? 

This might be more of a cultural thing than linguistics thing, so mods if you think this is not for this sub please tell me right away.

linguistics,Multilingual confused,"Hey! 

Could you help me understand this one thing I started confusing over, while I was working on my CV and trying to fill in the language skills section. 

So I grew up multilingual:  

my parents spoke language A to me 

I was watching TV from the age 3 in language B, picked it up from that age. 

and living in a country and went to kindergarten +school in language C 

 
So how would I put these on me CV? Are all three of them my mother tongue? I'm so confused. I'm quite fluent in all of them, but I'd say language A is the weakest. 

Is mother tongue the language you acquire first? What about the early (age 3) simultaneous exposure of the additional language B and C? Which are also stronger than the first one I acquired. It feels weird to put language A as mother tongue level , because it is then assumed to be the strongest language..when truth is B and C are actually better.

Now, what I realized is that the medium category was the only one with a lot of uncommon words of Germanic origin (or, in general, not derived from Latin). Since I can speak two romance languages (Italian and French) and I studied Latin in high school, I was able to guess the meaning of a lot of vocabulary from the other two categories. For instance, it is much easier for me to guess the meaning of the word ""lachrymose"" than that of the word ""clad"".

Does anybody know of a list of not-so-common English lexicon with Germanic roots or any other resources that could help me with this? I couldn't find anything of the sort on Google.

It's a Germanic language derivative, related to Old High German and Old Norse. But why use Afrikaans as a nexus to the Nordic mindset, when the language would appear so watered down over time? Why not have chosen earlier Dutch, OHG or even ON itself? The answer is because that's been done already and also because the author is South African.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1622458822,AutoModerator,196,479,2762,95,17

I'm really interested in hearing other people's thoughts on this article. :)
In the introduction, Sampson states:
I believe that the concept of “ungrammatical” or “ill-formed” word-sequences is a delusion, based on a false conception of the kind of thing a human language is. 
The remainder of the article explains his understanding of the concept of Grammaticality, and provides both theoretical and empirical arguments against it.
I'm especially curious as to what people working in the Generative tradition think about this article. Is it's understanding of the typical Generative approach to Grammaticality accurate?

linguistics,"One of the theories about Etruscan proposes that it may be related to the Pre-Greek substrate: multiple linguistic features are shared by the 2 languages, but nowadays an autochthonous origin of the Etruscans is considered more probable than an Aegean origin. So is this theory still possible?","This may be a long post, sorry for that, a **TLDR is that most archeological and genetic evidence goes against this theory, while linguistic evidence (might) be in favor of it.**   
*I also included a summary of this post towards the end. The word list occupies a lot of space in this post, so don't worry, it's not as long as it looks; you can simply read the compared words without the explanations.*

I'll list the evidence against and in favor of this theory.

**EVIDENCE AGAINST THE THEORY**

The 2 main theories about the origin of the Etruscans propose that:

1. they were either autochthonous to Italy (possibly a continuation of the Proto-Villanovan culture);
2. hey had migrated from the Aegean sea, as claimed by two Greek historians: Herodotus, who described them as a group of immigrants from Lydia in Anatolia, and Hellanicus of Lesbos who claimed that the Tyrrhenians were the Pelasgians *(pre-greeks, considered the speakers of the Pre-Greek substrate language)* originally from Thessaly, Greece, who entered Italy at the head of the Adriatic sea.

Archeological and genetic research seems to point towards the first theory. I quote from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_origins):

&gt;According to modern scholars, and specifically etruscologists, all the evidence gathered so far points to an indigenous origin of the Etruscans. Moreover, there is no archeological evidence for a migration of the Lydians or the Pelasgians into Etruria. The earliest evidence of a culture that is identifiably Etruscan dates from about 900 BC: this is the period of the Iron Age Villanovan culture, considered to be the earliest phase of Etruscan civilization, which itself developed from the previous late Bronze Age Proto-Villanovan culture in the same region.

I feel that the [Italian article](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipotesi_sull%27origine_degli_Etruschi) is more complete, and offers more sources (especially regarding genetic research). Genetic analysis on Etruscan samples shows that there is **very little genetic difference between Etruscans and Latins (or, more generally, Indo-Europeans), but for some reason, the Etruscans maintained a Pre-Indo-European language.** The same situation is found with the Basque: they are genetically close to the 'Steppe peoples', but at the same time they're one of the few non-Indo-European speakers of Europe. This probably means that (in both cases) the IndoEuropean immigrating population mixed with the previous pre-IE population who lived in those lands during the Neolithic, and the pre-IE language was kept rather than the IE language.

This genetic and archeological evidence is the biggest evidence *against* the theory that Etruscan is related to Pre-Greek [(the non-Indo-European language spoken in Greece before Indo-Europeans arrived, which left many loanwords in the Greek language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Greek_substrate).

**EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF THE THEORY**

**SUFFIXES**

The previously mentioned evidence would point against the theory, but there are elements in favor of this theory too, like the following 4 suffixes:

* **the suffix** ***-nn-*** is found very often in both Etruscan and Pre-Greek, but never/almost never in Indo-European. For example, the ethnonym of Etruscans (their autonym at least) is '*Rasenna*', and many Etr. family names such as *Spurinna* have this suffix too. Pre-Greek examples are ἀγάννα, βλέννος, γίννος, λαχάννα, Δίκτυννα...
* **the suffix** ***-nt-*** is found very often in both Etruscan and Pre-Greek, but never/almost never in Indo-European. For example, the Roman family name '*Antonius*', which was of Etruscan origin. Pre-Greek examples are ἀσκάνθης, ὀκρίβας; φάλανθ/τος, Ἄβαντες, Μέλανθ/τ-, Πείρανθ/τ-, Γίγαντε, Κορύβαντες...
* **the suffix** ***-mn-*** is found very often in both Etruscan and Pre-Greek, and sometimes in Indo-European too. One of the major Etruscan deities, *Voltumna*, contained *-mn-*. Pre-Greek examples are ϝεδιμνος, ἴαμνος, βασυμνιάτης, κρημνός, λάμνα, λωρυμνόν, μέριμνα, ῥόδαμνος, σίγυμνον, σίδριμνον...
* **the suffix** ***-rn-*** is found very often in both Etruscan and Pre-Greek, but never/almost never in Indo-European. Robert Beekes considers it one of the major similarities between Etruscan and Pre-Greek. Etruscan examples are *Turnu*, *parniχ*, *marniu*; Pre-Greek examples are ἀκαρνάν (ἀκάρναξ), κυβερνάω, λιπερνέω (also λιφ-), σκέπαρνος...

*(The Pre-Greek words were all left in their Greek forms since we do not have direct attestation of Pre-Greek. I sometimes removed the Greek nominative endings when romanizing, since they are Indo-European).*

* The first 4 words are 'basic' terms, which makes it unlikely to imagine that they were loanwords.
* Welkhans *may* be a loanword - but the Minoans were never in contact with the Etruscans since the 2 civilizations lived in different periods.
* The 6th and 7th terms, *aska* and *ampile*, might be loanwords. The Greek words themselves are of Pre-Greek origin. It is very interesting to see that *aska* and ἀσκός match with Minoan *aka*.
* The 8th example, *mata(m)*, cannot be a loanword; the etymology of Greek μετά is unclear, so the 2 words either both have the same origin, or it is a (statistically rare) coincidence.
* The 9th example, *mutana*, is in my opinion one of the 'best' examples: it is not a loanword, it probably comes from the same root, and the 2 words have somewhat different meanings which are connected (which often happens with cognates).
* *tamna*, 'horse', is in my opinion another good example: it is probably not a loanword, it probably comes from the same root, and the 2 words have different - but related - meanings.
* *thap*, 'to consume', might be another good example: it is not a loanword, it probably comes from the same root, and the 2 words have different - but related - meanings. The only doubt here is whether the root is Indo-European or Pre-Greek: some etymologists say that δάπτω is IE, while others say it has a Pre-Greek origin, especially if it should be related to δεῖπνον (deîpnon, “meal”)
* The same goes for *themiasa*: probably not a loanword, may come from the same root, different but related meanings; some etymologists say θέμις is Pre-Greek, others say it is IE.
* *truna* and *turan* might be great examples: they are probably not loanwords, they probably come from the same root, the words have different but related meanings, and there is also a correspondence with (Pre-)Greek τύραννος: it may mean both 'ruler' and 'lady'. (A possible, but not necessarily relevant, observation: Pre-IE Europe/Balkans has been hypothesized to be a more women-centric society than the following IE societies; perhaps 'lady/princess' and 'ruler' weren't 2 terms as unrelated as they became in the following centuries).
* The 14th example, *arac*, may point to either ἱέραξ 'eagle' (but this word is more probably IE than Pre-Greek) or οὖραξ (the /o/ in Greek words from Pre-Greek was originally an /a/, and *-ουρ-* was originally /arʷ/ in Pre-Greek, so: *οὖραξ* &lt; \*arwak-)
* The 15th example, *eitua*, has also variants with *a-*; compare *aitua - aidoia* (P.G. form would be *aiduja*)
* The 16th example, *elaiwana*, seems a basic term that would difficultly be a loanword from Greek. Other IE languages had the same root, such as Old Armenian *ewł* 'oil', which points to (I cite) 'a borrowing from a Mediterranean Pre-Greek source'. Also compare ἐλαία from earlier *elaíwā*, 'olive'.
* The 17th example, *leth-*, also seems a term which would difficultly be a loanword from Greek, both because it is not identical/very similar to the Greek form (differently from other direct loanwords) and because of its meaning (most loanwords refer to physical/real things, not to abstract concepts).
* The 18th example, *littera*, is either a loanword from Greek, or it is a cognate with Pre-Greek. In both cases, the word is of Pre-Greek origin. I personally think it is a cognate rather than a loanword, because it shows the 'D/L' alternation, a distinct feature of Pre-Greek words which often gives forms which vary between D and L (example: Ὀδυσσεύς / Οὐλιξεύς -- Odysseus/Oulikseus); Beekes explains this variation as possibly pointing to /tɬ/ in Pre-Greek (e.g. *Utlukjeu*). If it is a cognate, the meaning couldn't originally be 'leather as writing material', but simply 'piece of leather', like it was originally in Greek too.
* The 19th example *maluwe* is, like the previous word, either a loanword from greek or a cognate with Pre-Greek. The word is of Pre-Greek origin, and Beekes reconstructs it as \*malwak-.
* The 20th example, *netsus*, might be a loanword, but the fact that it doesn't have the same meaning as the Greek word, but rather a related meaning, means it may be a cognate instead.
* The 21st example, *pulunza*, might be a loanword, but the fact that it doesn't have the same meaning as the Greek word, but rather a related meaning, means it may have the same origin.
* The same goes for the 22nd example, *sime*.
* The Greek form of *arim*, 'monkey', is a rare word, mentioned by [Hesychius of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesychius_of_Alexandria).
* The Greek word ἄπα, 'father', wasn't common either, but it [is](https://lsj.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%84%CF%80%CE%B1) recorded
* The 25th example, *cera*, might be loanwords from Greek, but the words come from the Pre-Greek substrate. Latin *cera* was taken from Etruscan, not Greek, so perhaps it has a substrate origin in both Greek and Etruscan, rather than being a loanword.
* The 26th example, *lithra*, is undisputedly considered of (pre-IE) Mediterranean substrate origin; the question is whether the Etruscan word comes from Greek/Latin, or from Pre-Greek (as a cognate).
* The 27th example, *morma*, might be a loanword.
* *tupi* and τυπή are probably cognates, but we don't know if they come from PIE or from Pre-Greek.
* *tur* and θύος are probably cognates, but we don't know if they come from PIE or from Pre-Greek.
* *tul* and *calanice* are weak examples; I included *tul* because of the related meaning (Etr. 'border', Gr. an island at the border of the world), and because the origin of Gr. Θούλη is unexplained (and in these cases the origin is likely to be Pre-Greek)
* κάμπτρα/κάμψα/κάψα are of Pre-Greek origin, so *capra* is either a cognate or a loanword.
* *apu/afu* points more to a cognate with ἅπτω than a loanword because of the variation in meaning.
* The last example is definitely a much 'weaker' link, which I decided to include because the 'Etruscan version' (= the version of the word if adapted to Etruscan phonology) of Gortun is, in fact, Curtun (there was no /g/ in Etruscan, so it would become /k/; there was no /o/ in Etruscan either, and it became /u/, eg. *Ruma* for Roma). It may be relevant if the 'migration theory' was correct.

Another possible common feature is the genitive/ablative of origin suffix:

* ***-akh*** in Etruscan (or ***-akj*** if it was palatalized, see paragraph on palatalization later)
* **-ak-** in Pre-Greek: many Pre-Greek words end in -akos, -akē, -aks, etc. which is **-ak-** when you remove the nominative ending; καυν**άκ**η, θῡλ**άκ**η, πιστ**άκ**η, φάρμ**ακ**ον, βατι**άκ**η...

We mustn't forget something: **we only know a few hundred Etruscan words, some of them even being IE-loanwords, and around 1000 Pre-Greek words. Not only do we have a relatively small word list, which makes it harder to find possible cognates; for many of these words (the vast majority of them) we only have the form in one of the 2 languages, not both.** For example, we know that 'daughter' was sec in Etruscan, but we don't know the Pre-Greek word for 'daughter'.

**PHONOLOGY**

Here are the phonetic inventories of the 2 languages:

||ETRUSCAN|PRE-GREEK|
|:-|:-|:-|
|STOPS|p pʰ   t̪ t̪ʰ   k kʰ|p pʲ pʷ ᵐp   t̪ t̪ʲ t̪ʷ ⁿt̪   k kʲ kʷ ᵑk|

|LIQUIDS|l̪   r̪|l̪ l̪ʲ l̪ʷ   r̪ r̪ʲ r̪ʷ|
|VOWELS|ɑ  e  i  u|a  (e)  i  (o)  u|

\[My source for the Pre-Greek phonology is [Robert Beekes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_S._P._Beekes)' *Pre-Greek Phonology, Morphology, Lexicon*.\]

Note: the consonants in brackets, ʧ, xʷ, and tɬ, have been proposed but are either not accepted by the majority of experts (ʧ , xʷ) or only hypothesized briefly (tɬ)./ɸ/ is the only phoneme which included in the table which wasn't included in Beekes' work - it is my personal take on the alternation between /w/ , /m/ , and labial stops in certain Pre-Greek words (my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt though, since I am not a linguist). The Pre-Greek /e/ and /o/ are found in brackets because they were an allophone of /a/ when adjacent to palatalized consonants and labialized consonants, respectively. Beekes also wrote that probably not *all* of the labial/palatal versions of the consonants he lists were found in pre-Greek, since some of them are very rare in the world's languages.

The most obvious difference between the 2 inventories is, rather than the actual 'plain' phones (which are almost identical), that Etruscan has aspirated stops, while Pre-Greek has palatalized and labialized versions of both stops and resonant. This doesn't really have much importance in determining whether these 2 languages are related or not (take for example the IE family, which has languages with palatalized/labialized/aspirated consonants, and others with none of these variations), but it is worth mentioning that - according to some linguists specialized in Etruscan such as Helmut Rix and Mauro Cristofani - the language included /lʲ, rʲ, nʲ/, and the aspirated stops \[pʰ t̪ʰ kʰ\] were actually palatalized stops \[pʲ t̪ʲ kʲ\]. If this is true, it would make the languages more similar (although as I mentioned before these features aren't really useful to determine a possible relation between the two).

Some possible evidence for the theory about palatalized consonants:

* variant spellings such as amφare/amφiare, larθal/larθial, aranθ/aranθiia
* the city of Velχ was *Vulci in* Latin; \[wəlkʲ\] &gt; \[wulki\] seems more likely to me than \[wəlkʰ\] &gt; \[wulki\]

Another important similarity is that both languages don't have voiced-voiceless distinction.

**TO SUM UP**

* Genetic evidence points to an autochthonous or Central European origin of the Etruscans
* Archeological evidence also points to an autochthonous origin
* Etruscans had Indo-European genes, but they spoke a non-Indo-European language
* This language has some resemblance to the Pre-Greek, non-IE, language spoken in Greece (and possibly other areas such as the southern Balkans and/or Western Anatolia) during the Neolithic
* Some common (and non-loanword) lexicon
* A similar phonology
* Common suffixes not found in Indo-European, but often found in Etruscan and Pre-Greek (!)

**The question is: if the Etruscans were autochthonous to Central Europe (and then Italy), but they did, in fact, speak a language related to that spoken in the Aegean, how did this language arrive in Italy?**

My personal theory: the Neolithic population of Central Italy, which inhabited the region previous to the arrival of Indo-Europeans, Proto-Italics in this case (second half of the 2nd Millenium BC), had arrived in Italy during the Neolithic migrations (like the Neolithic inhabitants of Greece) and spoke a language related to Pre-Greek. The part about migrations is not my theory, it is [considered a fact (Cardium pottery migrations)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardium_pottery), while the part about the language is a 'logical' conclusion. When the Indo-Europeans arrived in Central Italy, some of them mixed with the Neolithic inhabitants of the region, and the Pre-IE language was maintained. This would be a similar situation to that which happened with the Basque, where the Pre-IE language was kept too, despite mixing with Indo-Europeans. Etruscan also contains many words of Indo-European etymology (even putting loanwords from Latin and Greek aside, words like *lautun*, 'people' &lt; PIE *hlewdʰ-*, 'people'), which may be explained if we assume that many words used by the immigrating IE speakers entered the Etruscan language when the pre-IE and IE peoples mixed. Alternatively, we know that the Villanovan culture originated from central European [Urnfield culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urnfield_culture) system; the latter is considered to be an IE-speaking culture, but nothing excludes that it may have included some pre-IE speakers from the Balkans. These speakers settled in Central Italy, then becoming the Etruscans.

Of course, **we don't know enough about Etruscan and Pre-Greek to** ***establish*** **if they are related or not,** all we can do is have theories.

&gt; In an account passed down by the *Fihrist*, Ibn al-Muqaffa'
 describes the linguistic situation in Iran at the end of the Sasanian period. The Iranians, he says in effect, have five languages: *pahlavi*, the language of the Fahla country, that is to say of ancient Media, the Jibal of the Muslims; *dari*, the language of the capital (Ctesiphon or Mada'in); *parsi*, language of the *mobad*s and scholars; *suryani*, spoken in Sawad; and
*khuzi*, used in Khuzistan. Of these five languages two are not Iranian in the sense accepted by linguists; *suryani* is Aramaic, at that time the common language of the population of Mesopotamia, while *khuzi* was probably a relic of the ancient Elamite.

I am a french computational linguist working in a political social sciences lab in Paris and first, I want to thank you all for being a great community.

Now my question might be dumb, but I've been wandering : is there anything else than a phonetic similarity problem in the difficulty to differentiate between then and than in native american english speaker written text ?

The fact that one is a temporal link and the other a comparaison strikes me as a huge functional difference that should prohibit mixing up. Is there something on the semantic level that I am missing ? 

Another example is ""I could OF made this clearer"". Same problem. I feel like the phonetic level is suddenly taking over, and the syntaxic-semantic level plays no role where it should. Or is it just that nobody cares already ? 

I am aware of the level of deprivation of certain segments of the population in terms of basic education.

linguistics,Eradicating English's last traces of grammatical gender through activist style guides,"Hello /r/linguistics. Recently I have read a lot about the history of ""they"" as a pronoun, and how it has been used since the 14th century to refer to people of known or unknown gender.

What sparked my interest specifically was the history of how grammarians treated the use of pronouns. Up until very recently, most style guides have completely rejected singular they, favouring a ""generic he"" or sentence re-formulation. Today the tables have turned. As women entered the workforce and an ideological shift toward gender equality occured, the field of linguistics underwent a change too. Grammarians became activists instead of historians, and suddenly the use of ""he"" to refer to someone who is not immediately obvious to be male was considered wrong. The same has happened to the terms spokesman, layman, and everyman, three terms which are wrong according.

While English has completely lost its grammatical gender and gendered inflections, many ""agent nouns"" retained their previous pronoun usage. ""Person"" is one of these. I have been corrected several times on my English essays for my use of ""generic he"", where a ""they"" is considered the correct alternative by ideologically motivated style guides. This despite ""he"" being what I would say or write naturally. Why is that? Enter a time machine and ask all my distant ancestors why they were not consistent with agent nouns. 

I feel pretty safe in claiming that the average English speaker uses a mixture of singular they and generic he in their language. I cannot speak for everyone, but I often use ""they"" when referring to an undetermined person, and ""he"" when referring to a specific person. Compare ""ask someone if they'd like a cookie"" to ""he's low HP, kill him"".

Generic he is part of my (and many others') natural spoken/written language, and hilarity ensues when I see people on the self-proclaimed online descriptivist flagship doing a conscious effort to alter their language to make it more ""correct"" or rather ""progressive"". The use of words like ""spokesperson"" and ""humankind"" have a very recent history, in fact almost correlating with the activist push for degenderization.

 It is very apparent that there Frankenstein words have had their etymologies be engineered, not spring from the spoken language. Singular they is obviously not something a blue-haired bespectacled feminist came up with, but precribed use of it is ridiculous. I was stunned when I was *corrected* for referring a redditor of unknown gender as ""he"" HERE. CORRECTED!

Why is singular they considered by so many to be ""incorrect"", despite it being part of so many people's natural language? In my view, ""they"" and ""he"" are in many cases practically synonyms, and consistent use of one of them should not be prescribed, as practically no one chooses one consistently in their natural language.",1622216213,infractionhook,5,465,3350,85,11

linguistics,Double question: Australian English and Canadian English,"Hey lingos, I wondered if you could help me with just clearing up two phonemes/certain pronunciations withing Australian English and Canadian English

I've wondered about the /au/ sound in CE, in words like ""about"" and ""out"", where I know some Americans like to make fun of it pronounce it ""aboot"" or /ə'but/ or something like that, but I know that's not correct. But I can really place my finger on how exactly it's pronounced, and it's so far the only way I as a non-native English speaker can distinguish between (General) American English and Canadian English.

Is it like /ə'bɛut/? Or is it different?

The second one is the ""r-like"" sound that AE has at the end of some words like ""no""/""know"" and ""so"". I have no idea how I would transcribe that to IPA, what phoneme is that?? It's very unique in my ears, it's almost rhotic-like, but not really, but I've no idea what it is. Is it a vowel with one of those additional accents? Is it a consonant?

The case that stands out to me is Turkish. It originally used the Arabic script for over 1,000 years but then switched to the Latin alphabet because the Latin script was better suited to the language \[1\]. 

This makes me wonder, does the Latin alphabet stand out among writing systems as better able to represent languages that didn't develop with it?

linguistics,"As an American, I have noticed that people in the UK have a completely different attitude towards the N word. What’s your opinion on the matter?","My experience in the US and Canada with the N word is radically different than with other peoples experiences of the word in other countries. The more I talk to UK citizens, the more I see that there is a completely different attitude towards the word. In my part of the world, the N word is casually used in general conversations among so many different types of people. Over here, people see the word in less negative light than our UK counterparts. People over here differentiate between the word that ends in A and the one that ends in ER. Like the Spanish word from which it originates, people see that different variations can take on different meanings. I think that people in the US started to use the word in a way that stripped power from its previous meaning. This of course is not universal amongst all Americans. However, younger generations have reinvented the word and use it more liberally. Where I’m from, it doesn’t matter what race you are. Everyone uses the word with each other without second thought. Like I said though, this isn’t necessarily the norm with everyone but more-so younger people. That’s not to say that it is exclusively a generational thing though. 

When I talk to people in the UK though, I’d be hard pressed to find individuals that share the same mentality and sentiment towards the word. Over there it takes on a more negative connotation where people associate the word with racism and slave ownership. They use the word thats ends in A interchangeably with the one that ends in ER. I even read an article once where someone had the misconception that people use the word that ends in ER as a word meaning friend. The general attitude, thats I’ve encountered, over in the UK is that it is racist and only blacks can use it. Obviously this is all anecdotal. Seeing how this is a big world with a lot of people, I was curious as to what others experiences are with this word. What’s your opinion on the N word?",1621976505,JohnDoeIsMoe,6,351,1952,144,26

linguistics,"I have a question about the use of gender-neutral pronouns ""they/their/them"" when referring to non-binary people in English","English isn't my first language and in my native tongue Portuguese we don't have normative gender-neutral pronouns widely used by people in normative and/or informal discourse when referring to non-binary people.

Most of the texts written in Portuguese use either masculine or feminine  pronouns in its argumentative structure and when referring to  people/objects/animals, where some linguistic rules applied to the termination of the words are taken by the speakers when they define a given word as masculine or feminine.

That is, the speakers define the word's gender and not the person's. Even so, it is common to people extend the understanding of the word's gender to the person's gender too. This is why a lot of people are pushing  political agendas in order to create gender-neutral pronouns in a romance and very gendered language like Portuguese -- which I believe  it's also happening in other romance languages too.

On the other hand, we actually have some gender-neutral words in Portuguese, like *presidente*, which means *president* in English. Despite that, many Brazilian presidents were male and when people usually hear such a word, they understand not only the word but  also the person associated to it as male.

In  English, I believe, when native speakers hear a word like ""secretary"" they can't define the gender. The equivalent, in Portuguese, would be *secretári****a*** to a female secretary and *secretári****o*** to a male secretary, with *secretári****os*** referring to the plural of both male and female secretaries, and *secretári****as*** only indicating female secretaries.

Although I have read a lot of English textbooks on several subjects since I  started studying the language, I've been exposed to gender-neutral pronouns applied to non-binary people only recently after Demi Lovato has announced *their* non-binary identity.

After their Wikipedia page was updated with the new pronouns, I noticed that I have never seen that sort of English language structure in any other  texts I've read before, i.e., the person who updated the new pronouns seemed to avoid using ""they/them"" when referring to *Demi Lovato* and used, several times, only the name *Lovato* repeatedly to talk about *them*.  It's different when we look at other people's Wikipedia biographies who don't identify as non-binary and we can observe the use of pronouns  ""she/her/her"" or ""he/his/him"" alongside with the person's name instead of only her name written a bunch of times.

Does the kind of linguistic structure used in [Lovato's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Lovato)  are usual or unusual in English normative writing and/or everyday conversation among native speakers when referring to non-binary people?  If I write an essay talking about a non-binary person or a person who I  don't know the gender and apply that kind of structure, would it be correct in normative English?

In a  text structure like the following, how does a native speaker  distinguish if I'm referring to a group of people or to a single non-binary person?

""Jennifer is non-binary and uses the pronouns they/their/them. Jennifer and their friends went to the Shopping Mall yesterday to buy some stuff. *They* had a lot of fun.""

Does a native speaker understand that I'm referring to Jennifer and their friends and not Jennifer alone? Or should I have substituted ***They had a lot of fun*** for ***Jennifer and their friends had a lot of fun*** like in Lovato's Wikipedia text structure?

Or, if I want to refer to both Jennifer and their friends, could I put ***They and their friends had a lot of fun***, using ***They*** **referring to** ***Jennifer alone*** and ***Their friends*** ***to Jennifer's friends***? Would it be confusing to a native speaker?

If I have let the structure *They had a lot of fun*, would it be ambiguous? If I have used the structure found in Lovato's  Wikipedia Page, wouldn't it be redundant to repeat their name several times and not using different equivalent pronouns to their non-binary identity, giving a more even reading?

I'm sorry if you didn't understand what I was talking about. It's my third year studying English and I don't know how to properly formulate my reasoning yet. I know this is a delicate subject and I don't intend to offend anyone. I'm just worried about how this kind of structure can be confusing in a more complex text talking about non-binary people and  would like to know if there is a more efficient approach that could be taken.",1621967260,OwlFawkes,4,725,4514,123,18
linguistics,Podlachian Diphthongs,"I recently stumbled upon the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podlachian_microlanguage) on the Podlachian microlanguage. I guess this is a linguistic variety from the northeastern portions of Poland.

linguistics,Wondering if this is possible at all,"I came up with something called a ""character grid"", and I was wondering if it could work.

Essentially, you have a small square grid box, like a tic tac toe grid. In each of the squares would be a single character, and they were arranged in such a way that no matter how you read the grid (L to R, U to D, R to L, etc.), you could read something coherent, whether it was a word or a full sentence. For example:

|T|I|M|
|:-|:-|:-|
|E|I|S|
|N|O|W|

L to R, U to D, it would be TIMEISNOW (time is now)  
R to L, U to D (like Hebrew), it would be MITSIEWON (Mitsie won)  
U to D, R to L (like lit. Chinese), it would be MSWIIOTEN (Ms. Wii O' Ten...?)  
And so on with other ways of reading scripts (U to D, L to R, etc.)  


This example I gave doesn't exactly work as shown with that last example, so I was wondering if something like this is possible, where no matter how you read it you could read something coherent.

I am not talking about the already well defined ones such as the “un-in” merger into “æ̃” (in parisian french), but the currently ongoing changes. 

Here are the changes that I have noticed as a native Parisian french speaker (who lives in Paris) :

- full closing of the nasal vowel “ɔ̃” (already pronounced “õ”) to a nasal syllabic consonant “ɴ̩ʷ”
in very fast speed it can affect the following voiced plosive making it a syllabic consonant as well: “tombe” —&gt; “t̪ɴ̩ʷb”~“t̪ɴ̩ʷm”~”t̪m̩”

- beginning of a “ə-ɔ“ merger into “ɵ~ɔ” 
e.g. difficulties distinguishing “saurai” and “serai” 
“re-“ prefix realised as “ʁɔ” (“rocommencer”)

- weakening of “v” into “ɦ” or “ʕ” :
“voilà” “ɦʷala” ; “ça va” “saɦa”

unsurprising unstable R sound :

- “ɡʁ” and “kχ” can be realised as affricates, respectively “ɢ͡ʁ” and “q͡χ”

- depending on its position in the word, the R sound can be pronounced in various different ways, from “ɰ” and as far as a “ʢ”, all being allophones.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

linguistics,"In some languages, like Nepali, and besides that where I have observed it i.e., Japanese and Korean, there are onomatopoeic words that have nothing to do with sound at all because the phenomenon does not have any sound; is this present in other languages and can they be classified as onomatopoeia?","By general definition, onomatopoeia concerns the mimicking of sounds in nature by human languages. They have a coherent but diverse variation across the world's languages and a lot of vocabulary is even derived from them.

However, in Nepali, and besides that, Japanese and Korean, where I have observed this happen, there are quite a number of onomatopoeic words that describe things that do not produce any sound at all. In these cases, it mostly concerns emphasis on the phenomenon rather than mimicking any sound at all.

In Nepali, both the sound producing onomatopoeia and the ones that do not concern any sound are classified as **अनुकरणात्मक शब्द** (literally, ""imitative word"") in grammar.

Some Nepali examples are:

स्याउको बोटमा फलहरु **लटरम्म** फलेका छन्। = ""There are plenty of fruits in the apple tree.""

 transliteration = Syāuko boṭmā phalharu **laṭaramma** phalekā chan. 

Syau-ko = apple-genitive suffix; bot-ma = plant/tree-locative suffix; phal-haru = fruit-plural (fruits); **lataramma** = onomatopoeia (concerns plentiful production of fruits), phaleka chan = present perfective of phalnu, ""to ripen, to be produced(of fruits)""

literally = ""The apple tree has produced fruits **lataramma**.""

&amp;#x200B;

म त पानीले **निथ्रुक्क** भिजें।  = ""I am completely drenched/soaked in the rain.""

 transliteration = Ma ta pānīle **nithrukka** bhijen. 

Ma = first person singular(I), ta = emphasis particle; pani-le = water/rain-instrumental suffix; **nithrukka** = onomatopoeia (concerns being absolutely drenched by water), bhijen = simple past of bhijnu, ""to be wet""

literally : ""I am drenched by rain **nithrukka**.""

&amp;#x200B;

आकाशमा **टहटह** जुन लागेको छ। = ""The moon shines in the sky.""

 transliteration = Ākāśmā **ṭahaṭaha** jun lāgeko cha. 

Akash-ma = sky-locative suffix; **tahataha** = onomatopoeia; jun = moon; lageko cha = present perfective of lagnu, (means many things, compound verb here of  ""jun lagnu"" = ""to shine (of moon), like gham lagnu = to shine (of sun)

literally: ""The moon shines in the sky **tahataha**.""

&amp;#x200B;

मैले उसलाई देखेर **मुसुक्क** हासें। = ""I saw him and smiled.""

 transliteration : Mailē uslāī dekhera **musukka** hāse.  

Ma-le (maile) = I-nominative suffix; u-lai (uslai) = him-accusative suffix; (Nepali has split ergativity so my naming of the suffix can be wrong so these two basically show the subject and object in the sentence); dekhera = form of dekhnu, ""to see""; **musukka** = onomatopoeia (concerns the activity of smiling) ; hase = simple past of ""hasnu"" to smile

literally : ""I saw him and smiled **musukka**.""

&amp;#x200B;

There are manyyyyy other such words. A non exhaustive list with some examples are:

Such as **टुलुटुलु** tulutulu(concerns watching in an amused manner),

**प्याच्च** pyachcha(concerns abruptly speaking something),

 **किरिङ्गमिरिङ्ग** kiringmiring (concerns untidy or unintelligible writing or scribbles),

 **धुरुधुरु** dhurudhuru (concerns intense crying), 

**झिलिमिली** jhilimili (concerns repeated flashing of lights), 

**ह्वारह्वार** hwarhwar (concerns raging fire),

  **डम्म** damma (of overcast clouds), 

**टपक्क** tapakka (of picking up something),

 **खिस्रिक्क** khisrikka (concerns slight sound or movement) , 

**मिलिक्क** milikka (concerns flashing of light, usually lightning), 

**फनन** fanana (concerns spinning), 

**झमक्क** jhamakka (concerns getting dark) and so on.

As we can see, in all the sentences and these examples, the onomatopoeia mainly seems to describe the event in a certain, vivid manner so they tend to work as adverbs. The only difference is adverbs are mostly universal in their usage and they can be used with any verbs. (walk slowly, write slowly, speak slowly, swim slowly, fly slowly etc.) these ""onomatopoeia"" have very specific usage that are only relevant and ""correct"" in the appropriate scenario. 

There are also sound producing, generally understood onomatopoeia in the same category. Such as:

बादलले **गड्याङ्गगुडुङ्ग** गर्दै छ; अब छिट्टै पानी पर्नेछ। = ""The clouds are rumbling; it will rain soon.""

 transliteration = Bādal-lē **gaḍyāṅgguḍuṅg** gardai cha; aba chiṭṭai pānī parnēcha. 

badal-le = cloud-subject; **gadyangudung** = onomatopoeia (concerns rumbling of clouds, thunder); gardai chha (simple imperfective of garnu, ""to do""); aba = now; chhittai = soon, pani = rain; parnechha = simple future of ""parnu"", (means many things, compound verb here as ""pani parnu"" = ""to rain"")

literally = ""The clouds are doing **gadyangudung**; now it will rain soon.""

&amp;#x200B;

धारामा पानी **तपतप** गर्दैछ।  = ""The water is dripping in the tap.""

 transliteration = Dhārāmā pānī **taptap** gardaicha. 

dhara-ma = tap-at; pani = water, **taptap** = onomatopoeia (concerns dripping of liquid), gardaichha = present imperfective of garnu, ""to do"")

literally : ""The water in the tap is doing **taptap**.

Both of these concern events that do produce sound. This phenomenon of words describing events that do not have any sound or mostly concern the way something is also occurs in Japanese and Korean. Thus, my question is, do these types of words have a specific category and do they occur in other languages besides the one explained here?

linguistics,English vs Mandarin views of some basic concepts and when producing metaphors.,"Hello,

IANALinguist but I often need to translate texts from Chinese to English/French for others to read. I have noticed that my readers who are not so aware of Chinese culture tend to see metaphors where there are none or misunderstand some metaphors. Of course, as a translator, I should be the one to translate the metaphors so that there is no ambiguity, but there are some cases where I need to keep the Chinese wording.

The Routledge Handbook of Chinese Linguistics has a chapter on metaphors but I'd like to find some research that compares how Chinese people see some concepts vs how we see them: a classic example I can think of is the word ""dog"", which is much more negative in Chinese than in English, and ""blood"", which in my understanding is more positive and less gory in Chinese people's imagination than in our western imagination.

linguistics,Experiment: Does writing a closely related language in your native phonemic spelling improve intelligibility?,"I just had somewhat of a shower thought: if a relatively closely related language (same language family, large amount of cognates) was written using your native language, would this improve or decrease the amount of intelligibility? 

For example, if one were to write German using Dutch phonemic spelling, would it then be easier for Dutchmen to understand the German language?

|German (translation of the above sentence) written using Dutch phonetic spelling:|
|:-|
|*Wenn man Deutsch mit der niederländischen phonemischen Rechtschreibung schreiben würde, wäre es dann einfacher für Niederländer um die deutsche Sprache zu verstehen?* |
|*Wen man Doitsj miet deem niederlendisjen fonemiesjen rechtsjrijboenk sjrijben wurde, were es dan einfacher fuur Niederlender oem die doitsje sjpraache tsoe versteeën?*  |

or vice versa; if Dutch would be spelled in the German manner, would it be easier to understand for German speakers?

|Dutch (translation of the above sentence) written using German phonetic spelling:|
|:-|
|Wanneer Nederlands op de Duitse manier gespeld zou worden, zou het dan voor Duitstaligen beter te begrijpen zijn? |
|*Wannehr Nederlanz ob de Dauze mannier chespellt sau worden, sau het dann fohr Dauztahlige behter te begreipen sein?*   |

The thing is though, that I'm not entirely sure about the answer to my question ... it's kind of tricky. 

In the above example I didn't see any increase in intelligibility when using the alternative spelling at first. In fact, I thought it might have decreased. Certain words (like German um vs Dutch om) certainly seemed easier to recognize using regular spelling, but the longer I look at these sentences ... I don't know, after some acclimatizing I'm starting to think the ""Dutchified"" spelling of the German sentence actually might just be easier to understand. 

I'm fairly fluent in German, but I'm not a native so it's somewhat more difficult to judge the Germanized Dutch sentence, but I it's starting to grow on me as well. Maybe some native speakers could add their two cents on this. 

I think similar examples could be made (please feel free to do so) for other languages, say for Italian/French, Polish/Croatian, Finnish/Estonian, etc. I'm quite interested in how different examples would work out in regard to intelligibility.",1621803170,Paixdieu,15,362,2303,109,14

linguistics,Why is Standard Chinese considered to have a /ə/ phoneme?,"I was lurking on Wikipedia and stumbled across the vowels' section of the article about Standard Chinese phonology. According to the mainstream analysis, Chinese has 5 phonemic vowels: /i/ /u/ /y/ /a/ and /ə/. Let's review this analysis vowel by vowel.

Phoneme 1: it is always pronounced [i], no matter the context. We can definitely analyze it as a /i/ phoneme.

Phoneme 2: if followed by a /ŋ/, it is realized as a [ʊ]. In every other case, including when in isolation, it is pronounced [u], therefore it makes perfect sense to analyze the phoneme as /u/.

Phoneme 3: it is always pronounced [y], so it doesn't create any issues. The phoneme can be analyzed as /y/.

Phoneme 4: it is pronounced [ɛ] when followed by /n/ and [ɑ] when followed by /u/ or /ŋ/. However, in any other context (including when in isolation), it is realized as [a], so it's perfectly fine to analyze the phoneme as /a/.



Now onto phoneme 5, which has not two, not three, but *four* distinct realizations:

[e] when followed by /i/, or when preceded by /j/ or /ɥ/ if there is no coda

[o] when followed by /u/, or when preceded by /w/ if there is no coda

[ə] **when followed by a nasal**

[ɤ] **when not followed by a coda or preceded by a glide, and most importantly, when in isolation**



So as we can see, the schwa is not only one of many realizations of its phoneme, but it's the one that occurs in the least amount of environments. Why is it not analyzed as a /ɤ/ rather than a /ə/, since it's literally the way native speakers pronounce it in isolation and [ə] is such a specific realization that exclusively occurs before a nasal?",1621799961,Lapov,36,294,1619,57,10
linguistics,Is it common for the presence of phonemic vowel length distinctions to be hugely variable across dialects?,"I'm most familiar with English, which has a lot of variation in whether particular dialects have phonemic length distinctions. Middle English is likely to have had distinctions that were largely length-based, which have disappeared in all(?) modern dialects as a result of the Great Vowel Shift. A lot of modern dialects (like most of AmEng and West Country English) do not have any phonemic vowel distinctions that are purely length-based, whereas non-rhotic dialects (like standard southeastern British English and dialects across Oceania) have re-developed phonemic length distinctions along different lines.

I'm not that intimately familiar with any other language, but I've never heard of a dialect of Spanish (for example) that makes length distinctions, even though there are loads of dialects around the world. This might just be due to my inexperience with the language. 

Is the volatility of length distinctions just a coincidence in English? Is it a result of there being lots of relatively unconnected dialects? Is it because English dialects have large vowel inventories?",1621795855,Skipquernstone,26,167,1086,106,17

linguistics,How do Bantu languages (Shona in particular) work?,"When I learn a language, I like to not only speak and study individual pieces of grammar but try to get some basic intuition for how the language works on a higher level.

Eg as an English speaker learning Spanish, if your mindset is to constantly convert English to Spanish in your head, you will progress slower and your Spanish will be unidiomatic. To truly understand how Spanish works, it's critical to realize that, compared to English, in Spanish there is a much stronger reliance on verbs being conjugated to contain information that has to be communicated through other means in English. There's also word classes (el and la) which verbs and adjectives have to agree with.

Reading about Bantu languages, there's a lot of talk about how they have lots of word classes, eg Shona having 21 mupanda. But do eg verbs and adjectives have to be conjugated to agree with the mupanda? Eg in Spanish el chico lindo vs la chica linda

Or are the mupanda literally just categories of things that don't really affect the rest of the sentence eg in German der schöne Mann vs die schöne Frau (junge being a der word and frau being a die word not really affecting the rest of the sentence)

* ""produce"": noun = **/'prɑ dus/** ...|... verb = **/prə 'dus/**
* ""record"": noun = **/'rɛ kɚd/** ...|... verb = **/ rə 'kɔrd/**
* ""addict"": noun = **/'æ dɪkt/** ...|... verb = **/ə 'dɪkt/**

I’m curious about your perspectives in general, but I am also specifically interested in how this movement to pause cultural exchange in the use and evolution of language is viewed in the context of the science and history of language development. 

Some examples.

Tribe: Apparently has Roman origins and could be used to accurately describe groups of humans from every part of the world at different times in history, but is labeled as appropriation due to relatively recent use to describe Native American groups. 

Squad: Apparently has origins in the French military, and to my memory, has primarily been used in military contexts until adopted by hip hop culture in recent decades. And even then, usage in hip hop has often been specifically for the purpose of evoking military imagery. 

Picnic: Has origins in 17th century France, but internet rumor mills have described it as a shorthand phrase related to the lynching of African Americans. 


Some more questions: 

Is the movement against cultural appropriation of language viewed neutrally, as an interesting development?

Is it viewed as a ridiculously futile attempt to hold back the tide of the natural mechanisms of language development?

Is it a welcomed, or exciting, or a relief of some kind?

What are your opinions on inaccurate understanding of the origins of these words? Is it misguided, or does it matter less than more recent context? If the words are inflammatory today (even if they are only inflammatory because someone decided to label them so, and sometimes even create a false history to go with that label), is the long history of the word irrelevant to future usage?

Are there past examples of words that evaporated from common usage based on misinformation in the context of abrupt cultural shifts?

Okay, I know this post is a but all over the place, but I look forward to your replies.

linguistics,There is something wierd I noticed about my language (Hebrew),"The English suffix (a)tion have a Hebrew equivalents which are ציה and אציה (pronounced tzia and atzia). For example, animation in Hebrew is אנימציה (animatzia). I didn't understand why is that way, and how the suffixes developed, but I would like to know why is it that way. When I asked about it, people told me that it came from Russian, but it doesn't make sense because there's also another Hebrew suffix equivalent.

What I'm referring to is the Hebrew versions of the suffix (I)ty which are ות and יות (pronounced ut and your). For example, in Hebrew homosexuality is הומוסקסואליות (homosexualiut, sorry if I wrote the pronunciation of it wrong). So why did I mentioned this? Well that's because there is no (y)ut suffix in Russian, although I have preety bad Russian so I might be wrong. 

I would like to know:

1. If both come from Russian how they did developed?

2. If one did came from Russian while the other didn't, why it came from Russian?

3. Did it even came from Russian?

4. There's lots of other suffixes prefixes and suffixes in English that I'm not sure if they have Hebrew equivalents (anti, pro, ment, fy, Ify, ry, ery, ary, ence, ance, de, re, en etc.), How can I know if there is?

5. There are ones who might have. For example, for the suffix ess there's a few female Hebrew suffixes such as ה (only one letter, Pronounced as a), ית (pronounced as it), but there's also other female Hebrew suffixes but for plural version such as ות (pronounced as ot) and יות (pronounced as iot).

6. From which languages came the Hebrew suffixes and prefixes? I'll give examples to be more precise, sorry that I won't write in the Hebrew but only it the English pronunciation, it just really long to write:

A. Adjective suffixes- e (male version of a, exists only as a suffix for male only when the female is a), I (another male version) a (female version), et (female version), at (female version, not sure if regular version though or if it's of verbs), im (plural male version), ot (plural female version)

B. Verb suffixes and prefixes- י, ה, ת, א, נו, ים, ות, נ, תם, תן, ו
 A lot of them used for more one one type (of verbs) and pronounced sometimes differently

C. Nouns suffixes- ה, ות, יות

C. Ownership and relation nouns suffixes- י, תי, נו, תנו,

linguistics,Etymological vs Phonological Orthography,"Which one do you think is better? They both have clear advantages and disadvantages.

This question popped up in my mind while dealing with the Spanish verb ""haber."" It's spelling used to be ""aver"", which is exactly how it's pronounced. But this was changed to ""haber"" to reflect the Latin verb ""habere"" which it originates from.

At first, I thought this was stupid, since I was tired of the orthography of English and Korean. Both languages' spelling rules are more etymological than phonological, causing confusion to learners and native speakers alike. (Some of you may say that Korean orthography is perfectly phonological. In reality, it's more like French's. While it's entirely possible to figure out pronunciation from spelling, the reverse is impossible because of complicated spelling rules.)

Then I thought, without etymological spelling, it would be difficult to tell that ""he"" and ""ha"" are just different inflected forms of ""haber.""

For example, they replace the more commonly-used words ""namāz"" (prayer) and ""khudā"" (God) with the Arabic loanwords ""salāh"" and ""Allāh"" respectively.

Arabic phrases like ""Allāhu ā'lam"" (God knows best) and ""Jazākallāh"" (May God reward you) are used rather than Urdu equivalents like ""Khudā bahtar jāntā hai"" (God knows best) and ""Shukriyā"" (Thanks). 

Some speakers may also try to emulate as close a pronunciation to the original Arabic as possible for specific Arabic words rather than a standard Urdu pronunciation: for example, ""Ramzān"" is rendered ""Ramadān"", ""Kurān"" is pronounced ""Qur'ān"" with a glottal stop after the /r/, and ""Hadīs"" (Hadith) is pronounced ""Hadīt"".

These final examples are particularly interesting- I mean, the glottal stop in Qur'an that's not even part of Standard Urdu phonology! Very bizarre and very intriguing!

linguistics,What responsibility do linguists have to help the communities they study?,"I work as a linguist among a Bantu people group in West Africa. A French linguist came here and studied their language and music. He paid them, bought them food, drink, etc. When he had gathered data he went back to France. He called from time to time while finishing his dissertation. Once it was done he visited again and even gave out a couple copies of his dissertation. He returned to France and never called again. People from here called him from time to time but after awhile he asked them to stop calling. Now it is the consensus here that he was really a spy and was no better than the colonizers of the past. 

Another (national) linguist basically did the same thing. She came to one of the villages, studied the language, paid people gave them gifts and food. But once she finished her dissertation she has never been back.

I've been doing some reading on Mandarin linguistics, and particularly phonetics, recently. I encountered some discrepancies when it comes to the description of certain consonants.

I stumbled upon the following discrepancies:

1) Some sources claim that e.g. q t͡ɕʰ \[a+\] and j t͡ɕ \[a-\] are prepalatal affricates, and not alveolo-palatal affricates. Is this just a difference in terminology?

2) p pʰ \[a+\] - b p \[a-\] : are they bilabial or labial?

3) c t͡sʰ \[a+\] - z t͡s \[a-\] : alveolar affricates or dental sibilants?

The latter solutions (labial, dental sibilants) were taken from Francis D. M. Dow's *An Outline of Mandarin Phonetics*. Is this book still relevant or would you suggest I look up these problems in a more recent book? What is the must-read work about Mandarin phonetics?

linguistics,Dialect Dissection: Indie Voice/Cursive Singing - Updated!,"Hey, everyone! I’m the writer of the original indie voice article. I’ve been posting here for months saying I have some big update in the works, and I am pleased that [this big update is finally ready](https://www.acelinguist.com/2021/05/dialect-dissection-indie-voicecursive.html). It’s a total rewrite, I’ve added new examples, and the theoretical understanding has changed as well.

Some important new findings:

* Documenting features of “indie voice” that hadn’t been described yet, such as lack of aspiration in fortis consonants (/p/, /t/, /k/), the /ɛ/ vowel lowering to \[æ\], and the common realization of words like ‘down’ with \[aʊ\] (and not \[æʊ\]).
* Finding IRL examples of “indie diphthongization.” There had been discussion about whether this feature could be found in person or was particular to sung speech. I found examples, as well as a source potentially describing this feature.
* Expanding the register-based analysis of indie voice, and introducing a concept from language contact
* Everyone's always telling me to include Billie Holiday, and she's finally here :)

I feel like there’s more I could add, and there’s still a lot of uncovered ground on this topic. “Indie voice” is significantly larger and more diverse than the singular name would imply. But I have already spent more than three years working on unraveling indie voice, so I would love to take a break and read other people’s work on indie voice in the future.

I hope you all get something from this updated version of the article, and if you have any questions, fire away! I love talking about the methodology, and I went through multiple potential analyses of the final result.

linguistics,"English sign of infinitive change when used with ""try""","Hope everyone is doing well.

I recently became aware of a structure in English (my native language) that changes the sign of the infinitive when used with the auxiliary verb ""try"". I'm a university student minoring in linguistics, so I have some formal training, but I've only done research in phonology and phonetics. I did an informal poll across other people at my college and found I was not alone in having this construction.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples:

""And"" sign - *I will try and go to the store.*

""To"" sign    - *I will try to go to the store.*

&amp;#x200B;

""And"" sign - *I have to try and stop him!*

""To"" sign    - *I have to try to stop him!*

&amp;#x200B;

Both of these have the same meaning to me, only differentiating in formality; the ""and"" construction being more informal. This is different when compared to simultaneous and consecutive verbs, along with method verbs (verbs that can follow ""in order"").

*I will drink (in order) to forget Linda.*

*I will drink and forget Linda.*

&amp;#x200B;

*I punched my brother to make him remember what he did.*

*I punched my brother and made him remember what he did.*

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few questions:

1. Does this feature have a name? I don't know what to search in order to find some research on this topic.
2. How common is this feature? What dialects of English permit the ""and"" sign to be used?
3. Can you use a different auxiliary verb other than ""try""? I could only think of examples for this case. Must it be an auxiliary verb?
4. Are there any other cases where the sign of the infinitive changes in English? I am only aware of its removal when tense is applied.
5. Are there examples in your native language where this occurs?

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

linguistics,When did the phoneme /f/ enter Old Church Slavonic and why was it sometimes written like a /p/ (п)?,"Hello r/linguistics,

According to Wikipedia, both Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Slavic didn't have the /f/ phoneme. Does anyone know when and how this sound entered Old Church Slavonic? Did it only enter the phonetic inventory of the Early Slavs when Greek words containing the /f/ were loaned into OCS? Did it become widespread due to its presence in both the Glagolitic and Cyrillic scripts? And also, why were Greek loans containing that sound sometimes written with a «п» (p), like пиникисиѩ instead of финик҄исиꙗ?

linguistics,How do you think humans would have named a twin star of our Sun?,"Hi everyone!

First of all, I would like to apologize for my lack of knowledge and my potentially janky english (I'm french and I had never done any type of research on linguistics before this).

I am an author working on a novel taking place in a world where our sky was inhabited by a second sun until the start of the bronze age (around 3000 BCE). 

The word we use for Sun (in french ""Soleil"") comes from the latin word ""sol"" and from what I've seen, all languages around the world seem to use a similar word for our star.

I know research on pre-historic languages is difficult, but do you think it's possible the word for ""sun"" has been similar since the beginning of languages? And if there had been a second star in our sky for some part of our History, what do you think we would call it today?

I'm aware this is a very weird question, and I apologize if it doesn't belong here. If anyone has any information that could help me with this, even some basic proto-indo-european (or any other prehistoric language) knowledge, I'd love to know how you think humans would have named a smaller, dimmer twin star of our sun.

linguistics,"In the Nepali language, there is an aspect that denotes events that happened in the past time but were only recently known/realized by the observer. Is there a standard term for this aspect/grammatical feature and does it exist in other languages?","Good afternoon everyone! 

I hope everyone is staying safe and well.

Nepali verbs inflect for an **अज्ञात भूत** (agyāt bhūt literally, ""unknown past"") aspect of the past tense. It denotes events that took place in the past at an unknown time but were only known by an observer recently (who does not know when the event took place). This is one of the 5 aspects of the past tense. (simple, imperfective(ongoing/incomplete), perfective(complete), habitual and ""unknown""). The present and future tenses only have simple, imperfective and perfective aspects.

Real life examples of the ""unknown past"" would be a person realizing that someone has slept or eaten something or fallen asleep or gone home, without their initial presence or knowledge of so event.

1. **जोन त सुतेछ। (literally :** ***""(I just realized) John has slept.""*****)**
2. **तिमीले खाना खाएछौ।  (literally :** ***""(I just realized) You have eaten/had dinner.""*****)**
3. **मार्क घर गएछ। (literally :** ***""(I just realized) Mark has gone home.""*****)**
4. **म त निदाएछु। (literally :** ***""(I just realized) I had\* fallen asleep.""*****)** (I have used had in this translation because one cannot realize that one had fallen asleep until after they have woken up, so.)

Even though I have used ***""I just realized""*** for the conveyance of the meaning, there are no words denoting ""I just realized"" in the sentences. A more comprehensive meaning would be ""I don't know when it happened but I just realized that Mark has gone home."" for the third example.

 It could very well be represented as ***""John has apparently slept.""*** or ***""You have apparently eaten/had dinner.""*** or ***""Mark has apparently gone home.""*** or ***""I had apparently fallen asleep.""*** because the sentence does not state any pronoun in case of who is observing it. I just didn't use ""apparently"" explicitly because it tends to bring in evidentiality when all the events actually did take place and the speaker knew directly and there is no explicit evidential distinction in any tenses.

The sentences only convey the part after ""I just realized"". The inflection of the verb implies that the event happened in the past and it is not known when that was and the observer only recently realized the happening of so event and does not know when it took place.

The event also need not be complete or ongoing. In the first case of John, when the speaker saw him, it implies that he is still asleep. In the second case, when the speaker knew it, ""you"" had completed eating dinner. While in Mark's case, when the speaker knew it, Mark had already gone home so he could either be on the way or have already reached home. In case of one realizing that they had fallen asleep, they had already woken up by the time so the action of sleeping was complete and they only didn't realize when they had fallen asleep.

This is different than the supposedly analogous example I have given with the present/past perfect because a perfective aspect of all three general tenses does exist distinctly in the Nepali language.

1. **मार्क घर गएको छ। (literally :** ***""Mark has gone home.""*****)** 
2. **तिमीले खाना खाएको छौ।  (literally :** ***""You have eaten/had dinner.""*****)**
3. **मार्क घर गएको थियो। (literally :** ***""Mark had gone home.""*****)**
4. **तिमीले खाना खाएको थियौ। (literally:** ***""You had eaten dinner.""*****)**

In these scenarios, the speaker knows that Mark went home in the present (first case) and in the past (second case). Or that ""you"" had eaten dinner in the present or the past in the latter two cases. These are part of the **पूर्ण भूत** (""complete"" past in sentence 1. and 2.) and **पूर्ण वर्तमान** (""complete"" present in sentence 3. and 4.) aspects because they denote that the action that took place had been completed when an observer knew it.

Contrary to this, in the second case of the first three sentences, the speaker does not know when Mark went home and only realized recently. They also did not know when ""you"" had eaten dinner. But both of those events happened in the past. So this form is used.

I am sorry if this rather confusing; I have relentlessly tried looking for an analogous name for this ""unknown"" aspect or grammatical feature but I have not found anything similar or relatable and thus thought I should ask here. I do not know if this is some bizarre kind of evidentiality or mood masquerading among aspects either so some help in understanding this would be thoroughly appreciated.

Thank you!",1621237382,Nish_thp,52,750,4477,247,41

linguistics,Experiment on iconicity,"Hello! In the context of linguistic and cognitive studies, I have to replicate a certain experiment in which you have to decide whether or not the English words you are presented with are iconic according to you. There are no right or wrong answers; trust your first impression. It takes about 5 minutes to complete the experiment.

In the quotation below, Winter et al. (2017: 447) - the researchers whose experiment I will replicate - explain what they understand by iconicity:

""Some English words sound like what they mean. For example, SLURP sounds  
like the noise made when you perform this kind of drinking action. An example  
that does not relate to the sound of an action is TEENY, which sounds like  
something very small (compared to HUGE which sounds big). These words are  
iconic. You might be able to guess these words’ meanings even if you did not  
know English. Words can also sound like the opposite of what they mean. For  
example, MICROORGANISM is a large word that means something very small.  
And WHALE is a small word that means something very large. And finally, many  
words are not iconic or opposite at all. For example there is nothing canine or feline  
sounding about the words DOG or CAT. These words are arbitrary. If you did  
not know English, you would not be able to guess the meanings of these words"".

Why? It makes more sense to write it with the apostrophe. We don't write ""the cats bowl"", we write ""the cat's bowl"". So why can't ""its bowl"" be written as ""it's bowl""?

And before you say ""*it's* is a contraction of *it is*"", just that a spelling is used for one thing doesn't mean it can't be used for another. In the phrases ""the cat's sleeping"", ""the cat's been sleeping"", and ""the cat's bowl"", ""cat's"" means the contraction for ""cat is"" in the first, ""cat has"" in the second, and ""of the cat"" in the third. The same punctuation is used for three different things. Nobody complains, because the context makes it unambiguous what it means.

In fact, historically, ""it's"" was what everybody used, and thus is was considered correct. Then ""its"" became more common, and people for some reason decided that ""it's"" should be incorrect. Yet people constantly use it that way. Apparently it's okay that people changed the punctuation back then, but they're not allowed to change it now?

Whether or not the Oxford comma appears, neither are unanimously said to be wrong. Let's do the same for the ""it's"" apostrophe.",1620963419,nam3pbrc,3,215,1238,57,10
linguistics,Please explain descriptivism to a non-linguist,"I came upon the terms ""descriptivism"" and ""descriptive linguistics"" for the first time today, but they seem to pertain to a question that has puzzled me for years:

What is the test of correct use of language? 

Today I came upon the phrase ""could care less"" which has always sounded ridiculous to my ears. Though I know this to be common in American English, I can conceive it as nothing but a bastardisation or miscomprehension of ""couldn't care less"". But when reading a Reddit discussion on the matter I found a self-described descriptivist (clunky, I know) declaring that whatever ""sounds right"" to Native speakers **is** right. 

This seems akin to the odious proposition that an idea is true if enough people believe it. I heard a similar argument made years ago, when ""literally"" got a new dictionary definition that was opposite to its original (and, in my view, true) meaning. More importantly, this vague definition begs these questions: 

How many native speakers must accept a usage case or definition before it is deemed correct?

Supposing such a threshold could be firmly defined, how would anyone determine when it had been met?

I appreciate the desire to democratise language and validate local dialects, but if the boundaries of correctness are forever expanded, surely everything becomes correct and ""correct"" ceases to be a meaningful designation.

I know my own arguments are not watertight (e.g. language evolves naturally and English could be said to be no more than a bastardisation of Latin (which in turn is a bastardisation of...), language and ideas are not perfectly analogous, I have ignored the importance context etc. etc.). As hinted at by the title, I have no background in linguistics. I would be very grateful if someone recommended a good book that deals with this topic.",1620941778,polar2019,2,299,1810,46,6

linguistics,"Recursion, Chomsky, and the Pirahã language","Hello everyone :)  
This post stems from a question I meant to ask [Dan Everett at his AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nar5c1/my_name_is_dan_everett_and_i_am_a_linguist/). Since I missed the AMA and I'm still quite confused about this subject, I'm wondering if any of you can help me understand it.

Essentially I'm trying to understand what people mean by 'recursion' in linguistics, especially as it relates to the debate between Chomsky and Everett over whether or not recursion is a universal property of language, and whether the lack of recursion in an individual language (Pirahã) would refute its universality.

What I understand by recursion is, essentially, the capacity to insert sentences into larger sentences, creating new sentences that are still grammatically correct. For example: ""he wants to eat"" can become ""he says that he wants to eat."" It's pretty obvious that in English this process could theoretically go on forever: you can stick together however many ""he says that"" or ""he wants to"" and the result is still grammatically correct, although it gets harder to follow (""he says that she says that they said that he wants to say that they said that....."").

Is my understanding of 'recursion' correct?  
And if it is correct, can anybody explain to me how Everett's research into the Pirahã language proves that this feature is not present in Pirahã?   
I haven't been able to find any actual examples of the language showing how somebody would express the concept ""he says that he wants to eat"". It seems logical to me that if you can express the concepts ""He says that he wants"" &amp; ""He wants to eat"" in Pirahã, it would follow that recursion is possible in the language, by which I mean that the sentence ""he said that he wants to eat"" would be totally understandable and grammatically correct, as would be larger more recursive variations. Everything that I've read/heard about Pirahã seems to skirt around the issue, and the main claim seems to be that Pirahã *doesn't show* recursion. But just because people aren't using recursion in everyday speech doesn't mean that speakers wouldn't readily understand a recursive sentence, and consider it grammatically viable.

He vehemently disagreed with me and said he needs to go to the gym because he needs to stay in shape.

He is confusing action vs result, and there for making a false statement by saying he would always rather play golf than go to the gym on a nice day. If that were the case, then he would play golf today. 

His desire to stay in shape outweighs the enjoyment he gets from golf. Therefore when making a simple decision and comparing the actions only, he would actually rather go to the gym than play golf today.

linguistics,My (uni paper) take on - How language and priming affect perception (Cognitive-Linguistics),"Imagine a blue horse skiing across an Olympics rink. It is amazing how our minds can create a vivid image of something we have never seen before using language, a hallmark of human existence. **I will be exploring the ways in which language affects our perception of the world – on an individual, social and global level. I will then be exploring the ways in which priming effects in media enhance language’s effects on our perception.** 

**Language structures** **affect how we remember things**. A study in eye-witness memory (Fausey, Boroditsky, 2010) found that English speakers remembered the agents of accidental events better than did Spanish speakers due to their agentive language; an English speaker would say “he dropped the vase” while a Spanish speaker would say “the vase was dropped”. Grammatical gender too affects the way we describe objects – “bridge” is feminine in Spanish and masculine in German, so speakers describe bridges as “beautiful” and “strong” respectively (Boroditsky, Schmidt, Phillips, 2003). Language affects how an individual remembers events and objects. 

Different structures of the same language can **denote the formality of social situations**. According to the Accommodation Theory (Giles, Coupland, Coupland, 1991), as social creatures, we deliberately converge our language patterns to fit in with the crowd. A local might code-switch to the less formal language structure to signal intimacy with fellow locals but use proper English when overseas to be perceived as educated – like a Singaporean saying “Is that so?” instead of the Singlish “Where got?”. Therefore, the language used in social situations affects one’s perception of its formality.  

Different pronunciations of the same language could also be used to **denote identity**. As found by Labov (1963) on Martha’s Vineyard, locals subtly and subconsciously varied their pronunciation to differentiate from standard American pronunciation norms brought over by mainland Americans holidaying there. The same can be said of different accents belonging to different states/countries, and an individual’s strategic choice to use the various accents available to them. These links between language structure/pronunciation and perceived identity becomes more important in our globalizing landscape. 

Language structures in media are crafted to **affect perceptions of stereotypes and agency**. Following the Marked Versus Unmarked theory (Jakobson, 1932), news like “Millennials are broke” frequently generalizes large groups of people like who depart from the insider group’s social norms. According to the Us Versus Them theory (Gumperz, 1982), this divide portrays the outsider group as inferior. The phrasing of headlines, like “Government raises tax” versus “Tax gets raised”, also affects our perception of agency. In this way, media language brings our attention to specific aspects of an event and specific traits of large groups, which is especially important to be aware of in the current fight against fake news. 

An interesting theory which further informs our perception of media language is the **cognitive phenomenon of Priming** (Horner, Henson, 2008), where exposure to a stimulus (the prime) influences its later identification and classification (the target). Priming is commonly used in media language, especially in advertising, **to create associations** and build desire for frivolous products. It is also used in propaganda - the Bush campaign launched a television ad containing a frame with the word “RATS” in a scaled-up font size during his campaign against Democrat Al Gore (Weinberger, Westen, 2008) to create negative associations for the democrats. Priming is therefore extremely dangerous as it builds subconscious perceptions/stereotypes. 

One form of priming is **associative priming, where item recognition improves after a related stimulus**. Associative priming is frequently used in subliminal marketing – as found by Vicary (1955), “priming consumers with the name of a thirst-quenching beverage makes it more likely that they will choose that beverage”. In another study, participants who had been primed by words associated with elderly stereotypes walked slower than those who had not been (Bargh, Chen, Burrows, 1996). Through the perceptions created by associative priming, language can be clearly seen to affect our behaviour. 

Another form is **repetition priming is when item recognition improves the more it is repeated**. This is most commonly seen in the bombardment of brand and slogans through various mediums. For example, celebrities are often used to endorse products since we can recognize faces even when they were seen in a different context and even with poor explicit memory of the face (Bruce, Carson, et al, 1998). A linguistic example is Nike’s “Just Do It” slogan, which increased Nike’s worldwide sales from $877 million to $9.2 billion from its launch in 1988 to 1998. Repetition priming gains credibility due to the Illusory Truth Effect – where familiarity is confused with credibility. 

Ultimately, the languages we likely grow up with affect our understanding of the world on an individual, social and global level, as described above. **As influential linguist Edward Sapir (1949) wrote, “The worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same worlds with different labels attached”.** While we discuss the influence on language on perception, the debate between the blurred lines of influence between language, culture and thought continues. It is therefore important to be aware of the influence of language in the ways we create our identities, treat each other and consume information.",1620754883,tartdesigns,7,861,5700,91,13

linguistics,"This week's Q&amp;A thread -- please read before asking or answering a question! - May 10, 2021","Do you have a question about language or linguistics? You’ve come to the right subreddit! We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1620668052,AutoModerator,291,479,2762,95,17
linguistics,"Linguists, is there any ambiguity in this word problem.","When I was 6  
My sister was half my age  
Now I’m 70  
How old’s my sister ?  

My position is that here is not enough information provided to be able to say. It could mean that my sister was half my age at that time, or half of six. Or that my sister was half my age now, half of 70. The reader is forced to make an assumption. The most common assumption is that it refers to the person’s age at that time, but neither one is correct or incorrect because it’s simply not specified. It’s intentional ambiguity to cause arguments. 

And an arguer states that:  
There's literally only one way to read it. ""when I was 6"" ""my sister was half my age"" meaning she was 3 when they were 6 ""now I'm 70"" you can do the math. If they didn't include the ""now"" when saying they were 70 then maybe your argument would have a leg to stand on but right now your simply dead wrong and doubling down like a fool

linguistics,Dark l pronunciation: the only pronunciation that I can't work out perfectly for a very long time,"For many years, I have a problem with pronouncing dark l in the right way. It is the only sound that I cannot pronounce correctly so as not to cause me problem.

To briefly mention my English backgrounds, I grew up in many different countries and have a mixed accent that tend to change depending on who I'm talking. I think for the 'l' sound I have the Korean accent and that gives me the problem.

I have read and seen so many posts and videos on how to pronounce the sound but I'm not sure if any of them worked for me or if I'm making the right sound. So I recorded myself pronouncing the same words with different ways I found on the internet. I would like it very much if you guys could tell me about it. I know my vowel sounds are not good here, but you guys can skip on them because I was focusing on the l sound.

Bill, felt, feel, pal, will, tell, all, ball, table, little, mall, shall, real, deal, seal, pill, doll, girl, world, poll, roll, bull, cool, full, fool, dull, null, rule, pull, pool, tool

Ways:

1. comfortably

2. In a Korean way

3. the way I learned from a video by an English girl

4. pulling the back of my tongue up

5. the way I learned from this (most likely) American girl living in Japan. She said to pull the tongue back first and then touch with my tongue tip the alveolar ridge (the area behind my upper teeth)

6. Making the sound by narrowing the space in the back of my mouth. I was doing this by narrowing the space between the back of my tongue and the soft palate (or even further inside. I'm not sure)

7. I followed a video by a Korean guy who said to make the sound as if you're making the sound in your throat.

linguistics,Why is written English so similar to spoken English?,"Most other languages with literary traditions of some time depth seem to have significant diglossia. With French, for example, there are noticeable grammatical differences between typical written French and typical spoken French: negation with *ne*, the acceptability of the *redoublement du sujet*, the simple past tense, and so on. Significant written-spoken differences also exist in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, despite the fact that all three had major language reforms within the past century specifically to make the written language more vernacular (言文一致).

And this isn't even getting to languages with full-on diglossia even today, like Arabic, Tamil, or Mongol (as used in China).

By contrast, it seems like written English is much more affected by spoken English—the main differences just seem to be in terms of vocabulary, without these sorts of grammatical differences. The distinction also seems much more permeable; people write English novels in quite colloquial language, but it would be very strange to write a Korean novel in the conversational speech level.

I have been reading Chomsky for a long time now and his book ""On Languages"" piqued my interest in Linguistics. Soon after, I started solving linguistics puzzles as a way to introduce myself to the subject. Earlier this year, I wrote the National Linguistics Olympiad and failed miserably. And mind you, I went in prepared for the Olympiad. I has solved the previous year papers made available by the organizing committee and I made sure that I solved all the questions exhaustively without leaving any part. One thing, I realized while I was writing the exam was the fact that the technique I employed to solve these puzzles was time-consuming, cumbersome and somewhat primitive.   
After the Olympiad, one of the organizer was kind enough to give me the instructors material that they use to teach the students who qualify that Olympiad. However, the techniques mentioned in the material were a little bit shrouded with ambiguity for I am totally uneducated in linguistics and its terminology.

linguistics,Passives of Ditransitives,"I hope I have posted in the right location—I couldn't find the answer in beginners' textbooks. Essentially, I'm perplexed by agreement phrases in passivised ditransitives.

I've been (re-?)teaching myself syntax from the third edition of Andrew Carnie's *Syntax: A Generative Introduction*. I've been grappling with one of the exercises for chapter 14 on Expanded VPs (essentially v, AgrO, AgrIO). In the workbook, a number of related sentences are given for diagramming practice:

1. The waiter sent a free drink to the charming man.
2. A free drink was sent to the charming man.
3. The waiter sent the charming man a free drink.
4. The charming man was sent a free drink.

It's with sentence four that I run into difficulties. (The first two aren't actually ditransitive, right?) Carnie describes the passive *be* as selecting directly for a VP, rather than an AgrOP as an active v would do. Without AgrOP, the theme of the verb cannot be assigned accusative case &amp; thus for joint reasons of case assignment &amp; EPP moves to spec T where it takes the nominative.

However, in the solution for this problem the complement of the passive *be* is not a VP, but instead a vP. The complement of the lower v is AgrOP. The complement of the main verb moves to spec AgrOP; the spec of the lower vP moves to spec T. Here's an image of the tree: [https://imgur.com/a/1olO65l](https://imgur.com/a/1olO65l)

I have not been able to find anything on-line that confirms this, but it seems to me like a better characterisation of the passive construction is *not* that the passive v selects directly for a VP (it does not do so here) or that it drops AgrOP (AgrOP remains here), but rather that the highest level agreement phrase is axed. In this case, it's AgrIOP that is removed. Because in sentence 3, AgrIOP's complement was a vP rather than a VP, the passive v takes a vP complement (rather than the VP given in Carnie's description). Am I getting this right?

I'm aware that Minimalism has developed ways to address syntax without agreement phrases. However, my expectation is that I'll understand more recent theory better if I have a solid grasp of its development.

Much thanks in advance for any help.",1620543455,Pathawi,5,377,2204,25,3

linguistics,How many tenses are there in English?,"At my university there was a hotly debated topic in the linguistics department, namely, how many tenses are there in English?  


When I was training to be an EFL teacher, I was taught that strictly speaking, English only has 2 tenses. The reasoning was that the technical definition of a tense is when an inflectional morphological change has occurred, so the only two examples of this in English would be the present simple, with the 3rd person singular *-s* suffix, and the past simple, with the *-ed* suffix. Temporal information could also be conveyed using the perfect constructions, or with the modal verb *will* to convey future actions, but these are not tenses, so I was told.   
However, at my university the various professors had differing views on this, some stating the use of the modal verb *will* to convey future actions is in fact a tense. It was all very controversial.  


Rodney Huddleston in his enormous book *The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language* states there are two 'tense systems'. **Primary tense**, he says, is present simple and past simple (or preterite as he says), is contrasted with **Secondary tense** which includes perfect (*have* \+ participle) and non-perfect. So this is another subtly different view on the matter.

But I can't formalize that intuition at all, and I'm curious whether anyone has. Might it have something to do with the ordering of affixes, too?",1620500217,yaikiyawun,7,75,417,105,16

LINGUISTICS:  the study of language(s).

I.    Idiolect:  [idio__self____    lect____speech____]     an individual variation on a language.

    HUH?  You are your own instrument.  Nobody speaks/communicates exactly like you.
    These three factors make your speech unique:

    A.    Suprasegmental features:  [supra___Above, beyond______    segmental______The parts/individual elements______]
                    [ It is not what you say, but how you say it.]
        l.  pitch levels--high/low sound frequency
            a.  English has 4 pitch levels.  Spanish has 3.  The highest level is used to register great excitement or to call attention.  Sustained usage of this highest level is extremely annoying to the listener. (See notes below. A1 pitch)

            b.  Little or no change in pitch is monotone.  Sustained usage of the same level is boring to the listener.
        
       2.  juncture--space/time between words
        a.  small juncture=nervousness, excitability, insincere (trying to convince/confuse)
        b.  large juncture=slow, struggling to think

    B.    Pronunciation:  is affected by
        l.  shape of the nasal passage    3.  vocal chords
        2.  palate                                       4.  teeth

    C.    Word Choice/Vocabulary.  You are your own dictionary.  The words you know and choose to use are affected by:
Teacher presents each category and gives an example or two. Afterwards students are divided in groups of four and they have to brainstorm examples and each category.

        l.    you are male or female/Your gender identification
        example #1 ____darling__
 Explain: A girl can say that’s a darling dress. What if a man says to another man that’s a darling tie? 
        example #2. Go Girlfriend
Explain: A girl can say, You go girlfriend. Can a man say the same thing to another man?
        
       2.  Age--your generation vs other generations
        example #1 far out, wicked 
Explain: Those are expressions from your grandparents generation to expressive great approval.
        example #2 _____________
Explain:_____________________________________________________________________________
        
       3.  Socio-economic level--socio=what you like to do, interests, level of education, friends economic=what you do for a living.  Your vocabulary is influenced by your interests, friends, job, level of education, etc.      jargon=job related vocabulary
           
         example #1 Dolly
Explain:  a hand truck used to haul heavy objects. Not a child’s toy  

        example #2 _____________
Explain:_____________________________________________________________________________

        4.  Geography/geographic area--where you live/what country/what area of that country

        example #1. Fixin’s
Explain:  Side dishes or condiments like Turkey dinner with all the Fixin’s

        example #2 _____________
Explain:_____________________________________________________________________________

                                                      
II.    Dialect:  [di two/Multiple_    lect_speech___]  a shared social or geographic variation on a language.    Texans speak differently than New Yorkers.  You can tell a Yank from a Brit, a Brit from an Aussie.  

    A.  Pronunciation  Canadian pronunciation of House or about versus American pronunciation. British pronunciation of schedule versus American.

      B.  Word Choice Americans say hood of a car/British say the bonnet. The British say biscuit/Americans say cookie.     

Show addition IIB

Mexican Spanish, Argentina Spanish, Iberian Spanish are dialects of Spanish, not different languages.  When people say speak American, they are referring to the various American dialects—Bostonian, Southern, etc. American is NOT A LANGUAGE!!!!!!!!


III.    Language:  mutually intelligible means of communication.
In the long, long ago in the distant past, if people who spoke different dialects were separated by time and space, those dialects could become so different that they morfed into different languages. There differences became so great that they could no longer communicate easily. 


IV.    Family:  a group of related languages.  
    A.  Romance (Latin based):  Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, etc.

    [English is special.  Much of its vocabulary is Romance/Latin based, but English grammar is a mixed of Romance and Germanic influences.  You can thank the Angles/Saxons (Germanic) and the Romans/Normans (Romance).    Remember the Norman invasion of 1066!!

    B.  Germanic:  German, English, Norwegian, Swedish, etc.

Stereotype:  a general statement meant to characterize an entire  group/category, usually negative.

Linguistics lecture page 3

Did you ever wonder why English has one word for the name of the animal but a different word for the meat of the same animal?

Pig but pork.                                     Puerco.......carne de puerco                        
Cow/Cattle but beef.                        Res............carne de res
Bird/Chicken but poultry.                 Pollo...........carne de pollo

“Pig”, “cow”, “chicken” come from the Germanic based language of the Anglo-Saxons. The lower classes, who took care of the live animals, used those words for them, but hardly ever got to eat them. The Anglo-Saxons had been conquered by the French speaking Franks. So, the lower class Anglo-Saxons referred to the animal in the field as a pig, but when the pig was prepared as food and served to the upper class Franks, the French word was used, pork.... And that’s why English has one set of words for living animals and a different set for their meat. Over time, the Germanic Language of the Anglo-Saxons merged with Latin French of the Franks to result in English. English vocabulary and grammar are a combination of the two influences.

The two influences can also be seen when forming plural nouns in English.

Latin influence… Add an S to the end of the noun to make the plural.

                   Hat… Hats         Car… Cars

Germanic influence… Make an internal change to   Woman… Women          Man....Men

Spanish never ha a Germanic influence. So, in Spanish, we add an S to the end of the noun when the noun ends in a vowel. If the noun ends in a consonant, we add ES.

Coche....Coches                    Uva......Uvas
Reloj...Relojes                       Rincón.....Rincones

How and why English speakers stereotype other languages. Page 4 of the Linguistics Lecture

What makes a language attractive – its sound, national identity or familiarity?

A1 Explanation of pitch levels

English has four levels (from level one being the lowest, to level four, the highest), whereas Spanish has three levels. These are relative pitches, as everybody's basic pitch level will be different. Level two is known as the “mid” pitch, with level three being slightly higher, and level one slightly lower.

English.   A typical intonation pattern in English is with “informational” questions. Usually, when someone asks “where are you going?” in a natural setting, the pitch pattern starts on level two and moved up to level three.

Spanish.   If we apply the English intonation to Spanish information questions, it will sound wrong to them. Spanish speakers use a falling intonation, or a rise and then a fall for added emphasis.  The Spanish pitch starts a level two and then moves down to level one. So, An English speaker may not recognize this as a question. This is why, sometimes your world language teacher may ask you to repeat, and you wonder why because you think you have the correct grammar and vocabulary. The teacher may just want to work on your pitch.

SNL. Example of pitch… He doesn’t care what they say, it’s how they say it.

linguistics,Where to start with linguistics? (as a language learner),"Hi,

I'd really appreciate of your well-informed opinions on where I should start with linguistics.

I am a university language student, and I am very much interested in learning about linguistics, particularly as a means to better understand the languages which I learn. I doubt I'd be so interested in the areas of linguistics that appear more theoretical, or at least don't have as much of a practical application in gaining a more comprehensive understanding of current modern languages. Of course however, if you think learning about those things is important and relevant, then please say so, since it is likely that I am just making an uneducated assumption to the extent of their relevance to better understanding the languages which I learn.

I would really like to have the resources, knowledge, critical thinking abilities to understand where the languages I learn came from, what contact they have had (or currently are having) with each other and with other languages, and why they are the way they are. I understand this might sound vague, but I think that's simply because I don't yet have the information required to appropriately express what I want to learn. If you think that I should provide more specific information, then let me know, and I'll do so.

If it would be of help in providing me with advice, then I can partially explain a question that I am still looking for the answer to. I don't want to state too much information, because I'm thinking of making this a research question, and don't want somebody to steal it lol (sorry). I have also checked the relevant language's linguistics journals and searched the internet pretty heavily (imo), but I can't find the answer to this at all: in one of the languages I learn, there is a letter which differs in its pronunciation depending on its phonetic surroundings/quality (those might not be the right terms, sorry). However, there is also another possible pronunciation which occurs, where it sounds like it is either deleted or rendered into some sort of semi-vowel (I can't quite tell, and don't know enough about the sounds to tell). Is linguistics the kind of thing to learn about to begin to be able to answer this type of question? And is this the sort of thing one could turn into a dissertation? Again, if I need to be more precise, then please let me know.

linguistics,Are mixed-origin names fairly recent?,"This may apply to other European-language countries as well, but (non-English) “English” names (ie typical names in English-speaking countries) come from various linguistic origins. I’m American and my first name comes from Latin, my middle name Greek, and last name Irish. My parents didn’t know anything about the etymology or meaning of the names. I had to look them up because they’re not obvious like Hunter or Smith. If my Japanese students ask for an “English” name, I try to go with something similar to their Japanese name, like Shimon -&gt; Simon. I don’t know the etymology off the top of my head, but it’s a common “English” name.

what kind of meanings your names have?  
what is the general tendency regarding how to name a child?(Whether the name must have a meaning or not)  
what is the most common names in general and more recently?

I know, in English it sounds dumb. But for some/a lot of Dutch people it also sounds dumb in Dutch.

But wasn't it a rule that if many native speakers speak in a certain way that that would become a new rule and a valid way of speaking a language.

linguistics,Revival Effort of an Endangered Language,"Wunya ngulum! So I was born and raised in South East Queensland where the Gabi-Gabi people Used To live. I had the thought a while ago that I should learn their language out of respect. After a bit of research I learned that while the Gabi-Gabi people are still definitely around, the language is nearly wholly dead; no speakers, very little recorded speaking, and I can only find one book pertaining to it and one of its dialects (the Butchala dialect, circa. 20 speakers), which I have found at the state library.
I am definitely not expecting anyone here to know a lick of Gabi-Gabi, but I was hoping that someone would be able to give some advice on how I might go about conducting a revival effort? For anyone outside of Australia, just know that the racism here is still thick in the air; a shocking amount of pakeha still consider the Aboriginal people to be animals, but that is a problem for another post. My point is that the culture, language, and history is not taught in schools at all, and so resources are dearth. 
I feel like if I can get my hands on all the material I find, and use it to start piecing the language back together, I can begin to learn it. I believe that if I can connect to the community, I can share my knowledge and give back to the people that once tended to the land on which I was born.
Thoughts? Advice? I'm honestly kinda stuck on this, it's very shunned to do really anything nice for aboriginal people, me being white and all, but I believe that if this can work, and the people can reclaim their language.

linguistics,When a foreign language makes it an obligation to determine something that can be left undetermined in your own language.,"It’s in the title. Have you ever come accross this phenomenon? Do you know what it’s called?

For example, if your native language is Polish and you’re learning English, you’re perfectly satisfied with the sentence: ""Cat is on table"". Of course, you’ve heard your teacher’s explanation, ""the cat"" means the only relevant cat in your narrative context, while ""a cat"" means one cat among many other possible cats. Same thing with the table. But it gets really puzzling and challenging when they insist that choosing between ""a"" and ""the"" is not only an option, it’s an obligation.

Now let’s look at an English speaker learning Polish, whenever they use an infinitive verb, they have to chose between the following: imperfective (for ongoing or repeated actions) or perfective (for actions that are complete or exhausted). And here again, the English speaker can’t just say ""I need to call my friend"", they also have to determine whether they mean ""to call"" as a complete action or as an ongoing action.

Now imagine that our Englishman and our Pole are learning Thai. When they use a simple pronoun such as ""you"" or ""me"", they have to determine the age difference and the type of relationship (hierarchy, familiarity) between the people involved. When they qualify or count a noun, they must add a classifier, which is some type of generic category word. Very often there are several classifiers to chose from. So you can’t just say ""we have two solutions"" (counted noun) or ""we have a good solution"" (qualified noun), you need to chose a classifier which in this case can be the word ""story"" (story works as a classifier for many abstract nouns) or the word ""path"". So basically you need to determine whether you mean ""solution"" as a story or as a path.
 
A Thai speaker learning English will probably find it both interesting and difficult to have the obligation to chose a tense every time they use a verb, since verb tenses are undetermined in Thai (although they can also be defined by adverbs).

Please note that I’m not refering to cases where a language gives you the possibility to be specific where your own language is vague, whithout forcing you to be specific, but rather to cases when that becomes an obligation.

3. Will the same code be applicable for the same function in a different sentence where the positioning of the keyword is different. For instance, ""Life has a different meaning in the mountains.""  Here life is located at the beginning of the sentence.",1620131034,phonomonal,1,127,776,122,24

linguistics,Perception of archaic English vs archaic Spanish in the fantasy genre,"Hello everyone! I am not a linguist and I am not sure if this should be asked here, if this is not the right place, just let me know on which sub I should ask:) 

Btw, I´m not an English native speaker and I will make some mistakes in this text for sure, I´m sorry in advance.

What I was wondering is, why more archaic forms of English look and sound so nice and kind of natural in fantasy books like Tolkien's The Hobbit or LOTR but the same doesn't happen in Spanish. I assume that for this question to be answered I will  need a linguist that is Spanish or has studied Spanish. Thing is, the fantasy genre spins around English, but I have noticed that there's not so much written in Spanish, and those books in Spanish are written in a completely modern Spanish. I feel like more archaic forms of Spanish are looked down upon. It sounds old, but in a bad way, outdated and kind of ridiculous. There are not fantasy books in Spanish that I know that are written in Cervantes Spanish style for example. They don't seem to sound epic in Spanish, while in English the contrary seems to happen and I don't understand why. I mean, Tolkien can use a lot of archaisms in his books and it is still appealing to readers nowadays, but I can't imagine a Spanish writer doing the same and succeeding. Does anyone have an explanation for why what works on one language doesn't work on the other?

In the transition between Old English and Middle English, all vowels at the end of words became schwa. In Late Middle English, these schwas disappeared. 

However, in monosyllabic words they were kept. Also, \[x\] and \[ç\] disappeared, thus allowing a few vowels to appear at the end of words, though due to breaking into a diphthong ending in /u/ and /i/ before \[x\] and \[ç\] respectively, the vowels are quite limited, with /a/ turning into /au/, which turned into /ɔː/. Also, /ij/ reduced to /iː/, creating a few more words with final vowels. 

The second and the third changes didn't allow ""a"" to appear at the end of words, and for some reason there weren't any monosyllabic words ending in ""a"".

linguistics,Single word vs sentence stimuli in multilingual speakers. How accepted is Michael Paradis on this issue?,"I'll quote from his forward in The Handbook of the Neuroscience of Multilingualism   
  

  ""Another widely applicable finding is that results cannot be generalized from single  
words to language in any study of multilingualism, including language lateralization,  
neuroimaging studies, pre‐surgical electrical stimulation, or diagnosis and therapy.  
Single words are the least likely candidates for investigating language representation,  
given that what makes language most specific as a cognitive function, namely the  
language system (phonology, morphology, syntax), is supported by procedural memory,  
whereas isolated words, being explicitly known form‐meaning associations, are  
supported by declarative memory and hence are less focalized in their cortical representation. Neuroimaging studies using single words as stimuli show no difference between  
monolingual and bilingual individuals, whereas studies that use sentences as stimuli  
do. Not only can results obtained with single‐word stimuli not be generalized to the  
representation and processing of language (in the way that one normally cannot  
generalize from a part to the whole), but experiments that use such stimuli address a  
component that differs radically from the language system.""

 * Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

 * Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

 * English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

linguistics,Is SEE (Signed Exact English) considered a language?,"Hello all. I have been in a thread elsewhere where I am debating whether or not SEE (Signed Exact English) is considered a language. Another user is arguing that ASL (American Sign Lanuage) is a language and SEE is not, whereas I am arguing that both ASL and SEE are languages. The interesting bit, and point of contention, is in regards to how the two respective languages came about. I am here because I am now interested to see and hear what the linguistic community has to say and if anyone has anything to contribute. 

I will let you know that I am a native ASL user, but a lot of my native ASL was lost and replaced with SEE, and as a result I sign a blend of ASL/SEE. Signing is not my primary mode of communication- I actually primarily use spoken English as my language of choice and will identify as an English speaker, although not a native English speaker. I am fluent in both English and ASL/SEE blend, and have basic understanding of Spanish. 

For the sake of this question, I would like responses that put aside how one feels about SEE, because the language itself is highly controversial, hated, and despised among the Deaf community- and that is whole 'nother can of worms- so if possible, please keep opinions on that issue out as much as possible.

ASL developed naturally among the Deaf community, evolving much in the same way that spoken languages developed. SEE, on the other hand, came about due to English speakers with knowledge of ASL deciding that a ""better' signed language was needed to teach Deaf the grammar of English, and thus believed they needed to address the wrongness of ASL because it didn't follow English grammar and conventions. So SEE was purposely developed and then forced upon the Deaf community at large, and in many cases was forced upon the Deaf to such an extent that native ASL users were told that their language was wrong and/or incorrect and SEE was the correct language- (similar to how Blacks were told that AAVE was incorrect English.)

I argue that given the definition of what language is- both ASL and SEE are languages, however, I recognize ASL as being a natural or true language- as it developed similarly to how all languages are developed among a group of people or culture. SEE however is different- it was not developed naturally among a group of people- it was developed by native English speakers for another community- the Deaf peoples, and then systematically forced upon the Deaf community as a whole.

I argue that SEE is a language, but not a true language. Interestingly enough, as far as I know- SEE is the only language that was purposely created with the express intention for it to be used by a community that didn't create it. SEE was created by taking ASL and forcing it it follow strict English grammar, syntax, and conventions. As a result, signs had to be modified and/or invented to cover such instances where something in English didn't exist in ASL. For example, the -ed ending in English doesn't exist in ASL, so a hand-sign was invented expressly for signifying -ed on a verb. Walk vs. walked.

I am going to link the comment thread that started the debate on ASL vs SEE as languages. Start at the 4th comment down, as the ones before it address the question the post asked and isn't very relevant to the ASL vs SEE question I am here about. ([https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/n2s9ro/jehovas\_witnesses\_are\_sneaking\_into\_my\_apartment/gwpp7ef?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/n2s9ro/jehovas_witnesses_are_sneaking_into_my_apartment/gwpp7ef?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) 

If you don't want to follow the link, here is the back and forth, copied and pasted:

**Me:** A lot of Deaf who are my age and were mainstreamed picked up that blend because ASL was primarily used in schools until the big push to strictly use SEE (which failed massively). My particular age group had enough ASL mastery and were forced to switch to SEE. As a result many recognized the benefits of SEE to English because of its literal translation of English to sign.

A lot of Deaf that I meet who do well within the hearing world regardless of whether or not they are able to verbally speak English have, to some degree, an understanding of both ASL and SEE. Nearly all Deaf that fall into this category tend to either be mostly ASL or verbal English users by choice.

Very few use ASL/SEE blend. And even less use straight SEE.

**Them:** SEE was only supposed to be used for teaching english - so sad that teachers / administrators have convinced hearing parents to force their kids to use it. and it hurts interpreters! 

it’s not even a language &amp; it’s certainly not grammatically correct.

**Me:** SEE follows English grammar and structure- so technically it is a language. It is a literal word for word translation of English in sign. SEE actually has tense and endings like English does (-ed, -ing, -ly) and requires strict adherence to English grammar rules.

As far as I know, it's the only language to have been developed and forced onto a group of people.

For example, both Spanish and English follow their own grammar rules. So they have their own structure to say the same thing.

English: I live in the grey house.

Spanish: Vivo en la casa gris.

What SEE did was to take the signs, and put them in English grammar &amp; structure to make sign ""correct"" and thus, it was like forcing Spanish to follow English grammar or vice versa.

Applying that to the Spanish- English example, it'd be like English speakers forcing Spanish language to follow English grammar rules and vice versa.

English: I live in the grey house. 

Force English to follow Spanish rules: I live in the house grey.

Spanish: Vivo en la casa gris. 

Force Spanish to follow English rules: Yo vivo en la gris casa.

Then to make it worse, they invented signs to add English that doesn't exist (or isn't used often) into sign. Tenses in ASL typically are indicated by spacial location of the word signed and context. Run/ran/running, for example, all use the same hand sign- and is literally translated into English as ""run"" no matter which tense it would be if it followed English rules.

Instead run signed close to your shoulder typically translates into the past tense ""ran"", run signed in front of chest area close to the body translates to the present tense- ""run"", and run signed in front of the chest area but further out from the body indicates the future or present progressive form of run- ""running/will run.""

SEE forced tenses into literal signs- required signs to add -ly, -ing,-ed, -er, (etc.) and wouldn't accept these to be left out because then the English was wrong. This slowed the signing down dramatically, so it took 2-3x as long to say the sentence as it normally would otherwise.

SEE does qualify as a language, and does have a set of correct grammar and structure it needs to follow. On that qualifier alone, SEE is a language.

However, SEE didn't develop on its own through culture and natural development by a people. SEE was developed by native English speakers who knew and understood ASL and decided that the grammar and structure of ASL was wrong because it didn't follow English rules, so therefore ASL needed to be corrected, and forced to follow English conventions.

Imagine if native English speakers knew and understood Spanish- but decided that the language was structurally wrong and went and told all Spanish speaking peoples- ""Hey- you're speaking Spanish wrong- you need to order your sentences like this..."" and then forced Spanish words to follow English convention.

The same thing happened with AAVE, African African Vernacular English. Black people were told by English speaking white people that their English was wrong- and tried to force the Black community to speak ""correct English"" because they didn't or couldn't recognize that AAVE has its own pattern, grammar, and structure.

**Them:** sorry, no, SEE is not a language. it’s a system, using morphemes from ASL &amp; grammar from english. \[and it’s ugly\]. it resembles a language, but has no internal structure; instead it is kitbashed together from 2 true languages, and unlike PSE, is unnatural. also, it is the choice of few Deaf adults, who do actually use the pidgen/contact system of PSE.

SEE-II is not considered a language itself like ASL; rather it is an invented system for a language—namely, for English. from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing\_Exact\_English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_Exact_English)

Signing Exact English (SEE) is a sign system that matches signs with the English language \[ from a page that lauds SEE - [https://www.handsandvoices.org/comcon/articles/see.htm](https://www.handsandvoices.org/comcon/articles/see.htm)

Signed Exact English is a system to communicate in English through signs and fingerspelling. Signed Exact English, in most cases, uses English grammar (that is, you are signing English). from: [https://www.signingsavvy.com/blog/45/The+difference+between+ASL+and+English+signs](https://www.signingsavvy.com/blog/45/The+difference+between+ASL+and+English+signs)

**Me:** I see your point on it not being a language. I'd argue that it is, since it does have grammar, syntax, etc. however, I recognize that it isn't a true language since it didn't develop naturally.

Language is complex, but if it has rules and conventions that dictate the ordering, I'd consider it a language.

Since a lot of research involving ASL and SEE focuses on how ASL evolved, the link between the two and its connections to English, pros/cons of SEE with applications to teaching the Deaf the English conventions, and/or how SEE was designed with a goal in mind- there is very little about debating whether or not SEE is a language in and of itself.

However, language develops over time, and the fact that a small portion of Deaf people have adopted the use of SEE in their daily lives, means that SEE had started to become a language, and is recognized as a language among the Deaf community.

Most Deaf recognize SEE as a language, albeit a very hated and controversial language due to the fact that it was developed and forced onto the deaf community as a whole.

It may not be recognized academically yet as its own language, but it is relatively new- an infant as far as a language goes.

Is it a viable language? I don't know. But the fact that SEE has continued to be used, and is still around despite the fact that it is hated and despised by much of the very people it was created for and forced upon doesn't negate that it meets the basic criteria for what a language is.

There are several definitions for language. But what makes a language a language?

Henry Sweet proposes that “Language is the expression of ideas by means of speech-sounds combined into words. Words are combined into sentences, this combination answering to that of ideas into thoughts.”

Bernard Bloch and George L. Trager proposed that “A language is a system of arbitrary vocal symbols by means of which a social group cooperates.”

[https://www.britannica.com/topic/language](https://www.britannica.com/topic/language)

Both of these define language in terms of relation to vocality- the use of voice and sounds arranged in a way to communicate.

Note, by those two definitions- ASL wouldn't be considered a language because a vocal component isn't part of ASL. Given that ASL has only just begun to be recognized as a language of its own- those proposed definitions of what is a language do struggle a bit.

Noam Chomsky defines language as “a set (finite or infinite) of sentences, each finite in length and constructed out of a finite set of elements"" and by this definition ASL qualifies as a language. Furthermore, this same criteria can be applied to SEE, thus SEE also qualifies as a language.

linguistics,What would a Malayo-polynesian Interlingua look like?,"Sorry if this isn't the right sub, but I didn't think that the conlang subs would be able to answer this as accurately.

For those who don't know, [Interlingua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingua) is an auxlang designed to incorporate the simplest grammar and vocabulary from mostly western european languages so that many speakers can understand it. It effectively functions as an oblique and heavily globalized romance language.

Now, Malayo-polynesian are incredibly varied. Some are more agglutinating, while others are borderline analytic. Hawaiian only has 8 consonants while Nemi has 43. There is a common root pattern (CVCCVC) that changes significantly between languages. Making a language that worked with all of these characteristics in a way that felt natural would be really difficult.

Lots of Malayo-polynesian languages also have a variety of foreign influences. Malay and Indonesian have Arabic, Dutch, and English influence, while Filipino has significant Spanish influence. I've noticed that native Malayo-polynesian words are seen as more informal than corresponding loanwords (aku vs saya for example). If you spoke a Malayo-polynesian reconstruction or Interlingua, maybe it would come off as uneducated or mean?",1619990440,Orangutanion,4,180,1241,53,7
linguistics,Recording of UNKNOWN spoken language. Possibly 'Ancient Sumerian'. Who can help with translation?,"Someone posted this in another thread as part of an investigstion into their friend's experience.

The summary, according to the person who recorded it is as follows:

A meditation session over the phone, between friends, with psychic channeling intents. At one point the person on the other end, a French male without any connection to the Middle-East or Africa started speaking this language during the call. He apparently spoke for a while, not as himself, but a being from somewhere else. When asked, the 'voice' said through the guy, that it is related to Ancient Sumerian.

The metaphysical aspects are just for context and irrelevant to this. The recording exists, and it needs trsnslation. I am not a linguist and it beats me. It would really help me, the uploader and the two people who recorded it... and maybe your own curiosity, if we could descifer it.

Notes:

• The words 'Enki' and 'Ra' are relevant in this context.

• I transcribed the recording best I could in a made-up syntax to make sense of it. It sounds like a poem. The rythm of recitation is also very 'greek poem'-like.

• A few words towards the end are too whispered for me to transcribe.

• There seem to be pronouns, and there seems to be a story to it.

Thank you very much for any contribution you could bring. The main questions are:

**What language is it?**

**What does it say?**

Herodotus, for example, [wrote (56-58)](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/1B*.html#56) about the Pelasgians and reported that the inhabitants of Placia and Scylace (in Ancient Mysia, so present-day Sea of Marmara) and of the 'city of Creston' (it is unclear if Creston referred to Kreston in Ancient Macedonia or to the Etruscan city of Cortona/Curtun) still spoke a non-Greek language, perhaps being or having originated from Pelasgian, during his times.

Hello everyone,

As my name suggests, I am deeply interested in languages. Chinese is my seventh which I started nearly ten years ago.

I have been spending some time trying to design a more consistent and efficient system of Romanising Mandarin Chinese with less letters and diacritics. I know this might seem a bit eccentric, and I have deep respect for both the Wade-Giles and Hanyu, but I am quite pleased with the result. I have got rid of &lt;w&gt; which, like Romance languages, is always represented by &lt;u&gt;, &lt;y&gt; which is always represented by &lt;i&gt;, and &lt;x&gt;, &lt;q&gt; and &lt;j&gt; because they are already palatalised allophones of &lt;s&gt;, &lt;c&gt; and &lt;z&gt; respectively. &lt;yi&gt; is just &lt;i&gt;, &lt;yu&gt; is &lt;iu&gt; and &lt;wu&gt; is also just &lt;u&gt;. I also turned &lt;ao&gt; into &lt;au&gt; to make it more consistent with the norm in European languages and its phonemic value.

The orthographical systems of Italian, German, Latin, Portuguese, Spanish, in addition to pre-existing pinyin systems, helped me create this.

This post is not an exhaustive representation of my system, but it can give you a feel for it.

**First tone** = double vowel (core vowel in diphthong), e.g. *maa*; *uaai*

**Second tone** = &lt;h&gt; final, e.g. *mah*; *uaih*

**Third tone** = acute accent + &lt;h&gt; final, e.g. *màh*; *uàih*

**Fourth tone** = acute accent, e.g. *mà*; *uài*

**Neutral tone** = no change, e.g. *ma*; *uai*

Example:

**Hanyu Pinyin**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**1.** Compose a coherent (Modern) English sentence at least five words long (without using proper names) that *consists entirely of* *non-native words and morphemes*.   
&gt;  
&gt;For the purposes of this exercise, we will count as “native” any English words that are traceable (according to AHD) back to a “Germanic root” (and that have not been borrowed into English), as well as words whose etymologies show a pattern “Middle English &lt; Old English”, whether originating in Old English (with no Germanic root specified) or descending directly from a specified Proto-Indo-European root (as in the standard type of “native” word discussed and illustrated in lectures).   
&gt;  
&gt;Note carefully the specification of non-native *morphemes,* in addition to non-native *words*! Thus there are some common native morphemes that you cannot use, including the following:  
&gt;  
&gt; • the verb ending *-s* that marks 3 sg. forms (“he/she/it” forms, like “he/she paints”, etc.). This means that even though *paint* is a borrowed word, you cannot use the actual form *paints* (as in “she paints”).  
&gt;  
&gt; • the ending *-(e)s* that marks plural forms of most nouns (like *cat**s*)  
&gt;  
&gt; • the dental suffix of “weak verbs” (thus a form like *painted* cannot be used, even though *paint* is borrowed)   
&gt;  
&gt; • the *-ly* ending (used to make adverbs; thus *clear* is borrowed, but *clear**ly* cannot be used)   
&gt;  
&gt; • the suffix *-ness* (used to make abstract nouns)  
&gt;  
&gt; • the negative prefix *un-*  
&gt;  
&gt; • the suffix *-ing* (in all of its meanings/usages)  
&gt;  
&gt; • definite and indefinite articles, including *a/an/the/some*

It’s just something I can feel. Even the most perfect English from Americans here, I can still hear small inflections or vowel changes in tiny words with people who speak other languages but have fluent English.

linguistics,From which Germanic language did German originate?,"Disclaimer: I know German came from Early New High German, which in turn came from Middle High German, which in turn came from Old High German. But the question I want to know the answer to is which West Germanic language did Old High German come from? Having done some research, this is what I can only conclude. 

According to some linguists, the West Germanic languages could be traced to three major branches: **North Sea Germanic** (Ingvaeonic), **Weser-Rhine Germanic** (Istvaeonic), and **Elbe Germanic** (Irminonic). Out of the West Germanic languages, German, which originates from High German, seems to be the most ambiguous in origin. 

**North Sea Germanic**: 

* **Anglo-Frisian**
   * English/Scots (languages)
   * Frisian (languages)
* **Saxon**
   * Low German (language)

**Weser-Rhine Germanic**: 

* **Franconian**
   * Low Franconian
      * Dutch/Flemish/Afrikaans (languages)
      * Limburgish (language)
   * Central Franconian \**classified as Central German (High German)*
      * Ripuarian (dialect)
      * Moselle Franconian/Luxembourgish (languages)
   * Rhine Franconian *\*classified as Central German (High German)*
      * Hessian (dialect)
      * Palatine (dialect)
   * High Franconian *\*classified as Upper German (High German)*
      * East Franconian (dialect)
      * South Franconian (dialect)

**Elbe Germanic**:

* Alemannic (dialect) *\*classified as Upper German (High German)*
* Bavarian (dialect) *\*classified as Upper German (High German)*
* Thuringian (dialect) *\*classified as Central German (High German)*
* Lombardic (language) *\*extinct; classified as Upper German* 

Based on this list, we can rule out the possibility that German originated from the North Sea Germanic branch. However, it gets more complicated in the Elbe Germanic and Weser-Rhine Germanic branches. In those two branches, we see an overlap between the Upper and Central dialects of High German. This means that Elbe Germanic and Weser-Rhine Germanic branches are not synonymous to Upper German and Central German branches of High German. 

* Elbe Germanic =/= Upper German
* Elbe Germanic =/= Central German
* Weser-Rhine Germanic =/= Central German
* Weser-Rhine Germanic =/= Upper German

Additionally, we see that different languages Dutch/Flemish, Afrikaans, Limburgish, and Luxembourgish share the same branch as some of the German dialects. Based on this information, I can only conclude that the German language is a hybrid between the Elbe and Weser-Rhine Germanic branches, or the Upper and Central branches of High German. But which is the correct categorization? 

Initially, I hypothesized that the Elbe and Weser-Germanic branches used to be the original categorization, but overtime, parts of these branches assimilated into one language (High German) as the German states were being unified under Prussia after Napoleon dissolved the Holy Roman Empire, hence a standard language was needed. This would mean that the whole classification of Central and Upper German came as a result of the creation of the standard German language, which, in this context, makes more sense to divide in such groups, as the Elbe and Weser-Rhine model would prove to be archaic and irrelevant for including other languages like Dutch and Luxembourgish (some Germans don't even see this as a separate language).

But then I checked the date Old High German was spoken (750 - 1050 AD). This completely debunked my hypothesis, as Prussia did not even exist then. Then I reformulated a new hypothesis that perhaps the assimilation of parts of the Elbe and Weser-Rhine Germanic branches was already occurring way prior to even the Holy Roman Empire (800 - 1806). But what event could have led to the assimilation of the two branches? Geographic contact perhaps? From my understanding,

""A language is a dialect with an army and a navy."" - Max Weinheirt.

This means that all languages are dialects that possess a political status, as they are enforced and protected by a government. As mentioned, some Germans don't see Luxembourgish as a different language, but instead a dialect of German. However, this notion that Luxembourgish is a language comes from the fact that Luxembourg is its own country, with its own political system, separate from Germany. Therefore, delineating the boundary between language and dialect is purely arbitrary. Additionally, languages and dialects flow in a geographic continuum. Someone from Berlin may perceive the German spoken in Switzerland or Alsace as a different language from German, but someone from Baden-Württemberg may think otherwise, as they all speak a form of the Alemannic dialect of German. It is all relative to proximity. 

The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 granted independence to most of the non-German speaking part of the Holy Roman Empire, including Switzerland, which is predominantly German speaking today. Did that mean that most of the head of the German states did not perceive Swiss German as a form of German? How come today linguist consider Swiss German to be part of Old High German? 

Based on the list, it seems that at one point, Dutch and some of the German dialects used to also be one language (Frankish). But overtime, they diverged, for some unknown reason, and the German Franconian dialects ended up assimilating with the dialects of the Elbe Germanic branch to form Old High German. But how come the Low Franconian dialects that became Dutch did not assimilate to become High German as well? We see Switzerland and Austria break away from the Holy Roman Empire, yet their main language are still considered a form of High German. Is the Elbe, Weser-Rhineland, and North Sea Germanic model just wrong? What do you think?",1619637726,Lissandra_Freljord,44,883,5714,50,7

linguistics,"[Serious] Is there a word for ""good"" colonialism?","I look at the modern world and I'm truly blown away by its - dare I say - beauty and abundance.

Historically, there has been so much war, starvation, brutality, and disease. Reading historical accounts of ANY nation you see violence, genocide, and slavery. 

I look at the modern world and its not even comparable. More people than ever before live in safety.  More people than ever before are fed. More people sheltered.

Then I look at the evidence and I'm forced to conclude that democratic capitalism played a large role in paving the way to this better future. Sure it has a history of violence, genocide, and slavery but i think its a logical error to blame democratic capitalism for those things. Those things existed before democratic capitalism. They are caused by human nature. If anything, it appears that democratic capitalism paved the way to LESS violence, genocide, and slavery.

Now we come to colonialism.

Sidebar: I'm not saying colonialism led to a better world. That would be to leave the baby in the with the bathwater. There are better ways for humanity to grow than to subjugate entire nations. We can see that now.

But spreading better political systems is good. Immigration and emigration can be good. Improving  countrys trade and access to resources can be good. Technology is changing rapidly (duh). But so is culture. A global culture is emerging. International awareness is increasing. Where an individual could only trust his countrymen 50 years ago, now people play games together around the world and share the same memes and news cycle. A global conscious is growing.

I believe this is good.

That is why I seek a word for ""good"" colonialism. If global culture is good, then its spread is good. If international community is good, then its spread is good. If a global conscious is good (I believe this will allow humans to fight even less, share more, reduce emissions, and understand our place in the universe more), then again, spreading it and growing it is good. 

So what is a word that captures this optimistic view of things?",1619583973,_Bad_Ideas_,3,353,2070,49,8

linguistics,How much closely did old tibetan pronounce the letters in the spelling of tibetan words (script or wylie)?,"In many ways, it seems likely to me that old tibetan did pronounce nearly all of them, as unusual as that may seem for modern Lhasa tibetan. But I met a native speaker who argues firmly against this idea and says that languages like ladakhi (who still pronounce many consonants that Lhasa tibetan doesnt) simply developed in a way that they started to pronounce those letters some day, while others stayed ""original and true to old tibetan"" which would essentially imply that old tibetan didn't pronounce the letters and simply added them in to distinguish homophones, but it makes no comments on why certain letters are silent and others arent, or how the silent letters affect vowel qualities (such as bod being phö) and tones in those tibetic langs that do not pronounce them, as opposed to those liek ladakhi who do (and dont have tones as well). Apart from this, the fact that some homophones are grammatically distinct forms of the same word (in the sense of verb tenses to be precise) and are written with distinct spelling for each form make me wonder if what the native speaker believes has any truth to it. And it doesn't help that the tibetan script was invented from brahmi, a highly phonetic script itself. Why would tibetans borrow such a script and use it completely differently from its phonetic values from the very start of writing their language? 

So how was old tibetan most likely pronounced, and what were the likely phonological changes, so that I may know if there is truth to what the native speaker believes or if it is just to be taken with a grain of salt?

I'm curious though, because if we always calculate the information of a word based on the probability of that word in a corpus, does this not assume that we, as humans, have access to probability distributions in corpora?

linguistics,Fluency vs. acculturation in pluricentric languages: Idiomatic expressions,"I was discussing this yesterday and thought it would be interesting to hear other people’s opinions. Basically, I was arguing that when it comes to pluricentric languages, it’s possible for someone to be 100% fluent, in any meaningful sense of the word (that is, in any sense that does not exclude any group of native speakers), without necessarily being privy to/able to understand all cultural references in wide usage in one or more countries where the language is spoken. In particular (and that was the critical point of the discussion), I was arguing it was true even when those references were crystalized in idiomatic expressions.

In English, for example, you have expressions such as “to hit/knock it out of the park,” which is exceedingly common in day-to-day usage in the US, but I strongly suspect there are native speakers who wouldn’t know what it means. After all, it’s closely related to sports (baseball in particular) that are not universally popular.

There’s a second group of expressions that have little or no cultural implications, but which I feel are particular to certain circles/industries, say,  business or higher education. “To take a holistic approach” would be a good example here. This is likely to be used in every English-speaking country, but only by some speakers.

Finally, there’s a third kind of idiomatic expression that I feel would be understood everywhere. “The light at the end of the tunnel” is an example of this kind: it draws its meaning from sensory experience, and traces an analogue to a situation everyone can easily conceive of.

 * Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

 * Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

 * Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

 * English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

 * Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

 * Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

 * Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

 * Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1619438420,AutoModerator,283,479,2771,97,17

linguistics,What is a word?,"I was talking with some people about a [conlang](/r/tokima) (**con**structed **lang**uage) and we ended up arguing over whether it was isolating or synthetic. Looking at Wikipedia ([[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_language), [\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolating_language)) didn't help, since classifying a language as either isolating or synthetic needed us to determine the word-to-morpheme ratio. I argued that in the conlang-in-question, each word was one morpheme and therefore the conlang was isolating. However, one of the people I was talking with argued that the division between words is purely orthographic, and since we couldn't determine a way of separating words that doesn't rely on orthography, we had no way of determining if the conlang was isolating or synthetic.

How do we determine what is a word without relying on orthography, and how do we determine if the conlang is isolating or synthetic?",1619424800,EkskiuTwentyTwo,3,133,939,15,4

linguistics,"Why do ""grammatical"" sentences in grammar textbooks sound weird?","I always had this question since I was a kid. In any book that focuses on grammar, the ""grammatical"" sentences sound stuffy and archaic. Some examples that I can recall are ""That he be a good boy is necessary"" and ""With who will you play?""

And it's not only the case of English. When I read a grammarbook about a language I'm fluent in, it's full with sentences that no actual speaker would write or say. There were always students who would ask how this is grammatical, and the teacher would often shrug and say ""Well, because linguists say so.""

I love semantic prime theory and NSM but it just doesn't make sense to me anymore, like at all.

linguistics,French rhotic,"Hi there. I've been trying to find out about the development of the rhotic in the 18 century, and found a lot of conflicting information online. 

Some claim it comes from low class dialects from as far as 17th century (referencing Molière), while most claim it came from upper-class trying to imitate the king's speech manners (seems like an example of folk linguistics to me). 

It seems though, that it did most likely first emerge in the upper classes. The accent of Incroyables and Merveilleuses is said to have ""a very weak, almost non-existing R"", which may just be how people, used to the alveolar trill, perceived the uvular sound (a trill of a fricative?)

So anyway, is there any concrete evidence on

- when and how did the uvular R emerge?

- what was its realization in upper-class accent in the 18th century after the revolution?

linguistics,"Looking for native speakers of Catalan, Sevillan, Basque, Czech or Polish to beta-test a Machine Learning conjugator.","Hi everybody!

I am looking for people who are are a native speaker of Catalan, Sevillan, Basque, Czech or Polish and are willing to beta-test the software, mlconjug3.

A couple of years ago, I made a [post to announce the release of mlconjug](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/bb8400/mlconjug_a_python_library_to_conjugate_verbs_in/),  a Python package/library to conjugate verbs (even made-up verbs, or verbs coming from slang and not covered in traditional conjugation tables) in French, English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian using Machine Learning techniques.

Since then, mlconjug has had a lot of success with thousands of students of foreign languages using it as a standalone application to improve their conjugation skills, but it has also been incorporated as a library dependency in more than a dozen different python software projects ranging from traditional NLP tasks using Machine Learning, to twitter bots, Voice Assistants, and even games.

It has also been used in several Academic publications, for example: [""Generative Grading: Near Human-level Accuracy for Automated Feedback on Richly Structured Problems""](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09916) where it is used for automatically grading students essays, and  United States citizenship exam questions.

I released a new and improved version of the software, called [mlconjug3](https://github.com/SekouDiaoNlp/mlconjug3) as it is only compatible with Python 3.x, and had many enhancements and bug fixes. The accuracy of the conjugations models has improved a lot and I am in the process of implementing regional European languages (in beta version for now), like Catalan, Sevillan, Basque language, etc... as well as slavic languages (Czech and Polish for now).

Those new languages should be available in the beginning of summer and I am looking for native speakers of the languages that are in beta status to test the software and check that the conjugated forms are correct.

You can install mlconjug3 from [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mlconjug3) or [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mlconjug3).

linguistics,Are phonetic rules considered as plagiarism?,"So, I'm an undergraduate student and I was given the task of comparing the phonetics of English and the phonetics of my native language. My paper wasn't too long (about 1000 words) but it was adequate and very informative. The deal is, in my paper I included lots of phonetic rules such as; ""Velar stop consonants have palatal allophones before front vowels"",  ""when y immediately follows a consonant, change the y to i and add es"" etc. These rules aren't anyone's own work, these are strictly common knowledge and can be found on millions of books, websites and so on.

As far as I know plagiarism is taking others' ideas, data, discovery, information and making it look like it's yours. This varies in different disciplines but generally if something is considered general knowledge or a common concept, it is NOT regarded as plagiarism.

Now, my paper was graded 54/100 by my phonetics lecturer. I e-mailed my lecturer to ask why, and he responded with this: ""You're homework has a lot of plagiarism and this is unacceptable."" He didn't specify exactly which parts were plagiarised but I am sure that it was the part that I included phonetic rules. I find this extremely unfair and I think he doesn't know what plagiarism is. He also depends only on the turnitin score and doesn't check the papers by himself to see if it's actually plagiarism. In the academic community it is well known that sometimes turnitin can be incorrect and the teacher always has the check the paper by him/herself to be sure.

But I imagine the features of an English accent in another language change in importance and relevance between the other languages. Isn't it theoretically possible that an English accent in another language - say Khmer - could actually have similar enough sounds as to actually *not* be very different from native speech of that language? I know the situation isn't true for Khmer, but I'm just throwing out a random language because I don't know any that it is true for.

Or is it the case that there's just too much possible variation and actual specificity in human language for what I'm describing to actually happen?

The word roots with **Ara** 'wheel', 'radius' etc. but the word **arya**\- 'master' 'lord', 'noble' so Europeans figured who else can be this and this is where the myth of ""European Invasion"" came about, and what this means is the mythical invasion of europeans into the East. This finally was dismissed in 1960's after the fall of radical Nazism, no one wanted that theory. But around the same time Mariua Gimbutas made a theory based on another popularity, PIE cult begins. See Europeans cannot fathom that language has spread form east to west. They read all these sound laws, and then called them Grimms law. This is to take away from Sanskrit. But essentially the theory of PIE is a HUGE CONFIRMATION BIAS. See PIE is a cult, it's not real. The reason there is an (\*) next to the word, is to let you know, its made up. That's right remade, recreated.After reading academic journals, you come to realize the flaws in these papers. This is especially true when comparing it to Sanskirt. There is a huge push to make words originate in Europe. These people have ZERO understanding of Sanskrit and the peer review conducted are conducted by people who have a superficial view of Sanskrit and don't understand it. So they cannot tell if the words in comparison are a real close match.

Let me show examples.(Cambridge Press, Indo-European Linguistics: An Introduction, James Clackson)Page 49  


|Sanskrit|Latin|Greek|English|Meaning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||\-fīdēs-|peíthomai|bide'|'trust'|
|budh||punthánō|bode|'make aware'|
|bandh|\-fend-||bind|'daub'|
|bāhu-||pēkhu||'fore-arm'|

&amp;#x200B;

**First** mistake, the Sanskrit column has no equivalent as stated by the author. The word in Sanskrit is actually **vad** 'affirm', 'declare', 'address' but really it means 'to promise' which equates to 'trust'. **Second** mistake is the Greek **peíthomai** is actally **peítho** \+ **mai** which actually means 'I know'. You can see this in Hindi, **pata** **me** 'i know' and can be the same as 'addressing'. These both come from Sanskrit, but not as 'trust'. And for those of you who are morons that think they aren't related, Hindi **kaise hain** 'how are you', Greek **geia sou** 'hello' and the exact match would be in Hindi **kaise** 'hey'. THEY BOTH COME FROM SANSKRIT. The meaning **trust** has even a better equivalent in Sanskrit, **dṛṣṭa** 'to make visible', 'visible', 'apparent', 'noticed', 'regarded', 'considered' etc. which is the same exact meaning of **trust** 'having faith', 'firm belief', but also in pronunciation because **trust** = **dṛṣṭa**.

**Third** mistake, 3rd row, **bandh** = bind which does confirm to english. The Latin **-fend-** comes form 'offense', 'defense', 'fend'(I'm sure I can find a better Sanskrit match). But the meaning is explained as **daub**. **Daub** is defined as coat or smear with a thick or sticky substance . The Sanskrit word closest to this definition is **tip** 'to sprinkle', 'ooze', 'to drop', 'to leak'. Not only are the wrong words used, but the wrong meaning is too.

Understand, as to bring out history, the British would hang signs ""*No Dogs*, *No Indians*"". They didn't even want the input of Indians especially when it came to linguistics. And lets face it. What the west cowardly calls ""Arabic Numerals"" hasn't even been corrected because its actually called Hindu-Numerals, as it was Al-Kindi who named his books ""Kitāb...al-Hindīyyah"" regard and give respect and credit to Hindus. And so far, no history books have actually corrected it. And whats audacious is they still think Greeks created mathematics, because of someone in history who made a narrative based on falsehoods. But instead of thinking it's Indian Nationalism, maybe Indians like people to understand there's ""European History"" based on bias, and then their's actual history based on facts. There is ""European Linguistics"" and there is ""Linguistics"" based on facts.

What is true is European Languages are flooded with a phenomena called ""Semantic Shift"", the meaning keeps changing. But that's why Caste system was actually created, to adhere and stick actual meanings of words as well as spelling, scholastic pursuits by Brahmins, Ksatriya- defend the borders and protect people, Vaishya are the merchants and create economy, and Sudras do physical work. Thousands of years ago it wasn't about supremacy, it was about how each did their work because each are vital for this ecosystem to work. Vedas says, Sudra are the feet, Vaisyas are the thighs, Ksatriyas are the arms and hands, Brahmins are the mind or brain, the eyes are of god; without one of these it cannot sustain and work. That was how each regarded one another, same respect in their own field.

I am writing a paper in Linguistics, and I'll prove everyday words in English are actually Sanskrit words, But also connecting it to other languages where it'll be mind blowing, so much so the cultic practices of Linguistic Reconstruction will most likely be disbanded, and we will shift our understanding.

linguistics,Saphir hypotesis,"Hello people, I am new to this subreddit.
I have read about the Saphir-Whorf hypothesis about how language can influence our thoughts and behaviours.

I found it very interesting, and I have a question I'd like to discuss: at what extent is Saphir hypothesis acceptable before getting too extreme and difficult to accept?

He'd got a valid point in stating that if there is a concept that my language doesn't have a word for, it means that I cannot imagine it. How could the ancient greeks have thought about the word Astronaut, even though the words for universe and sailor already existed? There were no space missions at those times, so it is possible that they couldn't imagine any related word.

Let's think about europe before 1492, tomatoes were yet to be introduced from America, europeans didn't have a word for Tomatoes because they didn't know about their existence, hence their language didn't need to label a concept no one knew anything about. As a result europeans could not imagine the concept of tomatoes because european languages didn't have a word for it.

I don't see how this statement can be denied, as as long as a language is not aware of a concept it cannot label it and explain it to its speakers; as a result, its speaker cannot imagine that concept.

linguistics,Caveman Speech,"Hi, I was wondering if there is any research out there about how speakers of various languages portray ""caveman speech""? By ""caveman speech,"" I mean how the language demonstrates what early or primitive language is supposed to sound like - as an example, in English, you might hear something like ""Me want eat berry!"" or something like that (obviously it feels ridiculous typing it out lol). Although the majority of the times I've heard ""caveman speech"" it has been in my native language of English, as I've begun learning other languages I've noticed that often times the ways that other languages attempt to portray caveman speech is often similar to standard English grammar and vice versa. So, for example, I've noticed that, if the language has a case system and/or conjugates verbs based on person rather than relying on pronouns, these aspects tend to be dropped in caveman speech - just like how they are already absent in standard English grammar. On the other hand, when English tries to portray caveman speech, there is a tendency to drop articles, copulas, and to rely less on do-support - all of which are absent in the standard grammars of many other languages. To be clear, I don't think that there is anything particularly special about English in regards to caveman speech; the only reason I have specifically been using it as an example is because, again, it is my native language and the one I speak most proficiently. I was wondering if there is any research on potential consistencies between the features of a language's grammar and how it goes about depicting cavemen speech.",1619055333,BossApprehensive2786,4,272,1599,14,2
linguistics,"Can't say ""come"" without suggesting ejaculation","&amp;#x200B;

A simple observationA simple observation

I've seen people choke up, pause, hesitate, and even dismiss the word completely from their vocabulary. A strange pattern. It's probably unconscious in most cases, but it's also one of those things you can't 'unsee'.

I must admitt I've been affected by this, so I always appreciate when people use it casually.

My dear norwegian friend agrees with the observation. The english word ""come"" is cognate with the norwegian word ""kom"". ""Are you coming?"" translates to ""Kommer du?""

She said the norwegian word ""kom"" is more inclined to suggest ejaculation, and that the english word ""come"" didn't have much of an impact. It depends on the language itself probably, or maybe the fact that english is her second language. I don't know...

But it's safe to say that a common denominator for languages are found within the meanings we attach to them. Both ""come"" and ""kom"" has undergone a strange semantic shift, and I have no idea how this evolution came about.

Any ideas?",1619045206,International-Cat176,1,170,1023,47,6
linguistics,Simple explanation for the English Subjunctive,"I'm learning Spanish, which uses the subjunctive quite a lot.

linguistics,Is there a reason why some languages have something like the Rhythm Rule of English and others don't?,"In English, the citation form of the numeral expression *twenty-two* has the stress contour in (1a), not the one in (1b).

    (1a)   twenty-twó
    (1b) * twénty-two

However, when one concatenates it with a noun bearing primary stress (´), the stress contour of the word changes. Specifically, there appears to be a retraction of secondary stress (`) to avoid stress clash: (2b) trumps (2a).

    (2a) * twenty-twò mén
    (2b)   twènty-two mén

This phenomenon is entirely absent in Spanish:

    (3a)   veintidós
    (3b) * véintidos
    (4a)   veintidòs hómbres
    (4b) * vèintidos hómbres

Why? Is it because Spanish is syllable-timed and English stressed-timed? Is it because English **A N** structures constitute a single domain for stress rules while the Spanish ones don't? Is there anything interesting to say about how languages class w.r.t having these rhythmic effects in their stress systems?",1619033635,hunapolzki,13,137,908,101,18

linguistics,The Japanese r sound,"Now, I'm pretty sure this question has atleast appeared once on this subreddit, but I still have to ask, how one would classify the japanese r sound.

-A [voiced alveolar tap ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_dental_and_alveolar_taps_and_flaps) [ɾ] (or also post-alveolar [ɾ̠])
-A  [voiced alveolar lateral approximant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_dental,_alveolar_and_postalveolar_lateral_approximants#Voiced_alveolar_lateral_approximant) [l] 
-A [voiced alveolar lateral tap](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_dental_and_alveolar_lateral_flaps#Alveolar)[ɺ]
-A [voiced alveolar plosive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_dental_and_alveolar_plosives) [d]

Those seem to be the main (and most common) ones. Ofc there's also more uncommon ones like: [ɭ], [r], [ɖ], [ɮ] and [ɽ](according to wikipedia), but those are less important. 

In conclusion, I wanted to ask for confirmation on whether or not this is correct (I figured this would be the best subreddit to do so).

linguistics,When are numbers part of a (specific) language?,"Hi everyone,

since some time I am wondering about the time when we can say that numbers are part of a language. So think like this: Arithmetics, counting and the like are not known in many language communities around the world. At some point, people from the outside came (missionaries, colonial officers, etc.) and brought the concept with them. Even if some form of counting was known before, many peoples have adopted a decimal system and integrated it into their language. 

Or another example: In a language I am doing currently research on, one of the speakers created a decimal system that works with native terms based on the model of English. But he and maybe some of his relatives are the only ones that use this system today. 

So I was wondering: What is the starting point? When can we say, oh now language XY has numbers, before it didn't have numbers? Note well: I am not talking about any type of quantification - of course people can always express concepts like 'some, nothing' or even singularity and plurality in one form or another. I am really talking about those things that symbols like 1,2,3,4,5,6... express.

I am especially puzzled by the fact that even in Indo-european languages - where we would think they all have arithmetics and numbers of course - children have to struggle many years through tough education to get them right.

So share your opinions, thanks.

Best,

When people travel to third world countries, there are many countries where, even though you won't know the local language; people will treat you with dignity and respect. There are countries like Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan etc. where people aren't trying to even rip a foreigner off, they are hospitable and treat guests like loyalty, even though many people there are poor, and have a hard time providing for their families, forget about supporting foreign guests.
