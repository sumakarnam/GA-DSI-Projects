linguistics,What is the female equivalent of emasculating or demasculate?,"WARNING: This discussion may be triggering for those going through gender change or similar 

In the context of traditional gender roles/behavior, it may be said that a man in his own home may feel emasculated if another man carries out his 'manly' non sexual duties. What is the word for this scenario with a woman? I seek input not in the context of duties of a sexual nature, but traditional feminine duties, such as to nurture or cook. I have researched and nothing seems to capture the essence that emasculating does for men. The closest, and seemingly new or coined words are:  defeminising and defiminate (spelling may be defeminate). But I am not clear, as I seek a word that is not related to physical alteration,  but more focused on usurping stereotypical roles. Outside of English,  is there such a word that is recognized and widely used in that language?

linguistics,I Feel Like a Different Person When Speaking My Target Languages,"Hello friends, and people soon to be friends! I am a high school senior and want to get my PhD in linguistics, not exactly knowing which field at the moment (kind of a pipe dream, but who knows). But anyway, to the topic at hand: “language split personality disorder” I would like to call it.

I learned Spanish throughout high school and always felt as if I was the most outgoing in that class specifically (I’m not an extrovert by any means, but more than usual), and never knew why. I started talking to different people in the online language learning space and realized I was not alone. Many people have this experience. 

With Russian, it is the exact opposite effect. I become very shy and reserved, and almost cannot speak it in public because of how anxious I feel before speaking. I do have general social anxiety, like I feel most people do because they are putting themselves in a vulnerable situation, but it seems heightened when I try to speak Russian. I know many people also have language-related social anxiety when they try to speak their respective target languages, however, Spanish is no issue for me. It could be that since my level is worse, I am more uncomfortable, but I honestly do not know. I can speak Arabic and Italian a bit, but not to the levels of my Russian and Spanish. I generally don’t because I don’t feel confident enough in my abilities to speak, although I’ve heard it is beneficial to start speaking early on and disregard people’s opinions of your low-level mistakes.

My reason for posting this is that I want others’ inputs on this phenomenon, hopefully from people with more knowledge on the subject than me. I understand the difference between linguistics and language learning, but feel this could pertain to both areas. I am very excited to read your responses! Have a nice day/night, everyone!",1618888471,espressochocolato,9
linguistics,"Question: is this a regional dialect thing, or a common way of phrasing? Linguistics, grammar, or arbitrary preference?","I’m a linguistic enthusiast who was born and raised in rural Mid-Michigan (hard ass glottal stop, o’s become ah’s, I basically talk through my nostrils, all that good stuff). I’ve noticed this grammatical tendency I have, and it kind of feels linguistically related to my other “Midwestern American” dialect traits. I could also be totally wrong, or at least way far away from the mark. That’s why I’m hoping for a second opinion. 

I’ll use an example because it seems hard to explain, at least for me as a rookie:

“I hope after the pandemic we can have in-person time together”

Vs.

“I hope that after the pandemic we can have in-person time together”

Vs.

“I hope after the pandemic that we can have in-person time together”

I usually say the first example if I’m saying this phrase. I’ve had second thoughts now and then when I look at the phrase and think “should I say ‘that’ somewhere in here?”

Could this be an element of midwest accents tending to omit a lot of words/sounds from their spoken English (I.e. “did you eat” becomes “dijeet”) or am I reading way too deep into this and I’m just using shitty grammar or something?

Would be super fascinated by any input! Especially if you happen to know a specific term for the deletion of words or sounds in the Midwest dialect.",1618886796,jesuscristmooperstar,3

You could talk to pretty much anybody that’s under 30 years old about memes and they would know exactly what you’re talking about. So when people are referencing memes, the language of meme culture comes out. You could say to someone, “mother trucker dude. That hurt like a butt cheek on a stick.” And they would most likely know what you’re referencing, and what you mean by it. Since most of the younger population of the western world speaks this way, would meme culture then have a pidgin language?

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

 * Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

 * Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

 * Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

 * Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

 * English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

 * Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

 * Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

 * Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

 * Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1618833616,AutoModerator,285
linguistics,Is lingthusiasm always so inaccurate?,"So, I listened to the first episode of lingthusiasm because I read about it in this subreddit, but I had to stop just after ten minutes. From two linguists I expected that they did at least some researches about the topic they were going to talk, or to check the informations they were going to say, but apparently that wasn't the case. 

I must say they were talking about Esperanto, and liking Esperanto myself I'm probably biased against the negative depiction they proposed, but that wouldn't have annoyed me, had the things they said been accurate.

The first wrong thing they said is that the esperanto word for hotdog is hotdogo. I can't find hotdogo in two of the main Esperanto online dictionaries (PIV and reta vortaro). It is in wiktionary though, but assuming it really was or is somewhat used it is at least an inaccurate claim, since the most used word for it is kolbasobulko.

But ok, that's not big deal, assuming that hot dog is a quite international word probably esperanto speakers would understand it. Now, coming to the utter wrong piece of information.

&gt;This is what 12 year old Gretchen did when she was encountering a  language. And so I got through chapter 1 which is how i learned the  word for 'and’ and 'dog’ and then I got to chapter 2 and I learned that all of the feminine forms were diminutive of the masculine forms. 

What? What does she mean? To form feminine words esperanto uses the suffix -in, but it isn't a diminutive, it is from the same german suffix. Well, it's incorrect but maybe she just didn't know that and she mistaken it for -ino, the italian (maybe also of other romance languages) diminutive.

&gt; so the word for men is like 'homo’ or something like Homo sapiens. And then the word for woman is 'homino’ (**Lauren:** boo) which is ’-in’ like the German -in suffix \[...\]  so first of all maybe this language is peaceful but it’s going to be a sexist peace.

Whaaat? Did she just really imply that the german suffix has something to do with the italian one? Is she just wrong or is she really wrong, thinking that similar words have to be similar origin?",1618828370,the_blue_bottle,80

the french that i speak is acadian french (north-east new brunswick to be specific), so it has some english influence on it, mainly in terms of vocabulary. however, i always pronounce those words like a french speaker when speaking, and it is voluntary. 

when i speak in english, however, i don’t do this. all the words i use are in english unless there is a concept that i cannot express with english words. until a few months ago. i was talking with some people who only speak english, and i said “i trouve that’s very interesting”. (i meant to say “i find that’s very interesting”). i then froze because the people i was talking to looked confused and i realized that i said “trouve”. i even pronounced like an english word (chroove) (sorry i’m too lazy to use ipa). i thought it was weird, but it happened again but with a different word. parle. i was speaking with my mother when i said “that’s just way i parle”. (i meant to say “that’s just the way i talk”. she speaks french as a second language so she understood. but i pronounced it like someone who didn’t speak a lick of french, with an english R and everything.

It's well overdue. I'm not necessarily saying it should be fully phonetic, as most of those look ugly, but there are a lot of inconsistencies that could be touched up and to stick to the current etymological spelling patterns.

We don't have a central language academy like other languages, not to mention getting all the English-speaking countries to agree to each change and implementing it.

linguistics,I sound extremely stereotypically homosexual and have no clue where I picked up the accent or why I can't lose it.,"I have always kept to myself, I literally don't have any friends outside of my family. Only one of them are gay (as far as I know of course) but she's a lesbian and she doesn't sound like a campy gay guy at all.  
None of my straight guy family members are feminine and speak pretty masculinely.   


I am and have been in the closet for most of my life but even before I realized I was attracted to men I was already speaking in a comically campy fashion. I am still in the closet and would very much like to not seem gay for some obvious reasons. I have no clue where I got this accent or how to lose it and am very confused by it.  


Everything I read about this voice makes it seem as if it's either gay men sticking around eachother and picking it up from their community or because it's a way to attract men (again, I've been doing this since before I even knew I liked guys.).

Neither of these seem right and both are actually fairly impossible. I doubt that this voice is some natural gay thing. I'm more just curious what you're guys' thoughts on this and if anyone knows how I got it but if anyone has any tips for sounding more heteronormative I would appreciate it especially since I've recently become unemployed and have some interviews in a few days.

linguistics,"How are ""non-English"" vowels perceived by native English speakers?","I came across a couple of studies that analyze how the different English vowels (AE) are perceived or analyzed by romance languages speakers (e.g. Spanish and Italian).

The point was that the phoneme [æ] was sometimes perceived as /a/ or /e, ɛ/ or [i, ɪ] as /i/ and so on, depending on context and environment.

However, I haven't found anything describing the other way around. For instance, if a romance language speaker - let's say Italian - says this:

[bät̪]

What would a native English speaker - let's say American - understand?

But? And thus [ä ~ ɐ]
Bat? And thus [ä ~ æ]
Bought/bot? And thus [ä ~ ɑ] (assuming a cot-caught merger)

I am curious to know if there are studies in this sense, or even personal experiences!

Thanks


Notes:

- I know that the context helps avoid any confusion, but for the sake of the argument let's not consider it.

- I know that [t̪] might be interpreted as /d/ because of the lack of aspiration. I also know that /t d/ are usually not released by AE speakers at the end of a word, and the difference is given by the length of the vowel. But again, let's avoid this.

linguistics,Period replacing slash for gender neutral writing,"Hebrew has two genders, male and female, and traditionally to adress mixed groups the male form is used. Until recently if you wanted to be more inclusive you would most commonly use a slash to alternate between the male and female forms so for example דרושים/ות drushim/ot ""wanted"" (drushim/drushot), את/ה at/a ""you (s)"" (at/ata), אתם/ן atem/n ""you (p)"" (atem/aten). For some reason, in the last year or two among young people increasingly a period is use instead of a slash, so for example דרושים.ות ""drushim.ot"", את.ה at.a, אתם.ן atem.n. This change struck me as strange and unnecessary, seeing that we already have the slash while the dot is quite jarring imo. Apparently use of the dot started in the gay community in order to include non-binary people as the slash apparently signifies exclusive or between male and female, but I doubt most users of the dot are aware of that origin.

TL;DR : I'm writing an academic paper that includes a classification system for different types of markings that music students might make in their music.

My question is about the markings that don't fit cleanly into a single category, such as a marking that has both graphical and textual elements. Is there a way in English to combine ""graphical"" and ""textual"" into a single word, like ""graphicotextual"" or ""textographical""?

linguistics,Pronunciation-dependent grammatical (?) correctness,"In Spanish, the singular of ""tamales"" is ""tamal."" The rule for forming plurals with words ending in a consonant is to add ""-es"" instead of just ""s."" 

In English, however, we don't have such a rule, so the singular of ""tamales"" is, in practice, assumed to be ""tamale,"" which you see a lot (wherever there's a lot of Mexican or Tex-Mex food, e.g., Texas; cf. [here](https://www.tamalehouseeast.com/).) 

""Tamale"" rhymes with ""tuh Molly"" (with an American accent).

So we have a situation where one word -- ""tamale"" -- is a correct formation if spoken with an American accent but an incorrect formation if spoken with a Mexican (etc) accent. 

Who cares, you might ask. Well, in Austin there are quite a few people who 1) don't speak Spanish, but 2) try to pronounce all Spanish words with an ""authentic"" accent (for whatever reason), resulting in malformations like saying the ""tamale"" in ""Tamale House"" with a Mexican accent. 

This is a form of hypercorrection (I guess) but ironically by pronouncing it ""authentically"" these people are actually rendering the whole phrase incorrect.

I also considered Welsh, cause there is a significant population in Wales that uses it in day-to-day life with other Welsh speakers. However, the community is smaller than Irish speakers

Irish is interesting cause it is the national language of Ireland. Trouble is, most people speak English in their day-to-day lives. So I am not sure where I could hear it or use it. I am also only a citizen of the UK, not ireland, so I couldn't spend that much time in Ireland easily.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you think? Scottish Gaelic, Irish, or Welsh?

Sometimes the sign language is swapped to entirely, and other times there is avoidance speech where there is a separate spoken lexical set. (Please correct me if I'm mistaken)

I suppose my question is mostly speculative as I'm not sure if any of these languages or any other (known) languages to fall under this idea but...

Are there any languages/or would it be a possible linguistic phenomenon to have a manually coded language in place of a typical spoken lexical set variation used during avoidance speech? As a possible sort of supplementary MLC?

There is Warlpiri, but that appears to have a full signed mode of the spoken language, versus just a subset supplementary system meant for avoidance speech...

On a secondary note, I recently reread Patrick Rothfuss's Kingkiller Chronicles and his language ""Adem"" has a combination of both spoken language and signed ""language.""

* Here is merriam-webster's definition:
   * Native speaker: a person who learned to speak the language of the place where he or she was born as a child rather than learning it as a foreign language 
* Here is wikipedia's:
   * Native language: a language that a person has been exposed to from birth or within the critical period.
   * Wikipedia also specifies: 

&gt;For many children whose home language differs from the language of the environment (the 'official' language), it is debatable which language is their ""native language"".

&amp;#x200B;

I was born to a bilingual mother and a monolingual father. My mother is french Canadian so I assume her ""native language"" is french, but she speaks fluent English (with a ""standard north-american"" accent). My father is French and his native language is French as well.

I am also a TCK (third culture kid) and grew up in mostly English speaking countries. I was born in Quebec but moved to the UK when I was roughly 6 months old, and I have been speaking English and French ever since. I was raised by a British baby-sitter as my parents weren't all that much at home to take care of me. I was then taken care of by a Kiwi (New-Zealander) baby-sitter when we moved to Australia. I have a standard north-american accent as a result of my mother who also spoke English to me from time to time, and presumably as a result of the numerous American schools I went to during my childhood.

I think in both languages. However, I do have a **slight** preference for English which seems a little more straightforward to me. This unfortunately, is a hugely subjective assessment of my language skills.

* Is it possible for someone to have multiple native languages?
* Can a child possess a native language his parent's can't speak?

For instance it seems they'll use it far more when they mean they don't know, and it doesn't feel to me like it's as emphatic as when in English we say 'no idea'.

I guess my question is, is this anything? Even if there is no real distinction between *Keine Ahnung* and *no idea* and I've imagined a difference in frequency:

linguistics,What's the best way of measuring the amplitude of a frequency?,"Hello Linguists,

I'm currently working on a project which requires me to measure the amount of energy allotted to certain frequencies in a voice recording and then compare that with other recordings. So, for example, I might want to find the amplitude of the fundamental frequency (aka A0) in one person's voice and compare it with other people's.

The obvious trouble here is that these amplitudes are relative to how loud the overall recording is, how far the speaker is away from the microphone - and this makes it pretty fruitless when comparing one recording's A0 with another's. So I wondered, is there a way of correcting for this? My first thought was to sum up all the sound power values and then divide each one by the overall value, but that doesn't make sense since some of these values are negative, so I could end up dividing by zero. Then I thought about finding the overall intensity of the recording via Praat and dividing each sound power value by that, but I'm not sure if that works either. Can anybody put me right here?

For context, I currently sure this script to get the sound power value for each band in a recording, incrementing by 200Hz each time.

    select Sound 'name$'

linguistics,The perception of palatalization in speech,"I have been interested in the topic of palatalization a lot.

A year or so ago, I heard the creator of Interslavic talking about the dialects of IS used by different actors. For example, he said that the priest is using the less-palatalized version of IS to sound more serious and educated while the common men use more palatelized style and sound ""softer"".

He is certainly not alone who perceive this thing that way. I have it similar.

Perhaps it's because of the church or Latin, but when I hear street pronounced as shtreet etc. it sound unpleasant/lazy/uneducated to me. I know, it's not right, but I feel it that way, what ever the cause for this feeling may be.

Also, if I observer people like Richard Dawkins, he prefer to say species like spiesies and not speshies. And there are more examples like that when, especialy with the sh sound.

Is this perception of less palatization = more education universal or not?

Or is this only associated with certain language families?

linguistics,“I don’t have any pronouns”,"  

TL;DR Some people are saying that they don’t want to be referred to by any 3rd person pronouns. Is this tenable in English? 

Hello all,

I wanted to post something in this thread to get some linguists’ thoughts on something I’ve been thinking about. I recently got into a regrettably heated discussion with someone about pronouns. Essentially, we were discussing gender-neutral pronouns (the singular use of *they*) and ‘neo-pronouns’. Having studied at a University with a significant LGBT community I was familiar with both concepts; the singular use of *they* and neo-pronouns. Both of which I am completely fine with, incidentally.

However, this person asserted that it is legitimate for a person to not go by any pronouns at all. My immediate reaction to this was that I thought it was completely nonsensical. I do not understand how someone can expect others they converse with to completely avoid 3rd person pronouns when interacting with them. I tried to explain why I thought this would be near impossible and badly hinder communication, but the person I was talking with became very irate and upset.   
Far be it from me to deny a person’s gender identity or ridicule someone attempting to discover something about themselves which I presume must be very difficult and delicate. However, from a purely linguistic stand-point I had some issues with this ‘no-pronoun’ business. Here are my thoughts:  
 

\-First, I think in discussions around gender-politics many people have an erroneous conceptualization of pronouns, and language in general. You do not, as a speaker, **own** any pronouns. The 3rd person pronouns with which people refer to you are the contents of your interlocutor’s speech. There is nothing you can do, outside physical force, to make someone refer to you in a certain way. Now, that is not to say that social convention and common courtesy don’t come into play and an individual can request that others refer to them by specific pronouns. But thinking of the 3rd person pronouns which people use to refer to you as **yours** or your property/part of your identity, is silly and wrong.

\-Secondly, pronouns have a very complex grammatical and social function in the sentence. You cannot do away with pronouns and continue to communicate fluently. They make up &lt;1% of your vocabulary but up to 30% of spoken language. They are unbelievably important little units of language which entail agency, gender, grammatical relationships and other complex sociocultural cues. The person who I was debating suggested that instead of referring to someone with pronouns you could just use a nickname. I tried to point out that a proper noun cannot replace a pronoun in all instances.  
 How does one account for subject and object pronouns? Consider:  
   
 

**He** wants me to give **him** a present.  
**Bob** wants me to give **Bob** a present.

Does that make sense? Maybe. But it’s certainly clunky and unwieldy. And if you were to try and write extended prose about someone with no 3rd person pronouns? It would be unreadable!   
 What about reflexive pronouns? Possessive pronouns? These questions need to be answered.

\-Third, why have we arbitrarily decided that 3rd person pronouns are unacceptable? Why not 1st or 2nd person? Shit, why not insist that people can’t refer to you with prepositions, articles or fronted-adverbial phrases. This goes back to thinking of language as **belonging** to you. If you can choose your pronouns, why not choose all other parts of speech?

\-Their argument was that this is “natural language evolution” and any attempt to question the utility or functionality of no-pronouns is akin to hatred and bigotry. My point was that this **isn’t** a natural use of language, nor is it natural language change. Change in language, especially grammatical phenomena in closed-linguistic categories like pronouns, occurs over many decades or centuries. New pronouns are not coined every day. 

Anyway, I think recent developments in gender politics have brought up some very important issues which need to be discussed. Trans people need to be protected and supported and if being transgender also necessitates changes in language and how we refer to people then I’m all for that. For example, using *they* to refer to a single person in a gender-neutral way I think is logically sound and a natural use of language. However, I do not think a person can do away with all 3rd person pronouns and continue to function as a partner in a conversation. Language, after all, is about communication.

linguistics,Any linguists out there that have ever thought on (Semantic) Linguistics’ effect on political affiliation?—and how learning form is or isn’t involved?,"One thing I’ve always noticed is that in U.S. politics, there is general trend in political language used: **People who associate with the right tend to refer the U.S. as the United States**; (technically the same thing duh) while people on the left tend to refer it as the U.S.. Also, orators with any assumed sense of a belonging to a political party tend to say America instead, when intending direct or indirect persuasion (i.e. *Make America Great Again* or *America is back*)

Notice the conundrum on how to choose the form of establishing my bolded quote above? e.g, to paraphrase myself and my intended message: 

“people who associate [enter word form here] as the United States”

From a strictly linguistic perspective, is there any consensus on how and/or why to fill those brackets? It’s almost got a paradox vibe I swear. There are accepted grammatical forms that nullify need those brackets at all, given the context of the quote, but still. 

To extend this further, the other thing I wonder about is if and/or when learning is involved in its usage. For reference, I am left-wing. Also for reference, I don’t recall ever really learning form in grammar school—I’ve always spoken English like the rest of my family, but when I moved from an army/diplomat bubble base; in Bangkok, Thailand btw; to Washington D.C., the scheduled curriculums didn’t match up and I basically skipped a class. (I fended for myself lol) 

Anyway, any linguistic insight—and NOT political insight—on this subject would be appreciated, as this enigma has been nagging me for a while now. Sorry if reading this made your brain hurt... or my deadass liberal punctuation. Writing this certainly did for me. 

tl;dr I’m deadass tired and very done with dealing with politics, so I call all and any linguists to save me from this agony; maybe a scholarly source on the title matter, if any exist? Popular/normal opinion is welcome too ofc",1617794888,MonkeyType,15

Is it just me or does the appeal of the Romance languages just not make sense! In my opinion I don’t find Spanish or Italian to be terribly pretty. Maybe it’s some other attractive term but it’s most definitely not pretty to me. French can sound nice at times, as well as Portuguese. However I find languages such as German, Norwegian, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese much prettier. I don’t even know if I would consider Mandarin to be “pretty” per se, but I like listening to it and it’s definitely not ugly. Spanish isn’t ugly either y es divertido hablar, ¡seguro! I just don’t understand the beauty and romance that it’s associated with. It sounds very, for a lack of a better term, choppy. Or “staccato,” which is a term used in music which indicates that the notes are played more sharply and detached. The Google definition: “performed with each note sharply detached or separated from the others.” Examples: “desayuno” o “computadora.” Now I know it DEFINITELY depends on the accent. I like the Puerto Rican accent, I believe they omit/aspirate the “s” pronunciation in their words. I love how it sounds and it’s interesting to listen to. Probably because it sounds less staccato! Perhaps that is part of why Portuguese sounds nicer. Portuguese does not have any rolled r’s either but it still has plenty of flapped r sounds which is preventing me from finding it very beautiful although in samba it sounds so smooth and pretty. Anyway, although it’s fun to speak, I think it may be the flapped r’s in Spanish and Italian that I don’t like. But at the same time it completely depends on the other letters in the word. Por ejemplo, “Fotografía” is the sexiest word ever, but “la computadora” just sounds so choppy. Japanese is pretty staccato too but the pronunciation of the words are different so it’s still pretty. As for French, it just sounds gross most of the time to me LOL. But the languages I listed prior just never sound bad to me! They always sound lovely. Thoughts? Opinions?

linguistics,When Was French Spelling First Standardized?,"If you look at the Oaths of Strasbourg from 842, which was written in a dialect of Gallo Romance, it looks a whole lot like Latin, (not necessarily words, but at least the spelling) yet many reconstructions and recordings have it pronounced a lot differently than it looks (which makes sense considering it was hundreds of years after Classical Latin. But half a century later in 880, the Sequence of Saint Eulalia was written (Very early Old French) and it looks a lot more like modern French. Of course there are still many parts that look like Latin: Buona pulcella fut eulalia = Eulalia was a good girl.
However there are also parts that look more “French” or at least less like Latin: Elle no'nt eskoltet les mals conselliers = She does not listen to the evil counsellors
So what I conclude from comparing these two texts is that Gallo Romance/French/Early Old French/Langue D’oïl or whatever you want to call it was standardized somewhere between 842 and 880. Does anyone known if this is accurate, or can anyone correct me?

linguistics,Orthgraphic perspectives of speakers of languages using Brahmic-derived scripts,"So, this might be a bit of an oddball question and bordering-on-tech question (so if there's a better reddit, happy to delete and repost elsewhere), but in Latin/Cyrillic/Greek/etc, you have miniscule and majuscule letters. When searching text, it's generally considered useful to offer a case-insensitive option, such that searching for ""red"" matches ""RED"".  

Similarly, in those scripts and many others like Hebrew or Arabic, you have diacritics, and for similar reasons, it's seen as useful to offer a diacritic-insensitive option, searching for ""resume"" would match ""résumé"".  (Obviously, I'm speaking broadly at a script, rather than language level here).

In Brahmic-derived abugidas, vowel indicators are … kind of half letters half diacritics?  Unicode actually acknowledges this oddity by classifying them separate to regular letters or diacritics.  Unfortunately, I don't read or speak any of these languages.

Generally speaking, are the vowel indicators (which in some cause substantial shape changes) seen more as letters or as diacritics?  For instance, in Hindi, if typing in *हनद* into a search bar, would a speaker expect to find *मानक* ***हिन्दी***? Or in Burmese, would searching for *မန* be expected match the beginning of ***မြန်****မာစာစကား*?

The reason I'm asking is I'm helping to improve the text-handling specifications for a programming language I work with it, but since mark-insensitive searching isn't common, I'm curious what the best overall approach is/what speakers of those languages contemplate as a letter. 

(Technically, I'm also curious about some other scripts that are encoded in Unicode similarly to the Brahmic-derived scripts like Pollard/Miao, but the Brahmic-derived ones are the clear majority but by number of scripts and number of speakers, so I'm looking at using them as a basis for how things are handled by default).",1617742458,alatennaub,32

I am currently working with child's productions at age 4;6. I noticed that the child frequently produces initial cluster of fricative + labial as (bilabial) stop + glide. Here are some examples:

linguistics,Trying to figure out a term/name for this concept of English formality,"Is there a name for the linguistic study of English when it comes to changing a sentence for politeness and nuance?

Or how it’s preferred “I’m not really understanding your point.” Rather than “I don’t get it.” 

And I understand changes in environment will affect this especially etc. but... 

Why and how do native English speakers naturally know to make these adjustments? The nuances I guess of sounding like a jerk or strangely blunt.

&gt; It is also difficult to be precise about the areal affinity of PIE, the other old inner Eurasian language family, because its spread obliterated all of its sisters and near neighbors. In the broader Eurasian perspective it appears to be more Eurasian than Near Eastern or Anatolian and to be more western than eastern ([**Nichols 2007**](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-linguistics-011619-030405#)). It may be relevant that although the Saami branch had no direct contact with Baltic and had close contact with Germanic only after its spread across Scandinavia and after at least some differentiation of its major branches, Saami appears to show much the same degree of westernization as Finnic, which was in close contact with Baltic and Germanic from the early stages of its westward spread ([**Grünthal 2012**](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-linguistics-011619-030405#), [**Junttila 2012**](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-linguistics-011619-030405#)). Western features include loss of object indexation in the verb, attrition of possessive person inflection, and development of a personal pronoun paradigm whereby the root carries person-number meaning and the inflection marks only case and not person. ***The westernization in Saami may suggest that the extinct pre-Saami substratal languages were also of a western type and that, therefore, their grammatical influence on Saami was similar to that of Baltic and Germanic on Finnic. This would mean that at least some non-IE languages of Fenno-Scandia belonged to an areal type similar to that of IE.***  

Emphasis my own

I've seen the list of suggested substrate words put forth by Ante Aikio and others (and also know that the list may be shrinking rather than growing, like the once-popular Germanic substrate hypothesis) but I was wondering if there were any suggested sources to read more about the possible ""western"" grammatical or phonological features of this language/these languages, even if a full reconstruction is obviously impossible.

linguistics,Cart-cu[t] merger,"Various sources, among which Geoff Lindsey’s recent book “English After RP,” refer to the fact that vowel length has become phonemic in contemporary accents of (Southern) British English.

I’m interested in the possible mergers (or, better stated, neutralizations) that may therefore originate due to pre-fortis clipping. The START vowel, for example, is one which Lindsey points out may have a quality very similar to that of STRUT in the South of England, with quantity serving as the main distinguishing factor. A logical implication seems to be that a word like “cart” could potentially sound identical to “cut” (or perhaps identical to a pronunciation of “cud” with final consonant devoicing), but for some reason no comment is made about this in any of the works I’ve checked.

From what I understand, in both the Indo-Aryan and Iranian branches, split ergativity arose from use of a participle construction where the agent was marked with some different case (Genitive in the Iranian branch, I think) and this eventually led to an aspect or tense based split ergativity. What I'm confused about is how person marking arose within the Iranian branch. From what I understand, the Indo-Aryan branch still uses a sort of periphrastic construction with a participle and copula or something like that, and the participle is only marked for gender and number, which makes sense, but in Persian and Kurdish, there's person marking on the past tense verb, despite being derived from a participle.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

 * Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

 * Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

 * Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

 * Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

 * English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

 * Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

 * Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

 * Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

 * Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1617624013,AutoModerator,208

Some examples I can think of:

**Umami** (20th century / Japanese), an entire category of taste related to monosodium glutamate (MSG), sometimes described as 'savoury'.

**Schadenfreude** (19th century / German), taking pleasure in another's misfortune.

Quick background, the topic of my thesis is about creating a computer algorithm, that when shown a voice clip of a speaker and some text as input. Will then generate audio of whatever the input text is, with the voice characteristics of the speaker audio sample.

So here's my question, are there any English sentences or paragraphs that when spoken, would satisfy the following criteria? Both of which are on a spectrum, and I know that a completely perfect sentence/paragraph is impossible, but I would love to hear some thoughts, and the more accurate a representation of the spoken English language the better.

1) Roughly equal distribution of letters compared to what an average English sentence would be? (Meaning, if the most used letter in spoken English is ""E"", then ""E"" should also be the most used letter in the proposed sentence/paragraph.)

2) Contains areas in the structure where characteristics of voices can be displayed. Accents, age, gender, levels of bass, etc.

Because the sentence would require reading of the speaker, and due to the nature of the algorithm, I'd suspect that it has to make grammatical sense and be somewhat natural for the speaker to read, but other than that, it absolutely doesn't have to make any sense and could be several disjointed sentences.",1617562953,InvalidFate404,3

Not a native speaker of English but I’ve been here for quite a while and still don’t know why Y is sometimes a vowel.

linguistics,Which language is actually the hardest to learn?,"We all know the common answers to this question: Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, etc. However, these list only consider a select few languages out of the 7,000 that exist. 

Today, I'd like to ask for input from each of you. Let's assume we're talking about a native English speaker. Additionally, let's not consider available study material and other learning resources. Instead, is like to just focus on linguistic difficulty. 

Here are some of my top choices:

Xoo(Taa) - Botswana and Namibia
The most unique sounds of any language known within the linguistic community(130 or more), 20+ clicks, and 4 different tones. And like all the other languages I'll list, Xoo is not a member of the Indo-European language family, so it's vocabulary would be quite distinct.

Tundra Nenets - Russia
As far as I know, this language has the most moods of any in the world(16). Additionally, it uses the Cyrillic alphabet, and additional challenge for English speakers.

Navajo - USA
Navajo has a strong combination of difficult features.  The language shows both agglutinative and fusional features(just like English), has 3 forms for stop consonants(creating lots of new sounds), 2 tones, and 7 grammatical moods. 

Greenlandic - Greenland
A polysinthetic language(one word can be an entire sentence), greenlandic would be quite the challenge. Plus, it has lots of fun velar and uvular consonants.

Guugu Ymithirr -Australia
An indigenous language famous for using cardinal directions instead of an egocentric directional system. So you're standing ""east of me"", not ""in front"".

Cantonese
Although I've been critical of well-known languages getting all the attention, the Chinese writing system is possibly the hardest in the world to learn. Cantonese has more tones than Mandarin(6 v. 4), so I chose it.

So what do you think? Which language is hardest, and why?",1617495577,EndlessExploration,17

linguistics,An idea for a generator that could produce titles for movies songs etc. (might be wrong subreddit),"So I visited [this wikipedia site](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/PG/2006/04/1-10000) and I saw the word count next to each word and I thought:

What if we took the frequency of these words in the English language, made a generator (I figured out that putting the words in triangular formula was the best way to simulate a frequency kind of generator)

the (6-10)

of (3-6)

and (1-3)

to (0-1)

in (0-0)

But instead of a completely random word generator based off ranking we could use those word counts.

For example:

In (used 5 times in a large paragraph, therefore 0-4)

To (used 10 times in a sentence, therefore 4-14)

And (used 15 times in a large paragraph, therefore 14-29)

Of (used 20 times in a sentence, therefore 29-49)

The (used 25 times in a sentence, therefore 49-74)

and so on. Generating from these types of frequencies would be the best way to go instead of [simple random word generators](https://randomwordgenerator.com/) or [title generators formatted restrictively](https://blog.reedsy.com/book-title-generator/)

An example of a sentence generated from those 5 words (keep in mind the generator would be huge to fit the 4000 words and their millions of uses on the wikipedia site. And if the numbers are too large then we could simplify it by dividing it by 10s) would be:

And The And The In To Of The To In

This might've been done before but oh my god this would be literally anyone's dream, especially mine. Because the generator would generate gramatically correct words or even sentences most of the time. I tried basing it off rankings but I came nowhere near close to common words, not a single the (keep in mind getting a the was 0.00025% chance of the 10,000 words I had, even with triangular formula frequency), and most of the words were randomly jumbled sentences.",1617480766,ZealousidealBody2,3

linguistics,Do phonemes carry any articulatory/phonetic information?,"I always assumed phonemes were the abstractions defined by their contrasts with other phonemes, and the (allo)phones had all the phonetic information. In my head, it kind of follows that phonemes themselves shouldn't imply any phonetic information. I get why English phonemes are often described in terms of articulatory information, but I always assumed that was just scholarly convention for ease of reading. 

But sometimes I see statements people make which seem to stem from this convention, which are actually meaningless (if my analysis of phonemes is right, which it probably isn't). For example, the Wikipedia page for Pirahã says that, depending on how you analyse it, Pirahã either lacks velars or lacks nasals. This is clearly a statement about phonemes, because Pirahã regularly has both velars and nasals allophonically. This implies that there is some sense in which phonemes can be 'nasal' or 'velar.' 

I've also heard people talk about the glottal stop in some English dialects as being 'underlyingly' an alveolar stop, because that's how that phoneme is normally realised. Is the phoneme actually 'an alveolar stop phoneme', or would it be more accurate to say that the phoneme itself carries no articulatory information, but it's usually realised allophonically as an alveolar stop? 

Do phonemes carry/imply phonetic information, or is this just some Wikipedia user taking the convention a bit too far?

linguistics,Does English have 4+ grammatical numbers? 1 apple. 2 apples. Half AN apple. Three fourths OF AN apple.,"Traditionally, people say English has 2 numbers, singular and plural. You use singular when there's 1 of something, and plural otherwise.

The problem is when you have a non-integer number of things. Here are some examples:

Half an apple

Half of an apple

One half of an apple

Three fifths of an apple

Three over five apples

Point six apples

The square root of two apples

Negative one apples (maybe negative one apple? this is definitely marginal)

As far as I can tell, the rules for ""pluralizing"" non-integer quantities of a noun depend on how you express the fraction. If the fraction is something like ""four fifths"" or ""seven halves,"" you say ""NUMBER of a NOUN."" If the fraction is .5, and you express that with simply the word ""half,"" you say ""half a NOUN."" ""There's half a chicken on the table."" Otherwise you just use the plural.

In ""I ate three fourths of an apple,"" the best devil's advocate I can think of for why that doesn't constitute another grammatical number is that the thing you ate is ""fourths of an apple,"" and you ate 3 of them. I think the argument kind of falls apart when you let the denominator get huge. You still say ""I ate 281/747 of an apple,"" but it doesn't *really* feel like you ate 281 of something. Plus you're not going ""mmmm, 747ths of an apple. Gonna eat 281 of these"" You're going ""mmm, apple. Gonna eat 281/747 of this.""

Basically, I grew up in a rural area in a remote part of the country, and I grew up speaking the local dialect/accent obviously. I guess this is my ""native language"". 

I later moved across the country to study at a university in a major city. My accent stood out so much people would regularly turn around to check who was speaking. It was awkward so I quickly started to remove all hints of my accent. I also think I naturally adapted to the sounds of my surroundings, and simply adopted that city accent as my own.  Nowadays people often guess I'm born and raised in the city where I went to school. My original accent would usually slip out if I was tired, drunk or spoke with someone from my hometown. 

I get confused looks if I mention I'm from [my hometown] because there's an expectation of an accent I don't speak. 

A few weeks ago, I joined a discord and on voice chat I heard someone speaking with the accent of my home region, so to let him know we were from the same place I spoke to him in my original accent. Not speaking the same dialect when we were clearly from the same place felt weird. 

Things kinda spiralled, I've been on that discord a lot in these last few weeks and I always speak my original accent, but I'm fairly conscious about doing so. I'm actively choosing which dialect to speak. And now I'm... Not sure how to explain I don't normally speak like this?

But the result of this has also been that I've been flooded with more thoughts of my hometown, childhood memories, I've reached out to more people from back home and I've reintroduced those language sounds into my life. I also question why I needed to remove the accent when I was younger, and feel a sense of remorse for washing away my identity and background. I now feel a connection to my roots when I'm speaking my native dialect and I feel like that's how I should speak.

It's now gotten slightly more difficult to switch between accents and I've started using my original accent a lot more at work, on autopilot, which has raised eyebrows and I haven't been able to explain why I do it.

I guess my questions are a mixture of philosophy and lingustics, but eh... How do I know which accent is my ""real"" one? Is my original accent still ""mine""?

Hello. I am hyunwoongko who is studying natural language processing. In many Asian languages such as Chinese, Korean and Japanese, the pre-trained sequence to sequence model is necessary, but it is currently lacking.

So I made Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and English Bart models by pruning the embedding layers of the facebook mBART model. The mBART model is a multilingual language model with 25 languages. However, if we only need one language (e.g., Japanese), the mBART's vocab and token embeddings are unnecessary but take up space. Therefore, I have organized only the necessary tokens in each language so that this model can be used in the monolingual setting.

linguistics,Best linguistics books for language learning?,"Hello everyone! I'm a language learner with a passion for linguistics. I don't consider myself a beginner when it comes to linguistics, but everything I've learned about the field has been through personal study(and Wikipedia articles). One of the biggest reasons for my being interested in linguistics is it's practical application to language learning. For example, a thorough understanding of grammar makes it easy to see how a language works before you even begin learning. And knowing how to read the IPA makes it easy to pick up new sounds in a language. 

Anyway, what I'm interested in are books that focus on how to use linguistics to learn language. Do you have any recommendations? Thanks!",1617276563,EndlessExploration,5

linguistics,"Is pronunciation difficulty a relative or an absolute concept, and if it is the latter do languages generally go from difficult to easy as times go by?","I noticed some languages have very difficult words to pronounce, such as consonant clusters of the most improbable type, and others within the same language family have a much simplified pronunciation of the same words. You may ask, difficult for whom? Difficulty depends on the native tongue. But, there are some objectively observable difficulties and complexities in phonology, I would assume. Certain consonant clusters, a very high number of vowels etc. Czech for example has some incredibly, crazy difficult clusters and other complexities (e.g. vowel length distinction), while Bulgarian doesn't, for exactly the same words of proto Slavic origin where the vocabulary is shared (has the same root). Am I right to think that proto Slavic must have been very complex in pronunciation and in most languages the sound combinations have simplified greatly with time, but some more conservative ones have preserved much of the original phonetical characteristics? I thought this might be similar with other families or languages through time?

After all, look at the incredibly complex pronunciation of ancient Greek vs the super easy/simplified pronunciation of modern Greek. 

My initial thought was (I'm not a linguist): as the language spreads to other people and territories and is being adopted by more as native, or simply as Lingua franca, pronunciation is simplified to accommodate most speakers of initially diverse languages (similar to grammar?). For example, look at how simple the pronunciation of most artificial languages is, like Esperanto. The idea is that anyone can pronounce it. You would think with natural languages the tendency would be to evolve in similar direction. 

But that doesn't seem to be the case when you look at some real examples. I wouldn't think Arabic has simplified despite its spread across vast territories, nor has Russian throughout the centuries. Or have they?

Do languages generally simplify their pronunciation as time goes by and they are adapted by more people (at which point they may also break in different languages for various reasons), or is such tendency not at all typical? And if it is typical, what might be the reasons that some languages like the difficult Czech (vs easy Bulgarian) or the relatively more difficult Italian (vs easy Spanish) preserve their complexities (which may come from the proto language or are native to the language in question) while others lend themselves to significant simplifications over time much more readily?",1617266993,uw888,92

linguistics,Speech Act Theory - Why so late to the game?,"Hello, I've recently been introduced to the theory of 'Speech Acts'.

From  [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/index.html):

&gt; We are attuned in everyday conversation not primarily to the sentences we utter to one another, but to the speech acts that those utterances are used to perform: requests, warnings, invitations, promises, apologies, predictions, and the like. Such acts are staples of communicative life, but only became a topic of sustained investigation, at least in the English-speaking world, in the middle of the twentieth  century.\[[1](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/speech-acts/notes.html#note-1)\]  Since that time “speech act theory” has become influential not only within philosophy, but also in linguistics, psychology, legal theory, artificial intelligence, literary theory, and feminist thought among other scholarly   disciplines.\[[2](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/speech-acts/notes.html#note-2)\]  Recognition of the significance of speech acts has illuminated the ability of language to do other things than describe reality. 

I have no formal education in the humanities, but in the last couple of years I have been introduced to  linguistics on a fairly cursory level. One thought that pops into my head fairly often when covering various aspects of linguistics is how contemporary it is. For example Noam Chomsky is the father of some very important theories in language acquisition, but he is alive today (albeit a bit on the wiser side!). 

Speech Act Theory arrived in the middle of the twentieth  century.  It brought the analysis of communication (and communicative intent of speakers) to a different level than simply looking at the language used. How was it that over the centuries seemly no one considered communication to be more than the sum of its parts? 

As mentioned I don't know much about the humanities, but issues like ethics and morality are as old as civilization itself. How is it that linguistic theories cannot be attributed to the ancients thinkers, or enlightenment thinkers. My assumption is that these issues have been, but in different contexts (and the fact that different languages and language variation over time etc. are also contributing factors). 

Is Speech Act Theory just a different way of explaining something already established?",1617196516,__Laine__,2

linguistics,English dialects,"Hi all, this is my first post here.

As far as I know, variation within English in the British Isles is nowadays mostly a matter of accent, with some local (mostly slangish) vocabulary, maybe one grammar point of two, and not much else.

However Scots, although vanishing and increasingly influenced by English, is a distinct Anglic language (with its syntax, its morphology, its vocabulary), which as far as I know is placed at the northernmost area of a (former?) dialect continuum with London (South-East?) English at the southern tip.

From what I've read, vernacular Northumbrian English is arguably closer to Scots than it is to Standard English, and Cumbrian is also very distinct too. A cursory look at the Wikipedia articles of these varieties points at rather significant differences with Standard English.

Once I found a text which was translated in a dozen English vernacular dialects (I don't know what century it was), and if I recall correctly while they could still be considered the same language, differences were stark (certainly not just accent).

I wonder if anyone has any description or outline of those vernaculars, or knows how and when London English displaced them.

I found there was a Survey of English Dialects in the 50s which went to towns and villages asking old people questions about their variety and that it was considered an urgent task because dialects were disappearing. I wonder if that means those local varieties were clearly separable from Standard English, in a fashion similar to that of German, Dutch, French (Oïl) dialects. Unfortunately I haven't found the results of that survey online.

So, does anyone have any insight on this topic? Thank you!",1617176635,zest16,3

linguistics,"I'm confused about ""proto languages""","I'm going to use the Indo European family as an example, but this applies to pretty much all primary language families.

Virtually all linguists agree that the current Indo European languages descended from an ancestral Proto Indo European (PIE) language believed to have been spoken in the Eurasian steppe. And that PIE branched into Tocharian, Hellenic, and many other branches when its speakers migrated further and further from the steppe, and started speaking new dialects that eventually became their own languages. This isn't where I have a problem. My problem is that the consensus is that all these branches formed at the exact same time, and that PIE went extinct instantly.

I have a problem with this because I think it's possible that the migrations happened at different times, and that PIE continued to be spoken by the proto Indo Europeans who were still living in the steppe.

A modern example of this is Dutch, which has a daughter language, Afrikaans (I'll try to keep this as non controversial as possible). Afrikaans was formed when Dutch people migrated to southern Africa in the 18th century and gradually started speaking a modified variant of Dutch that evolved into its own language. Both Afrikaans and Dutch (modern Dutch, the parent of Afrikaans) are spoken to this day.

So why is it that the original form of Proto-Indo-European couldn't have existed at the same time as Proto-Tocharian, or any other branch? When Afrikaans exists at the same time as its parent language, Dutch? I'm not denying that PIE is extinct, I'm questioning whether or not it's possible that it existed alongside one or more of its daughter branches.

And even if the migrations did happen at the same time, how likely is it that the proto-Tocharians and the proto-Hellenics stopped speaking PIE at the same time when they were located thousands of miles away from each other?

All of these look interesting, as was the case with the book I mentioned, but I suppose it is finding the area is most useful and doesn't require prior knowledge (or too much of it) from another area of linguistics. Here are my thoughts on what I think would be useful at this stage, highlighting a thought with each area;

&amp;#x200B;

Phonetics; Useful, but perhaps I just need to listen more. 

Phonology; Perhaps useful for for breaking down sounds from spoken speech.

Morphology; Useful, but perhaps I just need to read more. 

Syntax; (Same as above) but I like the grammatical analysis (might make reading less intuitive.)

Semantics; Useful; perhaps not as much as pragmatics, (might get too focused on single words)

Pragmatics; This seems the most useful, as it seems to incorporate different elements that are used in the listening, reading, writing and speaking, whilst being focus on area about meaning. 

Discourse Analysis; Looks too specific (maybe for later when I start writing more?)

Stylistics; Not really relevant (useful later?) 

Semiotics; Perhaps useful as reference alongside another area? (alongside things about idioms, expressions etc.) 

&amp;#x200B;

It's difficult to know for sure what would be useful, as I guess they all are in some way. And in addition to that, the idea arises in mind of how I might be deterred from using something because it requires prior knowledge from another area. 

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize Pragmatics looks pretty interesting, but It's hard to know for sure. (really want to just commit to one thing at a time.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Any recommendations of materials, plus ideas are welcome. 

&amp;#x200B;

“Although many scholars, especially those linked with generative grammar, proposed during the latter half of the 20th century that language is innate, no evidence was found to support their claim. The idea is today rejected by the mainstream psycholinguistic and child language acquisition researchers. Linguistic nativism now represents a marginal view in those fields.”

This was somewhat counter-intuitive/paradoxical to me, since I assumed the word 'mutual' meant that both speakers would experience equal 'levels' of similarity when speaking their respective languages to each other.

But after some thought, I realized that I guess every pair of 'mutually intelligible' languages is asymmetric *to some extent*, even if the asymmetry is extremely minute, and that this asymmetry can fluctuate between the languages depending on the context of discussion.

linguistics,"On the possessive ""it's""","People whine and whine about how some people write the possessive form of ""it"" with an apostrophe as ""it's"", instead of ""its"". Why? It makes more sense to write it with the apostrophe. We don't write ""the cats bowl"", we write ""the cat's bowl"". So why can't ""its bowl"" be written as ""it's bowl""?

And before you say ""*it's* is a contraction of *it is*"", just that a spelling is used for one thing doesn't mean it can't be used for another. In the phrases ""the cat's sleeping"", ""the cat's been sleeping"", and ""the cat's bowl"", ""cat's"" means the contraction for ""cat is"" in the first, ""cat has"" in the second, and ""of the cat"" in the third. The same punctuation is used for three different things. Nobody complains, because the context makes it unambiguous what it means.

In fact, historically, ""it's"" was what everybody used, and thus is was considered correct. Then ""its"" became more common, and people for some reason decided that ""it's"" should be incorrect. Yet people constantly use it that way. Apparently it's okay that people changed the punctuation back then, but they're not allowed to change it now?

linguistics,Consecutive list of grammar rules,"For a very long time I have been thinking about making a language learning tool or curriculum where you learn grammar by starting at the most general rule of the composition of words to firm sentences and consecutively learn more and more additional rules. I don't know enough about syntax yet, and I'm planning on studying it more in the future. However, it would be really useful if someone could give me a basic understanding of the nature of syntax, relevant to my idea.

For example, I believe I did see that Chomsky's first theory of syntax had some very basic rules - a sentence is an NP and a VP. A VP is a V and an NP. And so on.

So, imagine giving a student a first rule: sentence = NP + VP. You then give them some very simple NPs and VPs. NP: The dog. VP: jumps. And some others. They then practice filling in the sentence ""template"" with various choices, almost like a coloring book or a little puzzle. After a while, you add in a new ""structure"" rule: a VP can be also have an object, VP = V + NP. And so on. Ideally, you would eventually teach them all the rules of the language.

What I don't understand so far is, is there any such list? I have seen comprehensive grammars of English, but I'm not sure if they proceed in this consecutive way. They might focus on a particular word and some of its functions, like ""the"", or an ending or grammatical concept, like the past tense.

Has anyone just written up all the rules of English somewhere? I mean, imagine if you wanted to write a computer program that could generate grammatical English based on explicit rules. Has anyone done this?

linguistics,"Is affirming the existence of a ""neutral accent"" already part of ""badlinguistics""?","On various Spanish-speaking sites, Spanish-language help forums such as Quora, Reddit, Facebook, Wordreference, Duolingo forums, etc., even native-speaking help applications, several users claim with such certainty the existence of a neutral-speaking country.

Reading this statement is very improper or somewhat out of place for me as a native speaker.  
Here is the definition of ""neutro"" from the Diccionario de Lengua Española (DLE)

&gt;**neutro, tra**  
Del lat. *neŭter, neŭtra* 'ni uno, ni otro'.  
**1.** adj. Carente de rasgos distintivos o expresivos. *Un* *timbre* *de* *voz* *neutro.* *Mirada* *neutra.*  
*Real Academia Española © Todos los derechos reservados*

The first meaning generally refers to something or someone that lacks distinctive or expressive features.

Sadly some Spanish speakers or learners don't use the definition of *neutro* properly. A country that speaks *neutro* must lack distinctive features. It's impossible for a country's variant to be indistinguishable from the rest. It already has features to distinguish it from the others.

Is there an accent that doesn't give away the geographical location of the speaker? I think it's impossible to hide the accent. It's not enough to stop using slang or informal words, a standard country vocabulary won't be very easy to eliminate.

There are many names for ""car"" in Spanish, the main ones being *auto, coche, carro.* Which of the three words will be the most neutral and not give away the country? Me being Argentinian, we all say ""auto"". If a person living in my country says *coche* or *carro*, I unconsciously think (I could be wrong) that they may be a foreigner or a descendant of a foreigner. We have many words for a simple object, and I'd simply not consider that as slang.

Not to mention pronunciation, which varies from country to country. As a simple example, I don't think there is the correct pronunciation of the letter *S, Z* and *C* (before e, i) as the phoneme /s/ \[h\]\~\[s̺\]\~\[s̻\]\~\[x\]\~\[s̻̪\] or the pronunciation of the letter *Y* and the digraph *Ll*, nor do I claim that the elisions or weakening of certain letters is considered ""incorrect"" or ""foul-mouthed"". 

I add that many people use dubbing as an example to affirm the existence of the neutral accent.

In Mexico, many films that are not in Spanish are commonly dubbed there. They won't use slang but their vocabulary already gives away that the film was dubbed in Mexico.  
\- Calling *soda* for a fizzy drink, when many countries use *gaseosa*.  
\- Calling *chile* for chilli, when many countries use *ají*.

Do you really think it is appropriate to use the term ""neutral accent""? I'm really looking forward to hearing from your perspective, thank you very much.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

 * Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

 * Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

 * Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

 * Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

 * English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

 * Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

 * Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

 * Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

 * Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1617019220,AutoModerator,201

linguistics,where seldom is heard a discouraging word. backwards syntax?,"where seldom is heard a discouraging word. backwards syntax?

not sure if this is where to post this question... but .....

in the chorus of the song home on the range is the line ""where seldom is heard a discouraging word""

i'm not a linguist, so i don't know the technical way to describe my question, but it appears this uses some sort of backwards syntax of the phrase in question.

every time i hear this song i have to think about this phrase a few times to understand it's meaning.

to me, it would make more sense if the line was re-phrased ""A discouraging word is seldom(ly) heard""

Not sure how to break this down, but the former seems to use the noun (""word"") in the 2nd part of the phrase, whereas the latter example, the noun (""word"") is starting off the phrase.

Does anyone know what this type of ""backwards"" syntax is called? Can anyone think of any other examples in common songs or poems, etc..?

The only other example I can think of is slightly different and is from the poem twas the night before christmas in the opening line. ""‘Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house, Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse""

Here, one might argue the ""clearer"" phrase structure might be presented as ""Not even a mouse was stirring all through the house""

Obviously the poem is using creativity in it's form an thus the example I have given isn't sticking to the poems format and the example I have given would make much sense in the poem's context.

Anyways.. Pardon my linguistic ignorance, but this has always bugged me and would love to know the exact linguistic terminology of the home on the range example. (if any)

linguistics,Creating a writing system.,"Dear Linguists,

I've had an idea to create my very own writing system for Turkish which is my native tongue. First of all, it wouldn't be similar to modern Latin, Arabic scripts. I was trying to rethink about the most suitable alphabet for Turkish. I have been thinking what would suit well. Then, I thought why not check other agglutinative languages. There are Japanese and Korean. I, for once, thought, how about adopting Japanese for Turkish. Just I want to see how it would change my reading, writing and speaking. In short, I want to see its affect on my brain. But, I am just too lazy to memorize all these characters. When I checked Korean, I noticed that it's syllabic. Each square some characters/letters, and together they become one syllable. That got my attention. Then, I thought why not using just some basic strokes to write. I would divide this square into 4 pieces. It would be important where the strikes starts and which way it follows.

Today English speakers call it trunk but people who speak Urdu still call it Diggy (albeit with a VERY heavy accent). Another one is Qabaard, which is basically the English word Cupboard that got so heavily accented it made its own word.

linguistics,"Are there cases of bidirectional assimilation that show a ""closest-first"" preference?","Hi everyone! I am looking for a specific and rather obscure type of phonological process (that may not even exist): bidirectional assimilation with an additional “closest-first” criterion. That is, a segment can assimilate to a relevant donor that precedes OR follows it, but clearly exhibits a preference for the closest (in segmental distance) donor.

Let me illustrate using a hypothetical example. Consider a hypothetical bidirectional process of epenthetic vowel harmony (VH), where V1 has \[+F\], V2 has \[-F\], and E represents an epenthetic vowel; C are consonants (irrelevant for VH):

1. V1 C C E C V2
2. V1 C E C C V2
3. V2 C C E C V1
4. V2 C E C C V1

What should we expect from epenthetic VH? Three logical possibilities appear to me:

1. **Directional preference**: E prefers to harmonise with a vowel in a specific direction. For example, if it prefers the vowel to its right, then it will pick V2 in (1,2) and V1 in (3,4).
2. **Featural preference**: E prefers to harmonise with just one of the \[F\] values, say \[+F\], so it will always pick V1 in (1-4)
3. **Distance preference**:  E prefers to harmonise with the closest V (measured in terms of segmental distance, in these examples number of intervening Cs).

Cases of directional preference can be found, e.g. Sesotho epenthesis in loanword adaptation (Rose &amp; Demuth 2006). Featural preference is present in so-called dominant-recessive harmony systems, so the theoretical machinery is already required under any account. But are there cases of patterns showing distance preference? (Note that it doesn't have to be a harmony process specifically - any kind of process that shows this bidirectionality + ""closest-first"" preference would do.)

However, my language is often very colloquial and that is not what the teachers and professors want to hear in that exam. English is not my first language thus I wanted to ask some native speakers for tips :) (I am not looking for basic English rules tho, been speaking English for 15 years I think I got the most important things, just looking for some nice phrases to improve my speaking)

Therefore, I am asking you about some eloquent and formal phrases that I can build in to make my language sound more professional and qualitative.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

 * Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

 * Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

 * Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

 * Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

 * English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

 * Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

 * Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

 * Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

 * Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1615809623,AutoModerator,77
linguistics,Is there a potential for machine learning software to find previously-unproven connections between languages?,"Maybe this question is better-suited for a subreddit more focused on the technology of such a software than this one, but I am more interested in linguistics, so I thought to post it here.

Basically, I am wondering if such a technology would be plausible in the near-ish future. I think it is a given at this point that highly trained neural networks can “see” a lot of patterns and other things that humans cannot. They are so far advanced already in chess, for example, that certain *moves* in chess games are sometimes referred to as “computer moves”. These moves seem completely irrational for any skilled human to play, only because they are necessary to execute an attack 30 moves later or something like that, which a human would never be able to work out under normal time controls.

There are also machine-learning applications such as the (in?)famous YouTube algorithm which, in my opinion at least, is able to make video recommendations based on past videos watched that even a large group of humans would not be able to do as well.

Now, most of you reading this probably know that there are unproven and dubious language families such as Altaic, Dené-Caucasian, and even Nostratic, where humans have tried to establish links between languages that sometimes seem completely unrelated. These hypotheses are, of course, often thrown out due to lack of sufficient evidence. Is there a good chance that a very well-trained machine learning software could decisively establish links between certain languages where it would be implausible for humans to do so in the same way? Furthermore, if they could make these solid connections, is it possible that some of them would be “unverifiable” by humans due to their complexity and the opacity of whatever algorithm finds them, leading to us just having to “take the computers’ word for it”? Naturally, I doubt there is a simple yes or no answer to these question, so I would just like to get people’s thoughts on the matter. Additionally, if such attempts at linguistic genealogy have already been attempted, I would be very interested in learning about them.",1615804883,BossaNova1423,66

e.g. ""it is going to rain""

or ""it is better to eat now than later""

or ""it is a miracle he survived""

I first thought that, especially in the last case, that maybe ""it"" referred to the end part"" (""he survived""), but then I found that trying to rephrase the sentence to eliminate this pronoun was surprisingly difficult. 

""The fact that he survived is a miracle""

""A miracle is that he survived"" (this sounds really awkward)

I don't even know how I would rephrase the first example without it sounded really strange.

linguistics,List of shared origin Korean / Japanese / Chinese words?,"I have been slowly learning Japanese, Korean and Mandarin, and have become interested in learning new vocabulary through exposure to words shared across the 3 languages whenever possible, and am wondering if anyone knows of good resources which capture this -

I believe these words are generally referred to as [Sino-Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Korean_vocabulary) and [Sino-Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Japanese_vocabulary) vocabulary -

From my preliminary searching, it's clear that some words, while sharing characters, have slightly different to substantially different meanings. It also seems common that a word is frequently used in one or two of the three languages, while a different word (usually containing 1 of the 2 characters, or maintaining a similar pronunciation) is used more frequently in the other, like ""misunderstanding"" above, which in Mandarin shows up as both  ""误会"" (HSK 4 frequency) and ""误解"" (HSK 6 frequency).

**TL;DR:**

Even still, many words:  
1. Have the same or very similar meanings

2. Are commonly used

3. Are composed of the same characters

4. Haver similar or consistently changed pronunciation  

A list of these similar words feels like something that must already exist somewhere, but I haven't been able to find it.

Websites, books, Anki flashcard sets, anything - anyone know of anywhere with this data?

Disclaimer: - I know that this information alone is not necessarily an efficient or effective way to learn any one of these 3 languages. From what I've done so far in this direction, it's helped improve my reading ability (especially Japanese &lt;-&gt; Chinese) and helped to bolster my Korean vocab understanding. Separately as someone interested in these languages, it's pretty fun to see.

I am also aware of the CJKV dictionary, a tool that searches across Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese dictionaries ([Example search for 誤解](https://cjkv-dict.com/?search=%E8%AA%A4%E8%A7%A3)). This is quite helpful, but if possible I am wondering if a list of related words that has already been compiled and curated already exists.",1615769514,cccabo-c,7
linguistics,What is the relationship between the preference of long sentences with multiple relative clauses in European language and people's working memory? Which is the prerequisite?,"Sentences in English (as well as in German, French etc.) academic articles are often extremely long, can take more than 5 lines. Also in daily speech, people often add one or more extra subordinate clauses with words such as ""which"", ""by which"", ""that"" etc. at the end of the sentence. On the other hand, Chinese sentences are short, both in academic and oral use. A sentence from an article in a European language can often be broken down into a few sentences when translated into Chinese.

(Though there is not a clear way to definite ""length of a sentence"", but you can see the difference.)

In order to produce and comprehend such long sentences, a big working memory is required. But how is the relationship between sentence length in a language and the working memory of the people speaking the language? Is the pre-existing big working memory the prerequisite which allows the use of long sentences? or is it the other way round, the use of long sentences promoted the big working memory since childhood?",1615759351,Gareitz,6
linguistics,Why are older languages or older forms of languages regarded by a lot of people to be purer?,"I understand that with a lot of ancient languages, they were used for religious purposes or were spoken by the high class elites, so as a result they were held up to a high esteem, as in the case with Ancient Latin or Sanskrit, but even without that, it seems like modern-day people a lot of times regard the older forms of their languages as being purer. Why is this? Classical Arabic is one example, where it's looked at by a lot of people as being the purest and most sophisticated form of Arabic. The same thing can also be said about Classical Armenian. Is it because the older forms of these languages maybe used less loan words? Is it because they were used by scholarly elites? I don't see what's inherently less ""pure"" about the modern form of a language compared to its ancient counterpart, so why do a lot of people seem to hold this view?

linguistics,Can determiner+adjective+noun constructions in French be analyzed as single words?,"Usually when I see discussions about word boundaries and clitics-vs-affixes in French, it's about verbs and whether or not subject ""pronouns"" are agreement markers. I haven't seen much discussion about word boundaries in noun phrases, though. It seems like most people assume that adjectives are independent words and article are clitics that attach to the noun phrase.

Why don't people analyze determiner+adjective+noun constructions as single words instead, with determiners as prefixes, prenominal adjectives incorporated into the noun (while postnominal adjectives are still syntactically independent), and liaison as internal instead of external sandhi?

Going by [this](https://imgur.com/LglKHK1) list of word boundary tests that was linked to in one of the comments [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/19z0pc/if_french_was_discovered_today_with_no_written/), French determiner+adjective+noun phrases clearly satisfy a-e (and interestingly for e, explicit conjunction is obligatory for postnominal adjectives and illegal for prenominal adjectives, e.g. ""la nouvelle petite voiture"" vs ""la voiture bleue et rapide""). I think f and g are true as well but I don't want to say that for sure without data to back it up.

Also, as a related question, if determiners are prefixes and not clitics, could contracted articles be seen as case markers? So French nouns would have the following obligatory prefixes (except in certain phrases with de, where de can be analyzed as a compounding particle instead of a preposition) that specify case, number, gender, and definiteness:

So initial ""b"" letter is not allows to sound like \[p\]. Same with ending ""b"". It is always \[b\], not \[p\]. Also, Royal English isolated \[p\], \[t\], \[k\] have almost no aspiration, but still distinguished from \[b\], \[t\], \[g\]. So when Royal speaker says ""Paul', he actually says ""P-h(very subtle)-all"". But when Canadian or American says same name, it wil be ""P-HHH-all"". Yes, too strong.

I see the reason in inability to hear differenc between voiced and unvoiced consonants. Because of this Americans tends to pronounce ""better"" as ""bedder"" etc.

So, my question is... Is such aspiration due to some kind of deafness, so you have to lengthen H sound? Every time after hearing this I go and check old and newest videos with Queen Elizabeth and other Royal speakers. They do not speak this way.",1615729695,Vizionmaker,10

linguistics,"Is there something like a base pitch in a language? And where can I read about it more, if yes.","I noticed that different languages have a ""base pitch"" and that if a person switches a language the pitch usually changes as well (at least if they are native/fluent).

For example, I know people who speak German and Turksh and when they switch from German to Turkish their pitch becomes deeper (though I usually usually notice is stronger with men) and it does not really seem like they are doing it on purpose to sound deeper.

Similar observances I have with Russian, Chechen and Kabardian (Circassian). When speaking Russian, they speak more or less like a normal Russian, but if they switch to Chechen, their voice becomes automatically deeper, while in case of Kabardian it seems the other way around (not strong as with some Asian languages like Thai, but compared to Chechen it seems to go higher), at least if compared to Russian.

And then we also have various South East Asian language, like Thai (but not only), where at least in my personal opinion, the people have a much higher ""base pitch"", and this is especially noticeable if they switch language from German or English

It's actually quite weird that I never encountered it when reading through linguist literature, because I frequently read about things like speed of a language, while the ""base pitch"" I can't remember to have come across.

So is it maybe ultimately linked to ""base speed"" of a language? Maybe just the collection of phonemes make it sound a certain way? Is it maybe just cultural, like how in Japan women usually take with a higher pitch than men, which in the end more or less becomes a feature of the language?",1615722724,CDWEBI,2

linguistics,Progress within linguistics,"Hi all!

I've been wondering lately: what are some (relatively uncontroversial) examples of ""progress"" within linguistics? I'm interested in examples of progress within any of its subfields.

For example, I know that in historical linguistics, people used to believe that all languages are descended from Hebrew, and various fanciful ""etymologies"" were provided to prove this. Such etymologies were unsystematic; basically, people collected lists of words that sound kind of similar and have somewhat similar meanings and used this to ""prove"" any relationship they wanted to prove.

This changed when the Neogrammarians introduced the concept of a ""regular sound change"", and along with the ""comparative method"", scholars were highly constrained in what could be considered a proper etymology. Eventually, this led to the discovery of various currently accepted language families, like Indo-European, Uralic, and Semitic, which are generally still seen as valid today. So I would say the development of the concepts of ""regular sound change"" and the ""comparative method"" are pretty clear examples of progress within historical linguistics.

In phonetics and phonology, one early example of progress was when linguists began to clearly distinguish between letters and sounds. Relatedly, another example of progress was the distinction between ""phone"" and ""phoneme"". The discovery of various classes of sounds previously unknown to linguists is another example of progress (for example, ""discovering"" clicks, ejectives, implosives, pharyngeals, and basically any other sounds which aren't found in the European languages spoken by most linguists.) 

So I'm curious, what are some other relatively uncontroversial examples of progress within any of the subfields linguistics?",1615676339,Jonathan3628,7

2. Faster to read perhaps, since the words are all distinct ? When I used to study Arabic, I always got slowed down when reading, because the words all look the same. With Chinese, provided I recognize all the characters, I can quickly go over the whole sentence.

linguistics,Stability of extremely large phonemic inventories,"Phonology has always been my favourite aspect of studying new languages and a question which has frequently occurred to me is *how can incredibly complex phonemic inventories remain stable?*

A perfect example is that of Archi, which contains among others the extremely rare contrasting set of four velar laterals, namely \[ʟ̝̊ ʟ̝̊ʷ ʟ̝̊ː ʟ̝̊ːʷ\], as well as such oddities as \[k͡ʟ̝̊ʷʼ\]. Furthermore, according to the [Archi Language Dictionary](https://www.smg.surrey.ac.uk/archi-dictionary), the comparatively basic \[t͡sː\] occurs in just one lexeme, and others (namely \[ʁˤʷ\] and \[ʟ̝\]) have just three and two dictionary-listed words respectively. Furthermore there are several apparent phonemes (being \[dʷ kːʷ t͡sʷ t͡ʃːʼ sʷ sːʷ ʁʷ\]) which are listed in the [Archi Language Tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20110904070032/http://www.archi.surrey.ac.uk/handout.pdf) but which have no entries at all in the Dictionary.

So my questions are these:-

* How do such incredibly complex phonemic inventories remain stable, especially given the minute differences between certain individual phonemes?
* How can a given phoneme, such as \[ʟ̝\] in Archi, appear in just a few words, yet not be merged with a far more common phoneme?

""*I have got an obligation to prepare dinner*"" becomes 

""*I gotta cook dinner*."" 

We see the same laziness with languages dropping pronouns, lenition, and so on. 

Do we see the same, ever, with spelling? Mainly through texting, I've found that ""we'll"" vs ""well"" is an annoying distinction and, from an ambiguity perspective, an unnecessary distinction. So... when one types ""well"" but means the other word, it's still clear what they intended. 

Similarly, it's a bit tough to find a situation where the wrong ""there/they're/their"" leads to ambiguity. *Their going to the store. They're is the door.

linguistics,Need help with my students' grammar acquisition.,"Hey there.

I'm teaching English as a foreign language.  I have a degree in linguistics and I'm also a fluent L2 in the native language here.  I know what my language learning journey has been like but it's my goal to use this knowledge to help my students.

The problem I have is very specific: I'm having a lot of trouble with some of my upper level students (B2 course) who CANNOT seem to get their grammar right.  Some mistakes are normal, but they have systematic errors that make it very clear that they simply have not acquired the grammar properly.

It's usually older students (25+). Young students do not have this problem, and for me it's very obvious why: they are exposed to English in media, social media, series, internet, etc.  Krashen input hypothesis, etc. 

My theory is that the older students have learned in a very flawed way: memorization and repitition. You can fake it to some degree, but eventually with time you will see who has either acquired the language and who hasn't. Conscience learning won't cut it.  

Two problems:

I insist to my students that they watch series in English, watch news, read, listen to music, anything they possibly can.  But for some reason they seem stuck on the old way of doing things.  I don't really know how to get through to them that they just need a lot more exposure. 

Secondly, I'm an assistant teacher, and I don't get much support from the rest of the teachers who are somewhat old guard.  They want me to go in and point out mistakes and prepare activities to correct them.  Not A2 level.  B2 level.

I don't think it's necessarily a horrible idea.  I know that with my own learning it's been nice to have a map in my head of how the language works.  So I'm willing to give it a try.

At the same time, I'm second-guessing myself and wondering if I'm not the fool here.  With my job I kind of have to adapt to what the head teachers tell me, but with the students I tutor I'd like to get some opinions on what's the most effective strategy for this kind of thing.

I have one student who is B2 level who is a student at my school as well as a student I tutor privately. She just did an awful oral exam (loads of grammar mistakes) and I'd like to figure out how to best address this issue going forward.

If this is not the appropriate sub for this, I apologise, and please recommend me a better one if you can.

Blazek’s main hypothesis is that the speakers of languages ancestral to “Common Australian” (the oldest reconstructible proto-language of Australia) left behind their linguistic footprints in the vocabularies of some language families and language isolates of South Asia before migrating to Southeast Asia, and from there to Australia, about 50,000 years BP. Such a linguistic hypothesis doesn’t entail a common genetic ancestry of Australian and Dravidian languages, but rather the possibility that a layer of words dating from the time of the migration of modern humans to Australia along the “Southern Route” may have survived in the Dravidian vocabulary. Blazek’s hypothesis does, of course, not amount to saying that Dravidian languages were spoken in South Asia 50,000 years ago. Proto-Dravidian speakers probably migrated into South Asia from the west (Iran / Central Asia) at a much later date. The immigrating Dravidians would have assimilated, both culturally and genetically, the (AASI?) indigenous speakers of some by now extinct South Asian language families that still preserved some lexical relics of languages spoken at ca. 50,000 years BP by modern human populations ancestral to Australian aborigines. The lexical sets studied by Blazek could have entered the Proto-Dravidian vocabulary after the speakers of the latter language migrated into South Asia. If Blazek is right, the alleged substrate words he lists in his paper (more than 70 sets) would represent one of the oldest – if not *the* oldest – linguistic substratum ever recorded across the world!""

linguistics,Article use in spoken English,"Hey everyone,

I have a question on the article use in the English language. I‘ve read a lot of grammar books, but couldn’t really seem to find an answer. Do I use an article (definite or indefinite) when I‘m, let‘s say, talking about different colour options, and I‘m showing  my conversation partner the colours as I‘m speaking  of them - „Peach colour“ - „Dark blue colour“ 

I‘m writing a paper on the article use of an Korean ASMR YouTuber and I feel like I would use an article, but I can’t really tell if it’s really wrong of her not to use one in this context. (I am not an English native speaker myself)

It’s hard for me to find an answer to this in grammar books as she‘s not talking in full sentences, and I really don’t want to write „I‘m not sure“ in my paper, haha. 

Thank you!",1615455469,shenaiii,3

linguistics,“To go” as a future tense across languages,"Using “go” as a way to make a verb future tense is common on English, obviously: “I am going to send you a picture” does not imply movement from one place to another. It just means that the sending is going to be in the future. 

So that’s English. I believe that this construct works in German and French too. Now I also know a little Hebrew, and it seems it also works in modern usage there: we can word for word replace the English with Hebrew: אני הולך לשלוח לך תמונה. (I, go, to-send, to-you, picture). However I do not ever recall seeing the construct in older (biblical) Hebrew. I have a suspicion that the construct entered modern Hebrew via European speakers. I asked a Thai friend who confirmed that you can’t use “go” like this in Thai, so it’s not universal. 

So here are my questions:

Firstly, is there a term for this phenomenon, in which a grammatical pattern gets copied into a language, but using the destination language words? I vaguely recall that the English present continuous tense came into English from Welsh in a similar way. 

Secondly, am I right about the specific example of “go” as a future marker being European and migrating into modern Hebrew?",1615448573,happy2harris,21

linguistics,AI and language translations,"As we all know computers still can’t translate full sentences and need humans to finalize the result to ensure it transfers the meaning accurately. 

In order for humans to translate a text from one language to another, we first read the original version, digest and comprehend it fully then come up with a way to convey it in the target language. 

In most cases we need to read the whole paragraph or the chapter to understand the meaning of a given sentence. If you are translating large bodies of text such as books, you may even need to have a knowledge of the previous chapters to have the context and background. 

What would AI have to do in this case? It would probably first need to consume the whole body of text, whether it’s a simple article or a book. 

Then it will have to draw a picture or even create a movie based on the information it consumed. 

Then it would describe the picture or the movie in the target language. 

In my opinion, when humans build such a machine that’s able to fully comprehend and translate any given text, then that means that we are not too far from a generalized AI. 

If some of you don’t know, most AI’s we have today are narrow or specialized AIs that only know how to do one thing, for example show you an advertisement on Facebook.

linguistics,"Why do some words sound ""wrong""?","This might be a weird question. I am a linguistics student at university, so bear with me ;) 

Every language has a phonemic inventory of sounds that exist within that language as well as various possible syllables, such as VC or CV. However, it occurs to me that there is also something like what syllables tend to be put together. For instance, I know that ""wakihihi"" is a possible combination of syllables in Japanese, yet it doesn't sound like a Japanese word to me, but more like some Polynesian language.

I use Japanese as an example because I speak the language at a somewhat intermediate level, and I sometimes get the random thought of ""huh, I wonder if (random syllable combination) is a word in Japanese?"". However, I can often instinctively tell whether something is realistically a word or not. Other examples would be ""kahaha"", ""baha"", ""horomoho"", which are gibberish words that contain sounds within Japanese and follow the Japanese syllable rules, but still don't seem like they would be native Japanese words. 

I'm just looking to be pointed in the direction of what exactly this phenomenon I'm describing is. I assume it is the case that since languages have only certain possible syllable types, there are also some other tendencies or rules of how to put syllables together in words, or perhaps moreso which phonemes tend to occur after each other, which we, as speakers, might be implicitly aware of, but which I am not able to describe properly.

linguistics,Are literacy issues less common in languages with a predominantly native word inventory?,"In English, the ""big words"" are predominantly of French/Latin and Greek origin. It seems heavy use of words of French/Latin and Greek origin in English is considered either sophisticated or pompous, whereas heavy use of native English/Germanic words is considered either down to earth or unsophisticated.

Whereas in most other Germanic languages and the Slavic languages, for example, it seems that these ""big words"" are usually formed from native Germanic or Slavic roots, and they have far less foreign loan words.

Because even most of the words describing more complex ideas in these languages are formed from basic native word roots, does this mean that speakers of these languages are less likely to have literacy problems than speakers of English?

linguistics,Developmental linguistics - nonstandard english in children's books ok?,"I'm not sure if this is the right forum, but I'm also not sure what would be better, so here goes:

I'm in the early stages of developing a children's story based on my 3 year-old's imaginary friend. As such much of the writing is actually done by him in his current 3-year old voice, which uses a particular nonstandard phraseology. For instance ""Wiggy-a-Worm is live in the sand with he mama"".

Most kids books I see are written in *very* clear standard english, which I assume must be deliberate. At the same time I doubt that kids are going to be confused by nonstandard grammar; they are famously adept at navigating different types of language.

linguistics,Gap Between Written and Spoken Sounds,"Some languages are easy to sound out because the writing system is so phonetic. You learn what each atomic piece of written text sounds like, and viola, you can sound out a piece of text without glaring errors.

Some languages are easy to sound out because the language does not have (1) lexical prosodic features, (2) strong assimilation, or (3) many irregularities. You learn the consonants and vowels, and boom, you can sound things out correctly.

For example, **Chinese** is difficult to sound out from the characters even if you know all the radicals. However, pin yin is very predictable and explicit and easy to sound out correctly (for a native child, for example.)

**Japanese** written out in kana is mora-timed, does not have strong assimilation, and has very few I-Gotcha\`s. However, the pitch accent is not explicitly written, making it impossible to sound out correctly.

**English** has a distinctly un-phonetic writing system, has lexical stress, strong assimilation, and many irregularities. It's hard to sound out even for natives sometimes. Non-natives who have learned the alphabet do atrociously reading new material.

Standard **Korean** does not have any lexical accent and has a very phonetic writing system, albeit with strong assimilation and some irregularities. You can expect reasonable accuracy even without learning the pronunciation rules.

**French** is syllable-timed, with a predictable accent and a somewhat phonetic writing system (what you see is *not* what you get, but it's consistent in its irregularities), but with very strong assimilation and a large gap between the written and spoken language. It's certainly easier to sound out correctly than Chinese, Japanese, and English.

My question:

&gt;What languages are easy to sound out from the writing, from the perspective of someone who has learned what each piece of the written system means?

linguistics,Linguistics of partner dancing?,"tl;dr Partner dancing is all about communication between two dance partners—there are a LOT of features (examples forthcoming) of social dance that remind me of features of language. Anyone know of any resources/research on this?

Ok hear me out. First, a brief description of how social dance works for those who don't partake, and then some of the features that strike me as very language-like.

*Generally speaking* partner dancing involves a 'lead,' who determines the overall shape of the dance, and a 'follow,' who listens to the physical cues the lead is giving them. This is pretty much one-way for beginners, but more experienced dancers describe this as much more of a conversation, where the follow can 'suggest' particular moves as well.

Ok so here are the language-y things about it:

1. There are many different partner dances. They are usually associated with a geographic region and culture, and these styles evolve over time. They also evolve/combine/diverge into totally new dances (e.g. Lindy Hop growing into Balboa). There are dances that are related more like dialects (e.g. East Coast Swing and Lindy Hop), where folks who only know one or the other can dance with each other. There are others that are like totally separate languages, where folks would *not* be able to dance with each other without learning the other dance first (e.g. Lindy Hop and Bachata)
2. Local communities exist, where in a particular city folks will teach each other and mostly dance with each other. They also meet up for (inter)national events where that vocabulary is shared/standardized across regions. But local 'accents' exist, e.g. 'West Coast' style Lindy Hop (which is smoother) vs 'East Coast' style Lindy Hop (which is bouncier).
3. Vocabulary: there are certain ""moves"" associated with any given dance. Some very simple ones are shared between dances (but inflected with that dance's style). Some of the shared moves are like cognates (common ancestor dance), others like loan words (directly borrowed from another dance). Different local communities will have different lexicons, and these get exchanged at the larger events.
4. Grammar: It is not the case that any move can follow any other move; to continue in the Lindy Hop example, there are concepts of 'momentum' and 'tension' that dictate how/which moves can flow into each other.

linguistics,Sanskrit vs. Middle Indic: literary languages as precursors to vernacular languages?,"*(I had initially thought to post this to* r/sanskrit, *but figured it might be of broader linguistic interest, since it concerns methodology in etymology in general, esp. as relates to literary vs. oral language use. If I'm wrong and should just post there instead, let me know!)*

I often come across etymologies of words in modern South Asian (SA) languages that trace them back to earlier Sanskrit words. For instance,

* [this entry in etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=juggernaut) traces an English loanword ('juggernaut') from Hindi back to a Sanskrit word
* [this entry on etymonline](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=sugar) traces an English word ('sugar') back, through Arabic and Persian, ultimately to a Sanskrit word
* [this entry in wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A8#Hindi) describes a common Hindi word ('दिन') as ""inherited from Sanskrit""

But afaik, Sanskrit was primarily a literary and elite language, not a popular or vernacular language. Though there's [scholarly dispute about this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit#Sanskrit_and_Prakrit_languages), there seems to be some consensus that at least by the first millenium CE (about millenium before the emergence of the modern SA vernaculars like Hindustani, Kannada, Telugu, Bengali, etc.), Sanskrit --- if not also Prakrit --- was confined to royal and religious elite groups. I believe the linguistic predecessors to modern SA languages are known as ""Middle Indic"" languages, which [developed independently of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Indo-Aryan_languages) (though alongside) classical Sanskrit.

**But if that's so, how can we legitimately cite Sanskrit words as etymological precursors of modern SA words?** Aren't we assuming here that Sanskrit words somehow ""filtered into common usage""? Wouldn't it be better to cite vernacular South Asian languages, or just generically refer to ""Middle Indic"" precursors? Or is this just a matter of scholarly convenience, since we rely on Sanskrit texts for historical attestations of words?",1615169072,finstaboi,4

I would love if you could share what are in your opinions the best examples of online actions, portals, projects and communities dedicated to the revival and spread of local languages worldwide.

I am not too informed, but my guess would be Cornish and Welsh are two successful examples of how things can be done well, and declining (or lost in the case o Cornish) languages can get a great boost in saving themselves, thanks to the cultural economies of scale that the web and related medias offer.

&amp;#x200B;

I come from a region (North-Western Croatia) which has two local languages that are slowly losing speakers year in, year out (that is the local Venetian dialects and the local Chakavian language).

I work with a number of local associations that are trying to preserve and spread the knowledge of these languages. These are alas quite small associations, and not always successful in what they do. Due to political decisions and particular centralist visions, the Croatian government has always been extremely unsupportive with these local languages, which still have a large amount of speakers in certain areas, but may be due for disappearing in a couple of generations if things stay on the current level. That is to say that any effort and initiative aimed at improving the situation of local languages cannot count with the institutions to be a driver, but at best a follower.

As a person active in IT and marketing, I would like to help these associations and local academics and curious people of the language to step their game up in the media sector, and help them successfully move from the current status quo, to a situation where these languages become much more (at least culturally, if not linguistically) known and appreciated at the local level.

linguistics,Two questions about Portuguese verb vowel alternations,"Any chance any of y'all know a thing or two about Portuguese verbs? The structure, at least in the present tense, is:

    root - theme vowel (TV) - person/number suffix

(The TV can be *a* *e* or *i*, and it's lexically determined / different for every verb.)

There are a few papers exploring how, when the last vowel in the root is a mid vowel (&lt;e&gt; or &lt;o&gt;, and the theme vowel is followed by another vowel, the root vowel harmonizes in height with the theme vowel before the theme vowel is truncated. This explains how you start with a root like [dɔrm] 'sleep' and from *dɔrm-i-o* get &lt;durmo&gt; [durmu] 'I sleep':

    dɔrm-i-o          durm-i-o           durm-o        durm-u
    sleep-TV-1.sg     height harmony     truncation    word-final vowel raising, unrelated 

However, from the same root there is also the form &lt;dorme&gt; [dɔrmi] '(s)he sleeps' which I'm having trouble explaining. Assuming that the 3sg suffix is *-e*, from *dɔrm-i-e* I would also expect *[durmi] instead of the actual [dɔrmi]:

    dɔrm-i-e          durm-i-e           durm-e        durm-i                     
    sleep-TV-1.sg     height harmony     truncation    word-final vowel raising

Curiously, none of the papers I've found derive 3sg forms like this. So what prevents the root vowel from harmonizing here? I have two guesses, neither of which I'm thrilled with:

1 - Maybe the *-e* suffix truncates the theme vowel *before* harmony, in contrast to the *-o*, which truncates after? It's pretty weird for two similar suffixes to have rules apply at different points in the ordering, but it does produce [dɔrmi]:

    dɔrm-i-e          dɔrm-e                           dɔrm-i
    sleep-TV-1.sg     truncation     harmony           word-final vowel raising
                                     (environment not satisfied) 

2 - Maybe the 3sg suffix is actually null. It's null with the other two theme vowels *a* and *e*, e.g. *mɔr-a-∅* '(s)he resides* and *mɔv-e-∅* '(s)he moves', so there's that consistency. And an underlying *dɔrm-i-∅* correctly gives [dɔrmi]. Then the orthographic &lt;-e&gt; is hard to explain - historical quirk? spelling convention? - but word-final &lt;-e&gt; in Portuguese is basically always [i].

So there are my two layman's guesses. Any thoughts?

My second question involves verbs like &lt;fugir&gt; [fuʒ-i-ʁ] 'to flee'. Ignoring the imperative, the present-tense forms *could* conceivably point to a root *fɔʒ*. [fuʒ-u] 'I flee' could be derived from *fɔʒ-i-o* in the same way as [durm-u] above, and forms like [fɔʒ-e] '(s)he flees' show a surface [ɔ].

But then we have the infinitive form [fuʒ-i-ʁ] featuring infinitive suffix *ʁ*. Here, the theme vowel cannot trigger harmony as it's not followed by a vowel; *fɔʒ-i-ʁ* cannot produce [fuʒ-i-ʁ]. Good thing, too, as *dɔrm-i-ʁ* doesn't produce *[durm-i-ʁ].

It's tempting to say that the infinitive suffix is actually *-iʁ*. Then, underlying *fɔʒ-i-iʁ* can harmonize to [fuʒ-i-iʁ] and truncate to expected [fuʒ-i-ʁ]. But with the other theme vowels there's no reason to propose an infinitive suffix other than plain ol' *ʁ*, so we lose that consistency. Not a fan.

So the best I got is proposing an actual *fuʒ* with a rule that drops the [u] to an [ɔ]. However, I can't find references to anything like that in the literature. Are there more rules that affect verb-root-final high vowels in Portuguese?

Thanks in advance!",1614829598,theycallmezeal,34
linguistics,Statistical method for language proficiency evaluation,"Hello, linguists! I'm here to hear (I mean, read) your thoughts on an idea of mine.

Consider the problem of evaluating someone's level of proficiency in a given language that they're learning.

The simplest approach is to give the person a bunch of questions, see how many questions they got right, then use a table of reference to get the results. This table of reference may look like this:

Points | Fluency level
------|-------------
91-100 | Fluent
81-90 | Advanced
66-80 | High intermediate
51-65 | Low intermediate
41-55 | High beginner
0-40 | Low beginner

Problem is, such a simplistic approach doesn't take into consideration _what_ questions the person got right. What if they know a lot of vocabulary, but lack in the grammar department? Should that impact in their result? If yes, how so?

Now my idea comes in.

A [bayesian network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network) could be fed with their answers and return _the probability for each level of proficiency_. The result would not be a single, specific fluency level -- it would be a list of probabilities.

The output of this computer analysis would look like:

Probability | Fluency level
-----------|-------------
10% | Fluent
60% | Advanced
25% | High intermediate
5% | Low intermediate
0% | High beginner
0% | Low beginner

The test taker may be a fluent speaker in a bad day, or a high intermediate in a good day, but it's most likely an advanced speaker.

What do you think about this idea?

Be honest. And creative. I'm open to suggestions!",1614829318,schizo-learner,25

This seemed obvious enough, as I knew mammary glands referred to that anatomical structure, but it left me curious about the words relationship to parental titles.

I've heard somewhere that ""ma"" and ""pa"" are almost universal titles due to the fact that they're some of the first sounds we're capable of making as humans. This suggested to me that we built the words for ""mother"" and ""father"" out of those sounds, but it doesn't explain how ""mamma"" evolved.

I know that PIE itself is a reconstructed language dating back to 5-7 thousand years ago, so making any decisions based on a reconstruction is at the very least speculative, but that doesn't mean people don't have ideas, right? The reason I'm asking this is because from what I could gather, mere phonological processes are not enough to prompt a transition from an agglutinative language to a fusional one. At least some analogical change is in due, along with reanalysis. But seeing precise examples, or at least confirmation from other linguists (and not just my hunch) would be reassuring!

GitHub:  [https://github.com/LexingtonWhalen/KanjiStrokesAnalysis](https://github.com/LexingtonWhalen/KanjiStrokesAnalysis) 

(I think you guys should be able to view the jupyter notebook file. Let me know!)

**Purpose:**

I wanted to analyze the stroke counts (a measure of kanji complexity) versus the frequency of words using that kanji. I was unable to find any data on this, so I did it myself! I thought maybe this would shed some light on how languages can balance possibility for expression and memory limits of human beings (ie: 8 strokes can create more characters than 1, but they are harder to remember).

&amp;#x200B;

In the GitHub are the pngs of the graphs shown. They are pretty neat!

&amp;#x200B;

**Features:**

\* Analysis of Kanji stroke patterns by overall word frequency!

\* Weighs each Kanji by their average use in natural language, then finds the most common stroke counts used in every-day language!

\* Graphs! (Bar and Pie right now).

\* Finds standard deviation and mean of most common stroke counts!

I have a video game which I've developed. The game has a simulated world full of objects, creatures, and other computer-controlled 'humans' for you to interact with.

I want you to be able to 'converse' with the humans in a more interesting way than just hearing them spit out a pre-written canned response, e.g. ""the weather's nice"". I'm *not* creating a chat-bot, I have no interest in parsing what the player types into the game, I'm mainly interested in a silent protagonist where other character talk at you.

The world &amp; all the surrounding objects, along with the history of the world is all encoded in the game engine, so I have access to all that data. I also keep track of what each human 'knows' and 'wants'. I'm looking to take this data, and construct some semantic meaning from it based on the NPC's 'wants', then produce a syntax tree from that, which will get flattened into a (hopefully natural) sentence

Here's an example: a farmer lives in a village, and his crops are dying.

1. He knows that his crops are dying because they have no plant food
2. He knows that you can feed the plants a type of fruit
3. He knows that this type of fruit grows in the nearby forest
4. He wants to stop his plants from dying

Given this data &amp; the farmer's 'want', I'm looking to generate a sentence like 'Hello, could you get me a special fruit from the nearby forest to feed my plants?'

## The problem

The problem is I don't know the best way to represent these concepts inside a computer. I have no background in linguistics. I *believe* that I'm talking about the field of 'semantics' within linguistics, and I've found a semantics reading list on this subreddit, but I just wanted to ask around before I melt my brain on the wrong thing.

Can someone point me to a relevant field within linguistics, &amp; potentially some good resources? I'm alright at maths/logic/set theory etc, so I don't mind if a resource is heavy on these things.

""What happens to an acoustic signal after it enters the mind of a listener? Previous work has demonstrated that listeners maintain intermediate representations over time. However, the internal structure of such representations—be they the acoustic-phonetic signal or more general information about the probability of possible categories—remains underspecified. We present two experiments using a novel speaker-adaptation paradigm aimed at uncovering the format of speech representations. We exposed adult listeners (N = 297) to a speaker whose utterances contained acoustically ambiguous information concerning phones (and thus words), and we manipulated the temporal availability of disambiguating cues via visually presented text (presented before or after each utterance). Results from a traditional phoneme-categorization task showed that listeners adapted to a modified acoustic distribution when disambiguating text was provided before but not after the audio. These results support the position that speech representations consist of activation over categories and are inconsistent with direct maintenance of the acoustic-phonetic signal.""",1614219736,psychoredditling,0

linguistics,Most phonetically versatile writing system?,"Let's talk transcription.

Every writing system in the world is designed around their native language. *Transcription* is the process of converting spoken language into written characters such that an unaffiliated person is able to accurately extract the information previously exchanged. As such, we can assume that a writing system is able to transcribe more or less 100% of the phonetic information of it's intended language. That is for example; the Latin Alphabet with a few extra letters is able to transcribe basically 100% of spoken the German language.

Of course, the vast majority of scripts are also able to transcribe foreign languages they weren't meant to represent to a certain extent. A good example of this would be The Romanization of the Japanese Language; *Romaji*. In this example, the Latin script is versatile enough to represent all 46 of the existing Japanese Kana (syllable sounds) with distinct, legible spelling. As such, a literate person would be able to extract all of the original information.

This has gotten me thinking; Is there a script out there that can accurately transcribe the most of the World's major language? Sure the transcribed phonemes (spoken sounds) won't be preserved to their exact pronunciation; but as long as it's still recognizable and distinct, it can be considered a functional transcription. So my question is:

***What is the most phonetically versatile writing system? Are there any that are particularly good? (I know there's IPA but that kind of ruins the point of the question)***

Straight away we can eliminate logographic systems like Chinese Characters. A successful transcription requires approximation of the sounds of different languages, requiring spelling. Because of this, you never see any foreign transcriptions in Chinese. Interestingly, the reverse also applies; its almost impossible to informatively transcribe logographic languages using spelling since homophones will be indistinguishable without context ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion-Eating\_Poet\_in\_the\_Stone\_Den](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion-Eating_Poet_in_the_Stone_Den))

Pure syllabaries are the next to be cut. While a step above logograms, their severely limited limited list of syllabic phonemes is a glaring limitation here.

That leaves us with the scripts that have the feature we need: *Spelling*. Spelling allows the script to transcribe every possible combination of existing consonants and vowels along with other information like tonality in some scripts. This leaves 3 main groups; Alphabets, Abjads, and Abugidas; as valid candidates to answer the question.

&amp;#x200B;

What does this subreddit think? Which scripts are particularly adept at transcribing a diverse range of foreign languages? I'll be leaving my candidate in the comments to start off. 

Also, I'm not a linguist and there are probably plenty of mistakes and false assumptions in there.",1614176081,37boss15,17

linguistics,Truth conditions and modality,"Hey guys,
this year I started attending Semantics lecture. So far, we have learned two logical quantifiers, universal quantifier ∀ ""all"" and existential quantifier ∃ ""at least one"", which roughly corresponds to necessity (in all possible worlds it is true, ∀), and possibility (it is true in at least one possible world, ∃). Now, I have a sentence:

The traffic is light and he left in good time, so Jones should be home by now.

We know, that 'should' expresses possibility on a degree scale, highly likely and quite unlikely). Given the evidence, that the circumstances are right (traffic is light, Jones left in good time) we know that Jones is most certainly at home. How do we put it in truth condition? 
I tried to define it as 
♢p = ‘Jones should be home by now’ 
and ♢p &lt;-&gt; ∃w ('p is true in w')
But we are asked not to use universal or existential quantifier - ""There is another kind of modal-like meaning with epistemic and deontic versions, which also correlates with a quantifier expression (but not a logical quantifier), which roughly corresponds to a common use of the modal should.""

linguistics,"This week's Q&amp;A thread -- please read before asking or answering a question! - February 22, 2021","Do you have a question about language or linguistics? You’ve come to the right subreddit! We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

 * Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

 * Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

 * Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

 * Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

 * English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

 * Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

 * Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

 * Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

 * Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1613998817,AutoModerator,280

linguistics,Are there any languages that feature obligatory locative category but no case category?,"I'm reading an introduction to morphology, and there it takes a look at the nominal paradigms in the world. The way the book is structured is that it first goes through a lot of theoretical background, and then moves on to examples. Alas, examples may sometimes be lacking (or even absent altogether, simply listing language families proving the point), which is why I post this here.

Reviewing the nominal paradigms in the languages of the world, it states that locative and case markers are often fused together into a myriad of locative cases. Then it moves on to talk about cases where the actual case grammeme and the locative grammeme are separate and easy to identify. But if case grammemes and locative grammemes are separate entities, and there's a ton of languages where case category exsists in the absence of locative category, then there must be languages that only feature locative category in the absence of case category, right?

linguistics,Intonation / pitch research people: when and how would you convert fundamental frequency to semitones?,"Hello everyone, 

I have a quick question for you in regards to normalising f0 measurements by converting from Hz to semitones. I have a phonetic and acoustics training but hardly work with intonation or pitch. I was discussing modelling f0 differences (with linear mixed effect models) with a friend and they advised converting the raw f0 measurements from Hz into semitones. 

However, there does not seem to be a gold standard when it comes to choosing the base for the conversion. What base do you use? Is it a case-by-case decision? I feel like these conversions, while certainly useful, also add extra layers of arbitrary decisions that I think we should avoid whenever possible. 

I understand that estimates in semitones, when it comes to pitch, are easier to visualise than comparisons between raw f0 values (and also a 20Hz estimated effect will ""sound different"" at 80-100Hz rather 300-320Hz while differences in semitones are normalised), bot then why should we not aim for a gold standard of base conversion for interpretation, as well? 

Thanks and, again, I'm sorry if I said things that are incorrect. I'm as new as I could be to the topic and I'm trying to get a quick sense of general usage of this normalisation technique. Any advice, paper, etc is welcome.",1613978261,mc_anzi,2

linguistics,Questions about AAVE from a non-black person," NOTE: I am not looking for answers to all three questions, any and all answers to the questions presented are appreciated.

I am trying to learn more about language and communication, especially around those who have historically and currently had language used to marginalize and dehumanize them, such as black people in America. I am currently ignorant about a lot of aspects of African American Vernacular English, AAVE, but I hope that by asking these questions I will learn, and by learning, I hope to better support and stand in solidarity with black people and black culture. I am posting these questions to a few different subreddits – the ones I’ve determined are the most appropriate places to ask – but if there are better places to consult (both on Reddit and on the internet in general) please let me know. 

And, again, currently, I am in ignorance around this topic so I apologize in advance for any offensive and insensitive material I may unintentionally write. If I do say something insensitive, please call me out. 

Each of these questions has some context and can be further elaborated on. However, if I were to put the context for all of them, this post would be a ridiculous length. For everyone’s convenience, I will minimize the context with which each question is presented and elaborate on any specifics if/when asked.

\-**Can non-black people still use AAVE if it’s something they’ve grown up with? Similarly, what if a non-black, non-English speaker learns English with AAVE? Or, if a non-black person spends their time around black people and slowly “adopts” AAVE (as is the case in many neurodivergent people who pick up on speech patterns around them)?** I’d say in all of these instances, the speakers using AAVE are not using it to caricaturize blackness (as seen on TikTok and other areas of the internet), but as a means of communication. If AAVE is used as communication rather than caricature by a non-black person, surely it is permissible? 

\-**Following up with the first question, what exactly is code-switching? And, if you do code-switch, would it be alright so long as it’s a means of communication, much like described above?** 

\-I have heard the dehumanizing phrase “you don’t sound black” or “you look nothing like I expected, you don’t talk like a black person” said around me before. And, if I can, I’ve tried to call out the use of that phrase as dehumanizing, usually countering with “Are you saying that all black people talk the same? I didn’t know black had a sound”. But, with AAVE, this brings up some confusion. **Doesn’t the existence of African American Vernacular English necessitate that black people do speak a certain way (after all, it is** ***African American*** **Vernacular English)? Wouldn’t this saying contradict saying “I didn’t know black had a sound”?** (NOTE: I am not saying the phrase “you don’t sound black” is justified, though I am asking if AAVE negates countering with the idea that “so you think all black people sound the same?”)

\-**Lastly, shouldn’t arguments against non-black people using AAVE apply to other forms of English as well?** Though appropriating AAVE is infinitely more harmful given the marginalization of black people, isn’t it still dehumanizing to appropriate, say, a British or Australian accent for humor as you are presenting their language as a non-legitimate form of English?

linguistics,The letters Þ and Ð,"The letters þ and ð were both used in old and middle english. The the invention of the printing press and its import to England from mainland Europe both letters were removed from our language. I hope to revive these two beautiful and efficient letters now that the use of the printing press is less common.

Firstly the letter þ, this letter is called a ""thorn"" and makes a soft spoken TH sound like in the words ""Thorn"", ""Worth"" or ""Thin"". The use of TH in its place came as mainland European languages didn't use the þ sound and hence just placed two letters together. This is inefficient as there are many times when the letters T and H are together without forming the þ sound for example, ""Thomas"" ""Lighthouse"" ""Knighthood"" etc.

Next the letter ð, this letter is called an ""eth"". Like þ ""eth"" has been replaced by the digraph TH however ð makes a harder TH sound like in ""The"", ""They"" or ""That"". ð was replaced for the same reason as þ and should be revived for the same reason of efficiency and its eloquence. 

Both of these letters continue to be used in the icelandic language and can be used on phones or other systems through the installing of the icelandic keyboard.

Lower case thorn: þ
Capital thorn: Þ

Lower case eth: ð
Capital eth: Ð

I hope all of you will begin to use and spread ðe use of ðese beautiful letter. þanks for reading!",1613940914,purplefaggoteagle42,6

\* Because I do not have a ""premium"" Google account (or whatever it is called for the paid API), I do not have access to all of the features. The biggest of these is timestamps. 

Besides the payment, there are some barriers implicit to using automated translation. The biggest one is that translation engines as of now are not the best when it comes to more muddied audio. 

For instance, this translation works very well with crisp clips of one or two people speaking at turns, but loses power as background voices / noises come into play. This would best be used 

for something like getting translations of audiobooks, or podcasts (anything with very clear audio).

\* Translates audio clips!

\* Creates subtitle files for each clip!

\* Allows for translation from a source lang to a target lang! (Look at the files w/in here)

linguistics,Why does English make such extensive use of phrasal verbs?,"Hi r/linguistics,

I’m a native English speaker from the US, and I’ve recently gotten into linguistics as I find it incredibly interesting. I noticed that many non-native speakers often complain about how many phrasal verbs there are in English and I looked into it and realized that there really is an astonishing number of them (~10,000 according to google).

What I’m curious about is why they are so prevalent though. I understand that they are less formal than their one-word alternatives, but why are there so many of them when compared to other languages? What about English makes phrasal verbs so common and numerous? I’m aware of phrasal verbs in other languages (like the Scandinavian ones), but as far as I know, English has the most of any language.

I’ve tried googling this and none of the results answer the question of why English has so many or why they’re so prevalent, so I’m turning to you guys to hopefully sate my curiosity. Any sources you have that relate would be incredibly appreciated.",1613765127,Red-Quill,12
linguistics,"Do other commonly spoken languages have histories similar to English (highly influenced by invasions from different languages, dramatically changing vocabulary and grammar)?","Hello, I asked this over at /r/AskHistorians but they thought it was more appropriate for this sub. So I hope it is! I also have zero linguistics background so my apologies if I get something totally wrong. 

I've been listening to [The History of English Podcast](https://historyofenglishpodcast.com/), which has turned me on to the seemingly complex history of the English language. I'm especially interested by all the changes English went through with repeated Viking invasions (and subsequent shifts in language in  the region of the Danelaw), and of course the Norman conquest. I also appreciate learning about the history of English spelling. I've always been *terrible* at spelling, and learning all this info has actually helped me understand and appreciate English spelling better (now instead of getting annoyed at silent ""gh""s I think it's kind of cool to have these remnants of Old English still left in modern written English).  

This all seems very unique and unusual to me, but it occured to me that I don't actually know if it is. I know many languages have  been influenced by others (e.g. the Germanic and Celtic influences on French, or the Arabic influences in Spanish through the Moores), but I don't know if they compare to the impact of French or Old Norse on English. Moreover, I've been trying to learn Spanish recently, and I've noticed that words are pretty much pronounced exactly the way they're spelled (and from what I remember from the half semester I took in middle school, French is similar). I know some of this is because English adapted the Latin alphabet, which has fewer vowel sounds than English does so all the vowels letters have to work overtime, but I'm wondering if it might also have something to do with English being such a mix of other languages. 

I've done some googling around (and looked through the sub's popular questions wiki), but couldn't find an answer- so I thought I'd ask here!",1613763717,marmosetohmarmoset,9

*The background*

We currently live in France. I speak Greek/Italian/English/French. My wife speaks Italian/French/English.

So we were thinking to use the OPOL method. I will speak Greek. My wife will speak Italian. Together we will speak French. If everything goes more or less the way we want, we will introduce English at a later point (maybe after 7 yo?). We are still skeptical about introducing a third language.

Anyway, that is the idea. We know that we will find difficulties and not everything will be easy.

&gt;(1) *\*Þessi bók er auðveld að lesa* “This book is easy to read”  
(2) *\*Þessi vandi er erfiður að leysa* “This problem is hard to solve”

Instead, Icelandic has to say:

&gt;(1) *Það er auðvelt að lesa þessa bók* “It is easy to read this book”  
(2) *Það er erfitt að leysa þennan vanda* “It’s hard to solve this problem”

Icelandic also has a hard time allowing non-living subjects to be agents of certain verbs as well, for example:

&gt;(1) *?Húsið sé að skipta um eigendur* “The house is changing owners”  
(2) *?Hún horfði á hlutinn sem hendur hans ríghéldu í* “She looked at the object his hands held tight onto”

Some speakers consider these constructions to be poor Icelandic or even ungrammatical, preferring to avoid making a non-living subject an agent:

&gt;(1) *Það er eigendaskipti á húsinu* “There is a change of ownership on the house”  
(2) *Hún horfði á hlutinn sem hann ríghélt í með höndunum* “She looked at the object he held tight onto with his hands”

There's a fairly remote and very insular community of FLDS people in Southern Utah. They're a fundamentalist sect of the Mormon church that still actively practices polygamy. That aside, they have a very peculiar accent.

They also use words like ""rubbish"" instead of trash, they definitely pronounce their t's (very unusual in this region), and they sound a bit sing-song. I've honestly never heard anything like it and I wonder if it's a ""legacy"" accent, perhaps preserving 19th century pronunciation in some way.

Because of a legal crackdown, the community has been increasingly dispersing among the outlying communities, which leads me to believe that their accent is going to disappear soon.

linguistics,(from a linguistics standpoint) Would it be possible to apply the logic of surrealist art to words?,"\*Let me preface this by saying I know absolutely NOTHING about linguistics, I am however exceedingly drawn to the beauty of language and communication in differing  mediums\*

The basis of surrealist art is that drawings aren't objectively anything, simply a representation of real life objects and feelings. eg: One could draw an abhorrent representation of a tree, but as long as long said painting, is uncontestable as a tree, then that painting is of a tree. Could the same ideological motifs be applied to another medium of communication, specifically spoken or written word to create 'surreal words'  


I haven't heard of this being done before, is that because language is too different from the medium of art that those concepts can't be applied, or is it because it hasn't been explored.  


If this has been done and there's a research paper on it, I'd love for someone to link it in the comments. If it is possible but hasn't been explored, what language would be best to explore it? because I'd imagine that one with closer parallels to art would work better (my thinking being that a language that is (or at what point was) pictographic would make a lot more sense when attempting to commit this to praxis).

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

 * Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

 * Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

 * Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

 * Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

 * English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

 * Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

 * Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

 * Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

 * Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1613394023,AutoModerator,170

linguistics,"German speakers: what do we know about the usage of the word ""sich""?","Hello fellow linguists!
Last night I had a late night thought that I haven't been able to shake. As a German Native speaker learning Greek I was thinking about case systems. I realized that in German the ""Dativ"" is regularly used in a construction like ""Sie hat es einem Freund von ihr erzählt"" but you could also (to my best knowledge) say ""Sie hat es einem Freund von sich erzählt"". This got me thinking about the word ""sich"". It is normally used as a pronoun with reflexive verbs like ""sie hat sich verändert"" where it definitely is used as the ""Akkusativ"" of the 3rd person. The only other instance that I can think of where ""sich"" is used in a ""Dativkonstruktion"" is in combination with ""man"" as in ""Man erzählt sich"". And you cannot use ""sich"" as a Dativ in every instance, only when talking about a reflexive where the third person refers to themselves which makes sense. Does anybody know how it came to be, that you could use either the pronouns ""ihr/ihm/ihnen"" or ""sich"" and it doesn't really make a difference? Or am I totally wrong and it does make a difference?

linguistics,Some questions regarding the use of AAVE in comparison to other oppressed languages,"As an Asian American it’s definitely not my place to say who should and shouldn’t use AAVE, but I just have a few questions regarding the debate around AAVE. 
If many want AAVE to be legitimized as its own language (which is fair), why wouldn’t non-black people be able to use it provided they learn the history/respect the language/use it properly? The US has a long history of linguistic discrimination, which applies not just to AAVE but also the almost outright genocide of Native American languages as well as the stigma surrounding speaking nearly any language (aside from colonial ones) that isn’t English. Unless it’s being openly mocked, I haven’t seen of a debate surrounding whether white people should learn Spanish, Chinese, or even various Native American languages. Why does this then not apply to AAVE? 
Additionally, I do think it’s valid for non-black people who grew up in black neighborhoods or were otherwise primarily exposed to AAVE growing up to use it. That’s how their personal language developed and it’s not easily changeable. Kind of similar to how a white person who maybe grew up in a Chinese household would partake in cultural Chinese events. As far as the individual goes, I don’t think it’s fair to expect them to give up something they genuinely respect and grew up with.
In general I’ve been trying to reconcile the concept of language fusion with this hard stop on non-black people using AAVE. Again, AAVE should be used respectfully/correctly with understanding the history, but most people’s personal language comes from various different sources naturally; languages naturally mix and develop and I do see how some of the mixing is “artificial” (people using AAVE to seem cool), but it can also be naturally built into someone’s personal language if they get exposure to it.
I just wanted to apologize in advance if any of this came up as insensitive - this is a particular point that I don’t fully understand yet as language is complex and I think it can be much harder to tell whether something’s actually cultural appropriation as opposed to something that developed naturally.",1613288221,chliu1855,13

1. **The IPA** (International Phonetic Alphabet). It unfortunately takes a bit of effort to learn, but I am so happy I invested the time as you can use it to *read* the exact pronunciation of any English word. This is much quicker and much less error prone than hearing it pronounced.

   Learning the IPA is beyond the scope of this post, but you can find several resources online. Just know it's not something that can be done in a day, and I don't think my deck will be helpful to you until you have at least a vague idea of each phonetic symbol and its meaning.

2. **Anki**: a free flashcard app for Windows and Mac. It's the program that will show you a random word from the list, then show you the IPA and ask you if you guessed it correctly in your head. Based on your answer it automatically calculates when is the best time to ask you again.

The deck is very time consuming, expect about 20-30 hours of work to go through all of it. If you do 1 hour a day you'll be done in a month, though. I found that consistence was key.

**********

# Instructions:

1. Download Anki from [ankiweb.net](https://apps.ankiweb.net/#download)
2. Download my deck from [this link](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/116457999)
3. Launch Anki and import the deck
4. Click on the gear icon next to the deck and make sure under ""New cards"", ""Show new cards in random order"" is selected (otherwise it will show them to you in alphabetical order)
5. Since this is a very time-intensive deck, I recommend the following tweaks to make cards appear less frequently than the default.
      * In ""New Cards""
           * ""Steps (in minutes)"" enter only ""1"".
           * ""Graduating interval"" enter 5 days.
           * ""Easy interval"" enter 10 days.
           * ""Starting ease"" enter 250%.
           * If you want to remove the daily maximum number of cards Anki will show you, enter ""9999"" in ""New cards/day"".
      * In ""Reviews""
           * ""Easy Bonus"" enter 166%.
           * ""Hard Interval"" enter 120%.
           * (optional) ""Maximum reviews/day"" enter 9999 to remove Anki's limit for reviews as well.

The following is the deck description:

&gt; This is a programmatically generated deck containing the top most common 4,000 English words with their related IPA pronunciation. The words were pulled from some online resource, and then I wrote a script to query https://tophonetics.com/ to obtain the IPA for each. The settings used were American Accent without weak forms.

&gt; For some unknown reason the deck has 4,324 cards instead of 4,000; I am not sure why, but I went through the entire deck and everything looked legit with no duplicates. Maybe the site I pulled them from miscounted them, or the script also pulled the words in the rest of the page. Either way, all 4,324 cards have the correct IPA for the word.

The IPA is for the American accent, but in American English every unstressed `t` in between two vowels is pronounced as a `d`; unfortunately, those will show up as T's in the IPA. For example:

&gt; better = `ˈbɛtər`, but it should actually be `ˈbɛdər`    
&gt; attention = `əˈtɛnʃən`, which is correct and doesn't turn into a d, because the t is stressed (you can tell by the ' right before it)",1613247781,Zanziv,0

linguistics,Why no unique symbols for voiceless nasal stops?,"Hey r/linguistics! I'm a relatively new student of linguistics and I've been wondering something about voiceless nasals.  


So I know there are some languages that have them (Welsh, Icelandic, etc.) and I know they're all distinct phonemes like ⟨ɲ̊⟩ and ⟨ɲ̥⟩ because of unique articulation. To me, they just sound like puffs of air through the nose. My question is - if these are distinguishable sounds, why doesn't IPA have symbols for them like how \[t\] and \[d\] are distinct even though one is voiced and one isn't? I know you can write them with diacritics, I'm just curious if there's any particular reason nasal stops get different treatment from alveolar stops (or any other kind of stop)

I'm a few generations removed from my ancestors, and am interested in learning more about their history and culture, and am wondering if there is anything in the field of linguistics on the Ruthenian language/people.  I'm a little confused on the differentiation between the [Ruthenian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruthenian_language) language and [Rusyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusyn_language) language, but I think I'm looking for info on Rusyn. Though, if I'm understanding things correctly, Ruthenian may refer to the predecessor to or larger group of languages which Rusyn falls under? (For what it's worth, my grandmother (born in US, parents born in Poland/Slovakia) said she spoke Ukrainian, but while similar to Ukrainian, I *think* it was actually Rusyn/Ruthenian).  

While not in the field now, I was an anthro major in college, so am most interested in the socio/anthro/cultural aspects of linguistics. I only took one linguistics class in college, but do listen to a few linguistics podcasts and have read some lay-person-level linguistics books. So it'd be great if any recommendations are something a lay person or a lay person+ can understand. 

Problems I foresee with this request: 1. This is a small and dying language.  2. I only speak English.  If those are hurdles for recommending things, would love to hear recommendations for the broader East Slaivc languages, or [closely related(?)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ur4rTOp-dbBkmDx9GUZlQB-TzWM8Z0Skfl39bS_GhJGNI45cn1Jq2JtQVDLYi_AZUEqRdQE2q9jQSOtp9XVlKwsH1DfTtyW0mLNpoxdBI8y6uBZKw0qFiU0xQyjWyy50bHw9mVc9hkKQShYKQdVN246Ak9Jjy8j4QaKo5ggqFxZz0P1GSHineClkELFUU127) Ukrainian language.

linguistics,Is the IPA outdated/archaic in some ways?,"I've studied linguistics as a hobbyist for many years now.  I teach English  and study Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese) and have dabbled in several other languages. I also have many friends from all over the world whom I often communicate with. American English is my mother language. That's my language background.

I've used IPA on occasion and it's sometimes useful for helping beginners in English with their pronunciation but as a practical tool for learner's as opposed to academics it often feels like too much trouble  for little reward. Once students learn pronunciation patterns (mostly from hearing)  they tend to not need IPA again. 

For common usage, when other English  speakers want to tell each other how to pronounce something they usually just use more conventional methods like a rhyming word or common pronunciation patterns such as  ee for E   gee for G  ah for a soft A and so fourth. They just don't use IPA and are confused when they see IPA symbols in the wild.

For some language types I find it far from adequate such as addressing tonal languages. I'm sure Chinese language scholars would agree as they've developed their own phonic systems for pronunciation.

Isn't the whole point of the IPA to have a practical universal system of pronouncing all the sounds in human language? 

The IPA developed the characters  and described how they're pronounced along with  a slew of symbols to modify them. But then when you pick up a language learning book they seem rarely used.  And IPA as an organization doesn't seem to be advancing  ways to actually use the IPA... 

Text to voice programs are a very useful tool. Yet there is no universal program that does this with IPA very well.  I have a player character in a role playing game whose name is Adnijlapug. People always ask me how to pronounce it.  If I type out ædnid͡ʒləpəg they probably still won't get it.  If they copy paste it in the  only two text to speech tools that can be found reasonably with google the first one won't be correct at all and the next will sound ok.   However if I type out adneege'lapug most people will get it right and the many text to speech programs out there will pronounce it correctly in a much more natural sounding  way than the IPA options available.

It just seems like tech companies just trying to make good speech  AI  are doing a way better job in giving people practical more accurate language tools than an organization that's been around for over 100 years.

I'll note, I'm not referring to languages under any threat of extinction, I'm talking about communities prone to assimilation. Specifically, I'm thinking about the case of Spanish in California. Now, there are special places in my heart for some of California's many other languages, but Spanish could be large enough to rival English, to the degree that we could, in time, become a bilingual state, rather than one with a dominant and a minority language, in which heritage speakers tend to lose the language and assimilate to the dominant one, out of stigma. There are no universities in which Spanish is the language of instruction, despite millions of speakers -- nor is there much in the way of public schools in Spanish.

Now, I don't want to replace Spanish -- to do so would be a disservice to Californians, since the rest of the US is primarily anglophone. But I would like to see us become a bilingual state.

linguistics,"The psycholinguistics , of bizarre, punctuation .. ??","But there is a certain random subset of people I have sometimes texted with whose punctuation makes no sense. They aren’t from a particular dialect or socioeconomic stratum, they’re often somewhat educated or well off. It’s not a second language issue because even if it is more common among second language speakers their patterns don’t correspond to conventions from their L1’s written standard at all, and they have the same problem there. They may even spell everything correctly and use decent grammar. But the punctuation is... apparently bizarrely random. And it’s often hard to see the thought process behind their choices. What,, is..going on I don’t , understand ?

But I do note that such people seem to have what I *perceive* to be some similarities of personality or intellectual ability in certain specific ways. But I also don’t want to jump to conclusions. Does anyone know any research about this, or on whether it correlates to particular personality types or conditions (I recently saw a post on here about how writing style and personality disorders can correlate, for example), and how their thought process with regard to punctuation even works? (I’d almost want to ask some of them but this wouldn’t be very polite.)

DISCLAIMER: So I don’t want this to come across judgemental or prescriptivist, and this relates very specifically to the punctuation of a particular writing system (that of English) rather than any natural language as such, but I think the question is still valid. 

And the rules of punctuation can be subtle and hard, and differ from standard language to standard language even within those that use the Roman alphabet. But even then I’d expect the ‘wrong’ choices to make some intuitive sense, or for them to avoid punctuation altogether. Children make grammatical errors that make sense and are consistent in their own way. This seems entirely inconsistent.",1612989601,Harsimaja,74

linguistics,Poetry and song in non-configurational languages?,"Hey guys.

Something that seems universal about poetry and song is that it follows a set of rules, whether that be rhyme, number of syllables/morae per line, or which syllables take stress. The trick to writing poetry, from what I understand, is syntax - making sentences that both fit within the poetical ruleset used while not breaking the syntactic rules of the language written in. You're making your language beautiful by revealing hidden structures within it. You are calling attention to language as an artform by working within the boundaries of the given language.

In non-configurational languages, syntax is, well, not really important. I can't speak for all languages described as non-configurational, but in Jingulu there are very, very few restraints on which words can go where. Adverbs have preference to specific placements, nested clauses are extremely rare, and interrogative words always occur at the periphery of clauses. Apart from that anything goes, really. Word order is ""random"" in the sense that it doesn't cause any change in meaning or focus.

This means that one of the main problems in poetical structure goes right out the window. Other stuff like extensive null-anaphora and so on probably also changes things up.

So my question is:

Does anybody know of any studies on the structure of poetry  and song in non-configurational languages? Obviously they still exist, but I imagine they must be very different from  in configurational languages. I haven't been able to find anything on Jingulu yet.",1612969255,SarradenaXwadzja,18

linguistics,Question about default word for animals in languages with grammatical gender,"Hello, fellow redditors!

I am a native Russian speaker, and was wondering what other languages with gender do about default ways of referring to animals. For example, in Russian there are separate words for a male and female animal (not all, but most common ones), i.e. собака is a female dog and пёс is a male dog. By default, domestic animals are referred to using the word for a female animal. If I see a random dog, I immediately think собака. On the other hand, wild animals are usually referred to with the male word, i.e. a random wolf is волк, not волчица (unless an animal has distinctive features, like lion and lioness, лев and львица).

Of course, there are exceptions, for example, geese. A goose is generally гусь and not гусыня, while duck is by default утка and not селезень.

So, I wonder what is the general tendency in other languages with grammatical gender (like French, German etc.), and would appreciate it if you point me to some materials to read about it further.

linguistics,baby method: an alternative to the conventional way,"Hello everyone,

I am very passionate with language learning

At a young age, I hated studying for english or french, I hated the homework, hated the process, hated everything involved

As I grew older I realized that a brilliant method for language learning is the '**baby method**'  in other words, you learn as the babies learn their mother's tongue by  exclusively focusing on the inputs. The name of the method is something I  came up with and by no means is not a trademark, logo, or a title of a  sales pitch. I merely use it metaphorically to show an alternative to  the traditional &amp; outworn way of teaching

You  see, babies are receptors of all the information which appears in their  surroundings. Similarly, the language learner by prioritizing on the  input / expose him/herself to material of the target language will  eventually

Input = listening, reading

Output = speaking, writing

Mimicking  the method babies are interacting with their environment, does not mean  that an adult will be exposed to babies toys or learning the colors.  Quite the contrary, an adult learner will access to the reading &amp;  listening material of his choice from the get-go! Technology is an ally  on that endeavor, as nowadays we have podcasts, audio-books, subtitled  vlogs etc

As you expose to more  and more content, your ears &amp; eyes naturally familiarize with the  language you want to learn. Working hand-in-hand with acquiring new  words as you slowly progress and revising them in frequent intervals,  the 'baby method' worked wonders for me!

The  grammar and other semantics can wait ! As you gain more exposure to the  language, you can purchase a grammar book studying the rules of the  language  and you will witness that things fall in the right place

I hope you find this helpful, I am curious to hear which methods suit you best

Point #1) 

So... secret time... as a young person (perhaps 15 to 25?), I had ""overactive sweatglands"" and this led to insanely embarrassing humungous sweat stains under my arms, which led to me wearing thick hoodies (in the summer) and any type of shirt that was less sweat-showy than others. 

WTF does this have to do w/ linguistics? 

At the time, I told NO ONE about this, but had a secret lang w/ myself, I'd call it ""sweat through"" when a shirt was visibly (yucky word coming...) ""moist"" or, let's be real, ""wet"". 

So... in my head, I'd say ""I sweat through this shirt, I'll put on a hoody before going into school"" or whatever... and I'm not convinced that ALL those words went through my head, but I know that the phrase ""sweat through"" was used and it was used ONLY in my head because that was my secret! 

I'm assuming we all have words in our heads that are used to situate thoughts in our heads that we never necessarily utter. But the fact that this word was created by me and ONLY for me seems relevant. 

So... if we create terms in our heads for us to situate thoughts in our heads, is language, partly used to help us organize our own thoughts? 

&amp;#x200B;

Point #2) 

I spent 5 years living in Taiwan and (unlike MANNNY of the Western visitors that lived there) communicating and living life nearly 100% in Mandarin. And though I was fairly proficient in the language, it was ALWAYS quite foreign to me, ALWAYS energy intensive, and thus ALWAYS noticeable when I was using the language. For example, as I write this in my native language, the words come effortlessly and quicker than my fingers (or mouth) can dispense them. This was never true in Mandarin. 

And because it took effort, I noticed that, often when beginning my day, I'd lay out my ""plan of attack"" in my head in Mandarin. ie, ""First I'll brush my teeth, than I'll make eggs and bacon, then I'll go to 7-11 for a coffee, then, etc."" And I would slip into English when in need of a word, ie I will ""fry the eggs until a little bit runny"" (how TF do you say ""a little bit runny"" in Mandarin, so that part of the sentence would be code switched. 

Anyway, this stunted form or thought to internal speech processing demonstrated to me that there was, in fact,  thought to internal speech processing.

linguistics,Advice on how to approach regularizing old nahuatl texts.,"I'm active in the nahuatl (a native mesoamerican language) community and we regularly have debates over orthography/romanization.

Throughout the colonial period it was unusual to mark long vs short vowels (even in texts written by Nahuas themselves) because the distinction was not one that the Spaniards were accustomed to (or in many cases, even recognized.) 

In an effort to revitalize and regularize these texts, there is an effort by us to update them with a more “accurate” orthography—particularly re-macronizing all the long vowels. This is where I'd like some guidance from y'all.

You see, long vowels at the end of a word were no longer pronounced short by the time the Spanish came. Because of this, some people want to indicate this lack of pronunciation by removing macrons on all word-final vocables—even if they are supposed to “grammatically” have them.

But when adding suffixes to words (nahuatl is agglutinative) those long vowels “reappear” and it can be confusing for newcomers to the language to parse words in their various concatenations.

This is probably an age-old debate, and I know spelling can be all over the place, particularly for a native language that was never standardized to begin with! But in the pursuit of revitalization efforts and regularizing the text of this treasure trove of literature, what advise do y'all have for me?

Should we mark features even if they're not “supposed” to be pronounced? Should we write it more closely to the way it was/is spoken? Would marking long vowels “no-matter-what” be an example of what another commentator called: “Reformist purism winning over archaizing purism”?",1612802018,w_v,5

linguistics,"I want to help research, publicize and bring awareness to minority languages in the Middle East and North Africa. What should I study and how do I go about it?","I can speak some languages of Iraq and I want to help promote the native and minority languages of the region.

Unfortunately, due to government policies of Arabization, Kurdification, Turkification and other such things, minority languages like Assyrian and Mandean Aramaic, Berber languages, and even Arabic dialects are heavily marginalized or suppressed. 

There is almost no material for learning these languages and most people don't even know what these languages are or that they exist.

Even worse is that many native speakers don't even know how to read and write their languages or think that their native tongue is ""slang"" or ""bad"" because of government propaganda that tells them so. They sometimes even think their languages don't have ""grammar"" or ""rules"" because there isn't a standard written form.

So, I would really like to help this. I would like to research these languages (including small dialects), promote them and develop material to show others about them.

How do I go about this? What do I need to study? What do I need to do? I know traveling is out of the question for now but I assume technology will help with communicating with natives as I do know many myself.

linguistics,Looking for a native linguistics text for Japanese,"When I was in France, I took a class on French grammar, which was the first time I’d learned about the language from native speakers who had studied the language. We referenced [this textbook](https://www.amazon.fr/Grammaire-méthodique-français-Martin-Jean-Christophe/dp/2130800602/ref=mp_s_a_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=grammaire+française&amp;qid=1612356974&amp;sr=8-4). I feel like it really boosted my French knowing _why_ certain things were the way they were in grammar, rather than just having the rules told to me with no explanation. I also took a class on Old French, where we looked at historical phonetics and etymology, and read Old French texts, which also really helped with my understanding of the way the language worked.

What I’m wondering is if there’s a textbook like this in Japanese, made for Japanese speakers in university.

linguistics,Why is it that English does not distinguish between different levels of formality in speech as Japanese and Korean and other languages?,"French has some formality with ""tu"" and ""vous"", as well as Spanish with ""tu"" and ""usted"", so this isn't strictly a feature of Asian languages and culture or a non-European thing. I see people calling some forms of formal speech in English as ""professional"", but even though English does not distinguish by formal and informal pronouns,  there are different levels to formality that exists in English which are usually not distinguished (or taught to be distinguished, in English classes at schools). 



For example, there's a difference between ""Hello, how are you?"" (Formal/Professional) and ""Hey, how are you?"" (Formal/Polite) and ""Hey, how you doin'?"" (Informal/Polite) and ""What's good?"" (Very informal).


*Edit: It turns out that ""Hello, how are you?"" is neutral, not formal, while ""Good [Morning/Afternoon/Evening], how do you do?"" is the formal form. I heard ""Good afternoon"" before and ""how do you do"" but schools don't usually teach people to distinguish between formal and informal and neutral speech (I'm a native speaker from the US).*",1612330274,smilelaughenjoy,316

linguistics,Notation for rhyme,"[Rhyme](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rhyme) (in the sense of ""sameness of sound of part of some words"") is one of the most-noticed features of poetry and lyrics. I find the terminology though to be clunky and insufficient. Here's a [pre-/protological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protologism) notation for rhyme using the [""typical model"" of syllables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable#Typical_model) \- composed of an onset, nucleus, and coda.

Simply, each component is reduced to a letter: x = different, o = same, s = similar. If a rhyme is across multiple syllables, they're separated by dashes.

Some examples:

* bat, bake: oxx
   * Same onset (/b/), different nucleus (/æ/, /eɪ/), different coda (/t/, /k/)
* streak, squeak: soo
   * Similar onset (/stɹ/, /skw/), same nucleus (/i/) and coda (/k/)
* skillet, cellar: sxo-oxx
   * First syllable with similar onset (/sk/, /s/), different nucleus (/ɪ/, /ɛ/), same coda
   * Second syllable with same onset (/l/), different nucleus and coda

Compared to spoken language, when notating writing with this, it mainly shows the reader's impression of how the words are pronounced - pronunciation varies based on the dialect, person, context, and so on.

Looking for feedback/criticism. Is there something existing like this?

Edits:

* Removed dashes between components - unnecessary noise. Instead, syllables are separated by dashes.
* Quoted wiktionary definition of rhyme rather than putting it in my own words.
* Added more examples.

linguistics,We know that developing literacy in your first language is an important foundation for developing literacy in a second language. What happens in diglossic communities where the colloquial language is spoken at home and a prestige language is learned for reading and writing in school?,"I remember learning in school that developing a student's first language literacy was an foundation for developing literacy in a second language. I learned this in the context of ESL teaching where immigrant students in America, for example, who had built literacy skills in their first language were much more successful in developing literacy skills in English. Students who had no foundations in literacy in their first language, would struggle to develop literacy in English, because not only are they learning how to read and write for the first time, they're having to learn a new language.

This got me thinking about diglossic communities, specifically Arabic speaking communities where colloquial dialects are used in every day life and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is used in print, academia, and the media. Conceivably, Arabic speaking kids learn to read and write MSA in school but, MSA is often VERY different from the colloquial dialects (for example, Moroccan Arabic and MSA are mutually intelligible).

So how does this affect education in these communities? What effect, if any, would this have on the adult reading population?

Edit: The thing that made me think of this question is a friend of mine who grew up in Tunisia. She spoke Tunisian Arabic as a first language. Tunisian Arabic is sort of a combination of MSA and French but sufficiently different from both of them to require serious study to learn. Now, as an adult, she says she's most comfortable reading in French. But she didn't start learning French until she was 9 years old. Before that she read in MSA, which isn't her first language. Tunisian isn't a written language. 

I guess I just can't imagine being MOST comfortable reading in a language that isn't my first language, no matter how proficient I am. I have to think that my friend's early experiences reading have had a negative effect on her literacy as an adult. But how can an entire country or community have this problem. I must be missing something. Help me find it!",1612267082,TheLongWay89,10

linguistics,Is illiteracy a bigger problem for languages without a phonetic writing system?,"In English, you have words like ""through, rough and though"" that have the same ending - ough - but different pronunciations. This mismatch between letters and sounds is fairly common in English, but not so much in Spanish. This is why my mother was able to teach me how to read Spanish in less than 10 minutes when I was a little girl - she taught me the alphabet, and showed me the sounds each letter made, and that was it.... I was able to match the letters and the sounds to the words I was reading, and I completely understood the meaning since I already knew how to speak the language (my parents didn't know a word of English).

Since I was raised in the US, I barely read any Spanish material growing up; last month, however I decided to start reading Harry Potter in Spanish. At first it was difficult to get my eyes adjusted to the new language, but eventually I got comfortable and I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book. Sure there were plenty of vocabulary words I didn't know, but most of the time I didn't even bother looking them up because it wasn't enough to detract from the story. This made me wonder - how can I, someone who has barely read any Spanish material in her life, and only learned how to read Spanish from a 5 minute explanation my mom gave me when I was a little girl, able to read an entire ass book in another language?

And then it got me thinking - why is illiteracy such a problem? Assuming that people who are illiterate are perfectly able to *speak* the language, why cant they just match the letters with the sounds they make and just... read? Is it because English spellings don't always match with a particular sound?

One of the reasons why I think this is that my mother stopped going to school in the 6th grade in a 3rd world, Latin-American country, and she still knows how to read. I can tell she struggles - she always has to read out loud, and her sentences always sound choppy when she does - but still, she can read enough to function in daily life. Yet, I am seeing these videos of illiterate people in America who went to school for 10, 12 years, but didn't learn how to read.

Another theory I have is that maybe because I am such a voracious reader in English, that maybe reading *itself* is a transferable skill, even if it is in another language. Is this it? Is reading - the physical act of seeing symbols and connecting them to meaning - like a muscle that gets stronger the more you use it?",1612264411,maria_esmeralda,175

First off, the absolute last thing I want to do is disrespect anyone, it is why I am asking this. I'm white and don't want to accidentally use language I shouldn't. I will admit however, to not being as educated on this topic as I could be, so if I am stepping on toes here or anything I truly apologize, if you let me know I will correct my mistakes and not repeat them in the future.

So on with the actual question now. I have noticed that a lot of common vocabulary in internet culture originates from AAVE, I would like to stay away from those terms as, like I said before, I am white. I don't want to appropriate language and I don't want to be disrespectful to anyone. Problem is, I don't know which words and terms I should be avoiding. I know some that are well known as being AAVE and some that I have seen pointed out in twitter threads. I'm always nervous I will accidentally say something I shouldn't without knowing it is AAVE though.

I have tried to look for some sort of list of what parts of the language we see on the internet are AAVE and which parts are okay for me to use but haven't been able to find much. I know that a comprehensive list would likely be difficult to keep with how rapidly online speak seems to evolve but if there is one and someone could direct me to it I would be very thankful. If there isn't one, some resources that might be helpful in identifying what words and phrases originate from AAVE would also be helpful.

But where did all these separate families of languages come from? Was there really this kind of linguistic diversity in the peoples who walked over the ice age land bridge from Siberia? I could understand there being different languages among those peoples, but could there really be that many (presumably) unrelated FAMILIES of languages in Eastern Siberia at the time? I imagine that the population of this area would have been low and the languages all more or less related in a small number of families, similar to the more modern Turkic or Inuit languages families from similar regions.

Did these unrelated families develop from languages which WERE related, once upon a time? Is that possible?

Are linguists just forced to list more language families because language/culture loss has deprived them of the material to link some of them into larger families?

One of the books is ""The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World"" by  James Mallory  and it's really great as it explains the topic from the very beginning. I came across this excerpt and I can't really understand it:

https://preview.redd.it/29flq30t0we61.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae5f22d6b6f89080ef797ce939cb26a3ee8f6a54

I have several question concerning this excerpt: 

1. Why these three Latin words considered to have three different velars while both *centum* and *coxa* seems to have regular /k/. I could agree that *quod* is probably pronounced as /kʷ/.  I could also guess that one of these velars (vel^(1) or vel^(2)) is probably palatalized /kj/ but I don't know how we can be so sure here.
2. Why is Sanskrit &lt;ś&gt; here considered to be velar sound. Isn't it /ɕ/, thus alveolo-palatal?
3. It says that PIE had more velars than its daughter languages and okay, let's assume it's true but how can we say that PIE had velars without ever hearing it or even having any texts written in it? I know there are certain phonological rules which enable us to predict some sounds but the difference between /k/, /k^(j)/, and /k^(w)/ is, in my opinion, so meager that it seems quite far-fetched theory. 

Could someone explain how such reconstruction works in reality?",1612195304,SoobPL,15

 * Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

 * Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

 * Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

 * Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

 * English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

 * Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

 * Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

 * Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

 * Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1612184421,AutoModerator,306
linguistics,"Reading on language peeving / shaming (in general, but esp re: minority languages if possible)","Hi, I'm doing an undergrad in minority language development and I'm looking for reading recommendations that deal with language peeving or shaming.

By ""peeving"" I mean the subjective disparaging or shaming of other people's ordinary language practices.

Anything touching on the wider subject (ideologies behind, effect of etc) would be helpful, but especially so in the context of minority language revitalisation if anything that specific exists.

I'm not having the best of luck, but poss not using the best search terms.

linguistics,Do distributed semantic word embeddings such as word2vec have a theoretical foundation in linguistics?,"My understanding is that they evolved out of the desire to model n-grams or word sequences as evidenced by much of the background presented in [this seminal paper](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf). 

Researchers eventually realized that these distributed representations which are trained on the context of words turn out to be pretty good proxies for the actual meaning of a word. My question is, has there been any formal research from the linguistics/semantics side into whether these are valid models of word meaning?

I know that many computational linguists still use WordNet and other semantic graphs for modeling meaning, but vectors are much more apt for machine learning which is why you don't see those graphs catching on in modern statistical NLP. If there isn't any formal semantics research into word embeddings, why does modeling the representation of a word based on its context turn out to be so good at predicting its meaning?

When I really think about it, it's still kind of crazy to me that 'king' - 'man' + 'woman' = 'queen', when each of their vectors are just based on their respective contexts in a huge corpus of English text.

linguistics,Why is machine learning not more popular in phonology?,"Hello everyone !

While studying phonology I've started to wonder, if there has ever been an attempt to analyse the logic of phonology by means of machine learning. What I mean is: couldn't a phonology be described as a set of functions, determined by an algorithm from the phonetic derivations of a corpus of phonological representations ? I can think of at least two good reasons to try:

1. Since phonology has an internal logic it would be possible to automatise the description of a language-specific phonology, if only there's sufficient data. It seems field linguists still often do that work by hand, and it feels like this can be simplified a lot.
2. In case of disputes over existing phonologies, like those of bigger languages it could help in providing evidence for and against certain theories by analysing their logical contradictions. (Just to give an example: one could quantify if skeleton representation or moras make more sense for a given language, by testing which of the two leads to less precise predictions) 

I've searched around a bit and only found a few papers on this topic, which seem to have yielded successes, but to my knowledge there isn't a tool around that is used for this in practise. Is there a problem I'm not seeing? I've tried to do it for small testing Sets, like ones from exercises in a phonology textbook, of course making this into something serious would need a lot of work.",1612113471,Shiniri,26

linguistics,How can you fix language-confused people or brain problems?,"I grew up in 3 countries and spent my formative years moving around. I picked up 2 major Asian languages and English. But none of the 3 I would say I've mastered them like a local person. People can tell that I'm not a local. I do speak, read and write very well in all 3. Enough to carry a normal life, read newspapers/textbooks and have deep conversations there. But I'm not at the native level !! It feels horrible! Because people would always treat me like an outsider. 

I find it hard to find others who share the same struggle and can understand me with my issue. I've met many people, for example, Europeans who are multilingual, but not feeling the same way as I do. 

I think many of them are not in the same boat because the languages they speak are quite similar - through my eyes. (i.e. A German person speaking English. Both languages are from the same continent, sharing roots, &amp; using alphabets etc). I think perhaps that makes it less confusing? I don't know. 

Asia and Europe are furthest from each other. So I think the language is also furthest from each other in terms of structures n whatnot. What I'm trying to say is, how can I fix my problem? I think my language confusion is more serious than how most others struggle. So I couldn't find the helps I needed. I really want to master at least 1 so I could have roots in the society where I live in. It feels awful to be treated like an outsider everywhere and all the time! I want a home! 

I feel the language department in my brain is so messed up. Share your thoughts, please!

linguistics,How much did CJK/East Asian languages influence each other vocally/when speaking?,"I’m not quite sure if this is the right sub so please let me know where I can ask this and delete this post if I’m in the wrong sub thanks.

Anyways my question is, Are there many words in East Asian/CJK languages that sound and have the same definition or is it only a tiny portion.

I am not really into linguistics and don’t know much about languages and their history so please excuse me if my question and post sounds really uneducated or rookie.

I am aware of East Asian history and the influence he Chinese language had on neighbourhood countries and their languages. However, I am curious about influential it is. Mainly in vocal/speaking

I’ve been watching a lot of Asian dramas and anime and have noticed some words that have the same meaning and sound almost the same in the languages I speak(Cantonese and Mandarin) for example I heard “sun” in Japanese, I am not sure how to spell it but it sounded very very close to sun in mandarin and Cantonese that I could notice it without subtitles. 

Another example is apple. In Japanese it’s “ringou” also very very close to Cantonese and mandarin I had to replay a couple a times to realise the “r” isn’t a “p”

Last example is “this/these ones”. I heard it in a Korean in a kdrama and it sounded like Cantonese when I heard it. I am not sure how to spell it in either languages but if I were to guess it was pronounced “yee gou” in both languages.

So how much did the CJK influence each other in terms of speaking? And what are some other words in these languages that sound the same and mean the same thing? I know the writing was influenced by Chinese but I never knew that they had words that meant and sounded the same.",1612100073,Uneemate,13

I had a project called QuestGuide -- a powerful research tool for normal people -- that I was going to do some time ago, but ... life happened. It's a huge project and, at 71, I just don't have the energy to do it.

The domains are:

+ questguide.com
+ questguide.org
+ questguide.net

Anyway, I will *give* these domains to someone who can make the case that they will use them for the betterment of all mankind, or something like that.

Things to note:

+ You need to convince me you're not going to just turn around and sell them. I will vet what you say. Note: I do not feel obligated to give these to just anybody. 

+ These domains are all close to expiring and so may be in the ""zone"" that excludes quick transfers, but that can be dealt with.

+ If you actually want to *do* the QuestGuide project, or something like it, your name goes to the top of the list. I don't expect too many *qualified* takers on this; it's a nontrivial project requiring an broad array of skills far beyond simply doing a quicky WordPress website.

linguistics,Does the orthography of a language change the way people speak it?,"In General, I am trying to understand whether the written form of a language can extend into the verbal form so that it changes the way people speak.

From what I can tell, there are different ways this can happen (which are completely theorized by me, and so I don't know if they are the true reason people started speaking as such): 

* when people begin speaking in acronyms or written abbreviations, like when people started verbally saying &lt;k&gt; instead of &lt;ok&gt; after people started to write is as the one letter
* When sounds not written in words began being dropped verbally as well. Like in Arabic, the colloquial dialects dropped almost all the cases, which could be because they do not appear in written Arabic

So in general, what I'm asking is whether those sound and grammatical changes are due to the orthography, or something else, and if there are other ways orthography can influence speech.",1612024333,MaeenTell,132

linguistics,“Not very good” in non-English languages,"So our definition of the phrase, “not very good,” would be to say that something/someone is actually the opposite of “good.” Without context, this doesn’t make a whole ton of sense, as one wouldn’t be wrong to assume that someone/something that isn’t very good could actually be just “good enough”. For example, if I say, “I’m not very good at piano,” it would be taken to mean that I’m actually a poor pianist, rather than someone who is good, just not *very* good. Many [online dictionaries](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/thesaurus-category/british/not-very-good) would list this definition. Now, as a statement in English, this doesn’t matter much to me. Phrases take on unintuitive meanings in the evolution of language. However, I’m confused as to how a phrase like “not very good” is also used in non-English languages. Was this borrowed from English, or did it evolve separately. For example, in Spanish, one might say, “yo no ingles muy bien,” which carries the exact same meaning when translated to English, despite. Can anyone help me figure out how this happened? Am I totally lost here, or does this make sense?

Also, I guess we can say “not very [adjective]” takes on a meaning that’s the opposite of whatever that adjective is, like a mean person being described as, “not very nice.”

linguistics,What's up with this sound-change I've been noticing among some (esp. young and female-identifying) pop singers/singer-songwriters?,"I've noticed a pretty distinctive sound across a couple different groups of people, but I've noticed it most in younger female(-identifying) pop singers and singer/songwriters. The best way I can describe it is the Lorde sound, because that's the first place I remember really noticing it, but I did notice it among people I knew who were singer-songwriters before then. The question, before I go into what it is I think I'm hearing is, where is this coming from? It reminds me of the [pop punk accent](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/i-made-a-linguistics-professor-listen-to-a-blink-182-song-and-analyze-the-accent) a little bit, but I haven't been able to find quite so clear &amp; satisfying an answer.

If you're not familiar, [Royals](https://youtu.be/cVWOEx4Xdhs)'s maybe the most well-known Lorde song, so this is what I'll use to try to point out what I mean. In the beginning (0:01) when she says ""flesh,"" it sounds more like  /flɛeːʃ/ or /flɛɪːʃ/ as opposed to what I would expect, /flɛːʃ/. Same thing happens with ""address"" (0:14). What sounds to me like the most obvious time this shows up is what she says ""we don't *care*"" (0:41, but it happens a lot), it sounds like it's almost turning into /kiɪːɹ/ as opposed to /kɛːɹ/. More generally, I can't *quite* place the difference, but there are a lot of places where it sounds she's pushing all her vowels and consonants up and forward in her mouth, and a lot of her /r/ s sound really under-pronounced. For an even clearer example imo, check out her song [Teams](https://youtu.be/zTz_qdgEgMg), she does it right from the start and when she says ""graces"" (0:08) her /r/ sounds real off to me.

Now, Lorde is from New Zealand, and I know the way they pronounce their /r/ s over there is really interesting, so I thought, hey, maybe it's just her accent. But then I kept running into similar sounds from people who had a more ""standard"" American accent! Here are some more examples:

[Slow Dancing by Aly &amp; AJ](https://youtu.be/poaP-o8klRM), right at the beginning, I can't help but notice it, when the singer says ""it's been days and weeks and *months*,"" that months sounds funky! The /ʌ/ sound in ""month"" is getting turned into a diphthong so it sounds like sounds like /mʌiːnθs/ or /mʌɪːnθs/.

Aly &amp; AJ are American! There's no accent excuse! One more example so you believe I'm not crazy (also by a young female American singer):

[drivers license by Olivia Rodrigo](https://youtu.be/ZmDBbnmKpqQ): this sounds really similar to Lorde's pronunciation to me--for almost the whole song it sounds like she's pronouncing things really high and forward. I can't quite pick out sounds well enough to try to transcribe it, but some points that stand out to me are the refrain--""you said forever, now I drive alone past your street"" (0:25)--and most of the second verse (starting immediately after). I've tried but I can't *quite* pick out what specifically is happening, it's like a combination of under-pronouncing some of her /r/ s like Lorde, and adding that weird /i/ or /ɪ/ diphthong like the Aly &amp; AJ example (or sounding like she's about to start but then not following through). I'm also noticing something that may have been true with Lorde as well, which is that it sounds almost like she's pronouncing her /n/s as /ŋ/. So maybe not all the sounds are *forward* necessarily, but they feel at least more...tense? Or just oddly-placed.

I won't go into detail but here are some runners-up of songs I also noticed this or something like this in (t o varying degrees) but that didn't seem consistent or strong enough for me to include as primary examples:

* [idontwannabeyouanymore by Billie Eilish](https://youtu.be/MDedqBwm-yI) (the initial vocalizations, the /r/ thing on ""fall apart twice a day"" and ""show never tell"", and like everything again on the pre-chorus and even more-so on the chorus)
* [Habits (Stay High) by Tove Lo](https://youtu.be/2V01j6bMYJg) (""watching freaky people getting it on"" has that /i/-ness at the end of the vowels a little)
* [Cups by Anna Kendrick](https://youtu.be/cmSbXsFE3l8) (every time she says ""when I'm gone"" she does a little of that diphthong-ization thing)
* [Let's Be Still by The Head and the Heart](https://youtu.be/j0hbnlbRXjk) is actually one of the most egregious examples of this, but I didn't think of it until after I wrote most of this so I'm relegating it down here :(. Also there's enough differences that it makes me think maybe the singer of the second verse just has an accent).

BONUS: When I was trying to see if anyone had asked this before, I found [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/5ypdnc/provenance_of_hipsinging_accent/) similar thread but pointing out a common sound among female singers in a different genre--it's not *exactly* the same sound, but it sounds like it has a lot of similar elements! I don't know if it's relevant but it's definitely interesting. (That thread references [Blood in the Cut by K.Flay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2WcOdz96ko) and [Help I'm Alive by Metric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxNybAURoDQ)).

linguistics,What is known about the lects spoken by the Celtic Britonians?,"For those who are unaware, Britonia was a Brythonic Celtic settlement in northern Galicia, Spain, founded by Britons fleeing the Anglo-Saxon settlement of England. In this respect it was much like Breton, but unlike Breton the Britonians were eventually absorbed by the surrounding population. 

Britonia emerged during the late 5th and early 6th centuries AD, in what was then the Kingdom of the Suebi. Britonia was first acknowledged at the First Council of Lugo in 569 AD, and a man named “Mailoc” was nominated as a separate bishop. 

Quoting Wikipedia “The diocese was suppressed in 716. The line of (errant?) bishops of Britonia nevertheless existed at least until 830, when the area was attacked by the Vikings; it may have continued as late as the Council of Oviedo in 900.”

The only words, or descendants of words, from this lect I could find are the name of the settlement itself: “Britonia” (Bretoña in Galician and Castilian/Spanish), as well as of the following Britonian bishops: 

• “Mailoc”
• “Metopius”
• “Sonna”
• “Susa”
• “Bela”

These are almost certainly Latinized, except perhaps “Mailoc”, given the lack of a latinized Nominative ending.

I’m particularly wondering how much Britonian diverged from Breton, Welsh, Cornish, etc., and if we have any further evidence about it at all.",1611893666,James-Bancroft,0

I know it exists and is very common in Mandinka (Senegal/Gambia dialects at least, haven't looked into it yet for other Manding languages like Bambara, Jula, Eastern Malinke, Soninke, Bobo, Bissa, etc) but i have a feeling it is. Would be more curious if it also exists in some farther Mande languages like Kpelle, Vai, etc.

Also exists in Wolof (Senegal), and in Moore (Mossi, of Burkina Faso), as well as in Lingala (DRC).

Found this about it, claiming it's from Lingala, but I'd like to see some evidence. It also says it's used in Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Chad, and Togo!

I have been working on a piece of software for a couple months that would allow for a certain extent of automatic reasoning and information deduction, based on information and rules that are provided by hand. I have, however, run into some trouble regarding the representation of simple (non-compound and non-complex) English sentences.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_sentence), a simple sentence may be composed of five clause patterns, however, these may contain units such as noun or verb phrases, which are complicated enough for me to recognize that I should not try to learn its mechanics by myself.

What I am looking for in the end, as a mathematician/developer, is to specify a subset of the English statements that is broad enough to allow for flexiblity without needing to account for the weirder parts of the language. If there are multiple correct sentences with different syntax, such as ""she made me a pie"" and ""she made a pie for me"", it is perfectly acceptable to only be able to represent one.

I am looking for help regarding the full ruleset of simple sentences. Do you know of a good resource that summarises every possible way to construct a sentence that is not overly detailed? If it is not too difficult, could someone summarise it for me? I am afraid that I would miss some critical cases and would end up with an incomplete model. I believe that with this information, I would not have much trouble representing compound sentences. I do not see complex sentences as necessary. Am I mistaken? are there cases when information can only be represented using complex sentences, instead of multiple simple or compound sentences?

I used the greek ch ""like chaos"" as a character that blasts into the renaissance to make all kinds of trouble in phoneme/grapheme association. Silent K is the lost German knight.   


I want to show the association of language interactions as different patterns enter the language over time and be able to show it visually. So many of my students, naturally struggle without visuals and concrete examples. Basically,   


In any case, it's funny thinking of how to explain the activities I do with 7 year olds to the linguistic community. I'm looking for this: Videos, maps, activities, etc. that explore different language influences and resulting changes to the English language. In short: Im trying to get my head around how to present some of the interesting historical elements of linguistics to the linguistically challenged.

linguistics,Linguists: What popular science works do you actually recommend?,"This is a question for people with some expertise in linguistics.

All popular science works make some compromises, but some make more compromises than others and some are just too unreliable to recommend. I'm looking for recommendations for popular science works that are actually reliable.

What popular science works would you recommend?

Why do you recommend it?

Do you have any caveats that you think should be included in the recommendation? For example, does it contain outdated information? Does it present a one-sided view of something there is actually considerable disagreement on? Is it a bit more advanced or technical than a complete beginner might want? Etc.

I'll start with one of my own recommendations:

*In the Land of Invented Languages* by Arika Okrent is a fun book for people wanting to learn about why people invent languages and the history of language invention.

**NOTE:** I'm asking this question because I'm looking for recommendations to include in our FAQ. Depending on how this thread goes, I might link to it directly. In order to keep the noise down, please only make recommendations if you have the knowledge to evaluate their reliability.

It would also be nice to avoid one-word responses. Imagine this thread from the perspective of someone looking for recommendations - they would probably like a little more context/explanation.

I have been wondering about some of the factors which may come into play, in general:

* Related languages are more likely to be relatively geographically closer, so in many cases this might be just a result of more extensive contact
* Syntactic similarities may make learning the other language easier and thus bilingualism might be more common
* Similarities in phonetics might be more conducive to borrowing in colloquial speech

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

 * Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

 * Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

 * Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

 * Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

 * English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

 * Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

 * Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

 * Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

 * Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1611579625,AutoModerator,153

linguistics,"What do people talk about? I'm looking for analysis of the content of natural conversations, eg percentage of time communicating useful information about inanimate objects, time communicating about self, time communicating about one's children, time communicating about other people (eg gossip) etc","The different categories of 'what we talk about' could be things like:

Relaying factual information about oneself
Relaying factual information about one's children
Relaying factual information about other people not present (positive/negative/neutral information)
Stories of things that happened that were funny/sad/uplifting/surprising/self-promoting
Talking about what we're worried about
Reassuring the other person
Giving advice
Requesting advice
etc

Clearly some of these categories overlap, so it would be more that conversational content would be tagged with appropriate labels, where it could be tagged with several different labels, like 'factual,self-promoting' - ""Hey, I passed my driving test!"" etc

Would be fascinating to know how the proportions change for different environments/circumstances/situations. For example, how do things change between first meeting someone and getting to know them over time, differences between family members and friends, differences between work colleagues and talking casually with the boss etc

Ideally I'd like to know this in an environment where we're speaking naturally (ie unaware that we're being recorded, since people will shy away from gossiping, for example, if they know they're being recorded).

Obviously there's ethical problems with this, but perhaps some studies were done longer ago when people were less aware of ethics?

Alternatively, are there any such conversations available as raw materials?

linguistics,"Have I earned the ""privilege"" of calling myself a native English speaker?","This is a bit of a stream of consciousness rant, so sorry if it makes for a dense read. That said, I do think the kind of background I've had is becoming increasingly common around the world, and beyond venting my frustrations, I would unironically love to hear your thoughts (the nerdier and more comprehensive the better) on how I ought to be classified.

I was born to Indian parents in a Middle Eastern country. They taught me the language spoken in Kerala, the Indian state they'd migrated out of, and for the first few years of my life, that was the only language I knew. At around 4/4.5 years old-- so well within the critical period-- I was sent to kindergarten, where the language of instruction was English, and exclusively English. I should probably caveat here that the schools I went to were ones operated by and for the Indian immigrant community here in the UAE; so while English was the only language I and my classmates used for communication, the dialect I spoke then could very loosely be described as a polished Indian English.

Anyway, by the time I was 5 or 6, my older sister and I would only ever speak to each other in English. At 7-8 years old, English was my L1: it was the language I spoke at school and at home, and around this time, my father increasingly began to speak to us in English, too. I used to read a lot and consume lots of English-language media online, so by the ages of 9 or 10, I became ""the English guy"" in my class. By the time I was 13 or 14, I was an established ""coconut"" (""brown on the outside, white on the inside"") to some of my classmates and-- \*shudders\* -- your prototypical teenage Grammar Nazi (ftr I'm not a prescriptivist anymore lmao). I also started writing around this time-- poetry and a (worse than forgettable) novel for the NaNoWriMo challenge-- and you can bet my work wasn't in a language I never even learnt to write in. Since then, my writing has come to be a very big part of my identity.

I write better than any native speaker-- not bragging here; everybody has their ""thing"" -- I met in my two years at the American school where I finished my high school education or in the three I spent getting my degree in the UK. I speak English just as well as any of them, too-- for that matter, I speak it with an American accent, although that I only picked up at 16. I think in English, for crying out loud. Given this background, then, have I ""earned"" the privilege to identify, when applying for jobs that state they only accept native English speakers, as being one myself?

Or to rephrase one slightly snarky question as two more sincere ones: Am I a native speaker in your book, r/linguistics? And also-- bc I realize a lot of stuff beyond the ages of 7-8 is superfluous to the question, and bc I know there are many other third culture kids in similar positions to mine-- doesn't it make more sense to stipulate that applicants be *L1* speakers of the language than *native* speakers? I would be interested in learning from your much more informed perspectives, even if they're not necessarily what I want to hear in this moment: even though it's obviously personal circumstances that motivated me to post this right now, this is something I've wondered to myself many times.",1611438975,dorrigo_almazin,23

I have started a personal coding project to play around with applying machine learning (ML) to phonetics. I have neither a background in phonetics nor ML, but I thought this might be a fun project to start getting my feet wet in both fields.

My first foray into this project was to predict the number of syllables in a word based off of its IPA phonetic transcription—a simple enough place to start. Having succeeded in that I now want to predict where the syllable breaks should be. I came across a simple [rule set](http://english.glendale.cc.ca.us/phonics.rules.html) (via this recent [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/asklinguistics/comments/l3bg92/how_does_syllables_work_in_english/gkd14m4/) by u/Cognitively_Absurd) governing a majority of English words that I think should be easy enough for an ML model to learn.

Unfortunately, I’m having a hard time finding lists of phonetic transcriptions that include syllable breaks, which is what you need to train an ML model. I need thousands of words to properly train a model. Do any of you fine people know where I might be able to locate such a list?

linguistics,English word roots?,"Recently, I saw a post in Reddit about what I'd describe below, but cannot recall both the original post and specific examples made about it.

The post was about a phenomenon that some words with the combination of the roots ""A+B"" and ""C"", but unlike their etymology, they have been recognized by people as the combination of ""A"" and ""B+C"", which led other few words derived from them to be ""D"" + ""B+C"".

The reason why I remember this is because I was thinking of similar thing in Korean where 월요일 (meaning Monday), 화요일 (meaning Tuesday), and so on have their origin from 칠요 where there are seven words in total ending with -요 (e.g. 월요, 화요, etc.), and have combined with 일 (meaning days) to translate the seven days of week. Since every word for days end with -요일, people started recognizing the suffix of these words as 요일 when it's actually 일, calling the days of week as 요일.

|Original formation of the words|How it's recognized by people now|
|:-|:-|
|월요 + 일 (Monday)|월 + 요일|
|화요 + 일 (Tuesday)|화 + 요일|

linguistics,New words for non-binary people in Icelandic,"I thought I’d like to share some Icelandic news with you, it’s an interesting insight into how diligent Icelanders are at creating neologisms and trying to get them into circulation. 

For a few years now, Icelandic has had the third-person pronoun *hán*, used by and about some non-binary people instead of *hann* “he” and *hún* “she”. It was created as a blend of the latter two pronouns, as the existing third-person pronoun *það* “it” was thought to be far too dehumanising to describe people.

A driving force in the creation of Icelandic vocabulary to describe LGBT people has been the Samtökin 78 association. I think it was them who pioneered the term *kynsegin* “genderqueer” a few years back, derived from *kyn* “gender” and *hinsegin* “different, unusual.”

Yesterday they announced the creation of four new neologisms to fill in some gaps in the system. Amongst them were *kvár* “adult non-binary person”, a sort of blend of *kona* “woman” and *karl* “man”, and *stálp* “young non-binary person”, inspired by *stelpa* “girl” and *strákur* “boy”. You can read more about it in Icelandic [here](https://samtokin78.is/hyryrdi-2020-nidurstodur/?fbclid=IwAR12mXcQUstKYduHzCrtl-F6BxAg0lbYZx_2jRuejM_UDwfEKdSGUl0L2hY). 

Whether these words will enter common use is another question, but they have had success with *hán* and *kynsegin* in the past. Plus, Icelanders are used to centralised language planning and many common neologisms have entered the language this way through use in the media, etc. A very consensus-based approach to adding 21st-century vocab to a language hundreds of years old.",1611334524,max_naylor,122

So anyway, it turns out the Ancient Greek definite article in the sing. nominative case (which is quite an important one IMO) is ὁ (ho) for masculine and ἡ (hē) for feminine. Could there be any link to Hebrew ""ha-""? I know Hebrew burrowed a lot from Ancient Greek, but mostly after the start of the Hellenistic period, and ""ha-"" seems quite a lot older than that. The timeline doesn't really add-up, but it seems a bit too similar to be a coincidence. Any thoughts?",1611261550,izabo,7

linguistics,Can an idiolect be culturally appropriating after learning the roots and context of the phrase(s)?,"Hello!
I had this question while thinking of my own idiolect (more specifically, my informal use of language including slangs): I’ve grown up in India, which is a multilingual and multicultural country. As a result, I grew up with some slangs from various languages along with English (mentioning this in case this may help in the discussion).
Over the years, my informal language has included slang from these languages I grew up with, along with some online influences e.g. terms like “Booboo the Fool” and “Spill that tea”. I know these terms in particular come from BVE and have been appropriated online. While I did my best to find out the roots of these terms, I still wonder sometimes if it’s culturally appropriating of me to continue using them in my informal idiolect after knowing their roots and contexts (also, to clarify, I use them in the context they were originally placed in and not otherwise).

linguistics,Computational Linguistics and Careers,"Hi fellow linguists!

I'm a current student doing a Master's of Applied Linguistics and am due to likely finish this year. Given my impending completion, I've been scouring the internet for career opportunities, but disconcertingly, have noticed that most open linguistics positions either demand a full PhD with multiple years' experience in a variety of fields, or, more commonly, experience in computational linguistics. Overall, there seems to be a dearth of entry-level general linguistics positions (hell, I wouldn't even know how to gain the experience needed in a lot of the roles).

This has me worried that I've essentially chosen the wrong path and should have instead studied computational linguistics. 
However I have no idea where or how I would learn it, and after many years in higher education already, I'm pretty burnt out, and now I feel as though I've wasted time and effort pursuing a dead end. 

My questions are: if computational linguistics is the be-all and end-all of linguistic application to the job market, is there a way to gain experience in it without having to obtain yet another Bachelor's Degree, and subsequently, devote more time to study (I'd be a mature-age student now)? If not, is there any possible career path for a dejected applied linguist such as myself?

linguistics,Question about stress and enlarging,"Maybe this is a extremely dumb question made dramatical but, Isn't stress enlarging?
I'm a Castilian spanish speaker who's currently learning Japanese and i noticed that in Japanese long vowels tend to have primary stress, f.e: shirīzu [ɕɪ.ˈɾɪː.d͡zu] meaning ""series"". I couldn't help but notice some weird coincidence. 
In Latin the long vowels tend to also have primary stress, f.e: pvēlla/puēlla [ ˈpu̯ɛː.lɑ]. After noticing that i looked to spanish and i realized the opposite. Stressed vowels are enlarged. For example: ""océano"" [ɔ.ˈθɛ.ɑ.nɔ], but if you pay attention to a native speaker saying this word or other words with stressed syllables, you'll notice that they tend to enlarge a bit the stressed vowel. This doesn't happen only in Spanish but in every heavy-stressed language. That lead me to think, isn't stress a form of enlarging? Wouldn't ""océano"" be [ɔθɛˑɑnɔ]? are the long vowels of Latin and Japanese, the same as the stressed syllables of spanish?

Note: I speak Egyptian Arabic which has such a cluster in words like btāʕ \['pta:ʕ\] ""thing"" and ktīr ""a lot"" where unstressed high vowels are usually deleted, this is the case in every-day or fast speech. Egyptian Arabic becomes vowelish in formal speech and singing and as a native speaker because it sounds calmer? that way while the syncopated speech makes you sound like you are at work or in rush but it's very common and I speak that way most of the time.

linguistics,"What/when is the origin of English noun-verb heterophones, and what/when is the etymological and heterophonic relationship between ""use"" and ""refuse""?","I recently learned about the concept of heterophones, and it got me interested in the history of the word *use* and its relationship with *refuse* as well as words directly derived from *use* (*reuse*, *misuse*, etc.). I have two slightly separate sets of questions:

In general, many English words are heterophonic due to differing pronunciation between the noun and verb forms, e.g., *use* /ju:s/ and *use* /ju:z/.

* Is there a word for this phenomenon?
* Is there a rule for when this occurs? Are there any noun-verb homophones? If there is a rule, did it develop because noun-verb heterophones kept developing, or did words in this category come to be due to the rule?
* How did this develop? Were words in this category heterophonic from the same moment they were used as both nouns and verbs, was this a simultaneous shift in language where many words underwent this change at once, or did many different words happen to receive this treatment separately?


More specifically, *use* has many derived words (*reuse*, *misuse*, etc.) constructed by adding a prefix. I was told in the weekly Q&amp;A that *refuse* did not come to be in this way. 
* Did *use* become heterophonic before or after the introduction of words derived from it, like *reuse* or *misuse*? Is the heterophonic distinction for the derived words determined by their own structure, or by the heterophonic distinction for *use*?
* Etymologically, is *refuse* **completely unrelated** to *use*, or is the relationship just different? (E.g., neither is derived from the other, but they share a genetic origin.) When was each word introduced in English?
* Regardless of the answer to the previous question, assuming there are rules to how noun-verb heterophones come to be, is it the *-use* part of *refuse* that determines its different pronunciations, or no? If the answer is yes, or if *refuse* were derived from *use*, I would expect the noun form to be pronounced ""ree-FYOOS""/""ruh-FYOOS"" rather than ""REF-yoos"".",1611018515,thunderbeard317,0

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

 * Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

 * Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

 * Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

 * Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

 * English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

 * Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

 * Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

 * Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

 * Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1610974820,AutoModerator,213
linguistics,Using two forms of the same language,"I'm wondering how many of you out there are using the same language but in two fairly different forms. In my case I have the option, entirely consciously, to swap between Spanish of Spain and Spanish of Mexico (Oaxaca region). My first language is English but I learned the former many, many years ago and lived and worked in Spain. I met my Mexican girlfriend some 12 years ago who in turn had lived many years in Spain and had the ability to switch between the two forms, Mexican and Spanish. Later, when we went to live in Mexico I took the plunge and swapped out my accent, pronunciation,  grammar and vocabulary for the local version. (No one should ever underestimate the difference of vocabulary between the two countries - basically a large percentage of the most common words are different in the two countries.)

Interestingly, the two of us returned to live in Spain last year and within very few weeks went back to speaking Spanish of Spain - well at least with the local Spanish residents. Between ourselves we have the choice which to speak at any given moment and will endless play with the two language forms. Even when speaking Spanish of Spain we'll throw in certain Mexican words which are simply too useful to avoid e.g. checar - to check instead of the uncomfortable Spanish comprobar or revisar and Mexican swear words are almost compulsory!

I would love to hear of other examples of this from other members and to what degree the two forms vary and in what circumstances you swap.",1610970412,jibroc,6

linguistics,Does the internet speed up or slow down the evolution of languages?,"Now, the reason i ask is that, at first glance, languages would evolve faster through the internet. This is especially true for english, as there are a lot of english speakers in the world and english is the lingua franca on the internet. Therefore, the internet allows a lot of english speakers whose speech was up until recently mostly isolated to now intercommunicate, and the more people speak a language, the quicker it tends to change.  


However, since the internet also documents how we speak now, the interesting question is how much this ""archival"" function will affect the evolution of languages. Sure, we have been documenting language more than ever in the last 100 years, especially with the advent of things like television. However, as the internet becomes more and more universal due to its easy accessibility, this effect will become even stronger than anything before. What im curious about is if this documentation of our current language will go on to be perceived as the ""correct way"" of speaking, thus slowing the evolution, or if the sheer mass of english speakers intercommunicating will overcompensate for it, thus speeding the evolution up. (The same can be said for other languages too of course, english is just a more extreme example due to how universal it is as well as the sheer mass of people who speak it)",1610963516,chrischi3,47

linguistics,Is there a modern English cognate of Latin “Caecus”?,"Proto-Indo-European had the word “Kaykos”, which survived into Latin as “Caecus”, meaning blind. (“Ciego” in modern Spanish of the same meaning is descended from this, I believe). 

In Proto-Germanic, we’d expect this to be “Haihaz”. And there is a word, “Haihs”, that’s used in the Gothic translation of the Bible, use to mean one-eyed (so an alike meaning to “blind”), which shows that “Haihaz” was almost certainly a real word, which was cognate with “Caecus”. 

In modern English, since the “az” drops off, and “ai” shifts to “o”, you’d expect this to be something like “hoe” or “ho” (maybe the last “h” having shifted to “gh”, and it being something like “hogh” in Middle English, and that surviving in spelling to now, or maybe even in pronunciation in certain dialects).

linguistics,Cosmos etymology,"cosmos (n.)
c. 1200, ""the universe, the world"" (but not popular until 1848, when it was taken as the English equivalent to Humboldt's Kosmos in translations from German), from Latinized form of Greek kosmos ""order, good order, orderly arrangement,"" a word with several main senses rooted in those notions: The verb kosmein meant generally ""to dispose, prepare,"" but especially ""to order and arrange (troops for battle), to set (an army) in array;"" also ""to establish (a government or regime);"" ""to deck, adorn, equip, dress"" (especially of women). Thus kosmos had an important secondary sense of ""ornaments of a woman's dress, decoration"" (compare kosmokomes ""dressing the hair,"" and cosmetic) as well as ""the universe, the world.""

Pythagoras is said to have been the first to apply this word to ""the universe,"" perhaps originally meaning ""the starry firmament,"" but it later was extended to the whole physical world, including the earth. For specific reference to ""the world of people,"" the classical phrase was he oikoumene (ge) ""the inhabited (earth)."" Septuagint uses both kosmos and oikoumene. Kosmos also was used in Christian religious writing with a sense of ""worldly life, this world (as opposed to the afterlife),"" but the more frequent word for this was aiōn, literally ""lifetime, age.""

From earlier *ḱónsmos, from Proto-Indo-European *ḱens- or *ḱems- (“to put in order”). Related to Latin cēnseō (“to estimate”) and Sanskrit शंसति (śaṃsati, “to commend, praise”).[1]

Космос - КосМост - Kos Most –  [Bent Bridge in Macedonian](https://www.crystalinks.com/nnutarch450.jpg).

linguistics,Words accidentally resembling proto-language forms,"English is phonetically not a very conservative Indo-European language, especially in regards to vowels. For example, the PIE word *h₂ékʷeh₂, roughly /ħé.kʷeħ/ has an English descendant ea /iː/. So it's rather odd that the English word ""water"" resembles a reconstructed ancestor, PIE *wódr̥, very nearly in pronunciation: /ˈwɔtr̩/ (Eng) vs /wódr̩/ (PIE)

This is actually a coincidence for the most part. The English word has, in fact, undergone a series of drastic shifts (though not really to its consonants, since English is relatively conservative with regards to consonants). The previous paragraph is a little misleading, since the English form is actually from a collective form of the same PIE word, *wédōr; in any case, it has undergone roughly the following stages (taken from Wiktionary): 

/wé.doːr/ (PIE) &gt; /ˈwɑ.tɔːr/ (PGem) &gt; /ˈwæ.ter/ (OEng) &gt; /ˈwatəː()r/ (MEng) &gt; /ˈwɔtəɹ/ (NEng) ( &gt; [ˈwɔɾɚ] GenAm, [woːʔɐ] EstEng)

linguistics,On the utility of reading grammars,"While I was in school, just reading through grammars was not A Thing. Like, I did occasionally have to reference grammars, and a couple of times I checked one out of the library and just read through to learn everything I could in a weekend about an interesting language, but never for a class did I just have to read a grammar.

But for about the last ten months, to counteract lockdown-induced social isolation, I have been participating in a weekly videocall discussion group in which we just read grammar, and then talk about them. And oh my goodness, why have I not been doing this for my *entire education and subsequent career!?*

So far, we have gone through Inuktitut, Tlingit, Yale, Sahidic Coptic, and Sandawe, with each member of the group taking turns to pick the next language we study when we finish one. (For Yale, an indigenous language of Papua New Guinea, we read *and critiqued* the as-yet-unpublished first ever grammar of the language, as the author is also a member of the group.) Each one takes about 8 weeks to get through, and we've discovered that it is possible to fill an hour with discussion of just about any arbitrarily small section of whatever we happen to be reading at the time! And so far, every single language we have studied has introduced me to something new--sometimes something that makes sense, but I just hadn't ever known of a language actually doing before, sometimes something that makes you go ""who ordered that?"" or ""what in the world is going on here!?""

If getting use to this kind of broad, undirected reading has been part of my formal education, I feel like I would be a much more well-rounded linguist today. So, if you can put together a discussion group, I highly recommend it. And if you can't... well, maybe just ask someone to recommend a grammar to you, something you wouldn't pick for yourself, and go read it!",1610828739,gliese1337,53

Do you know any study discussing this phenomena typologically? The only paper marginally related to this that I have found is Müller, André &amp; Weymuth, Rachel.

Currently, I'm a native English speaker, I learned French in school, and on leaving school was fairly fluent to the point I could follow conversations and speak without hesitation, however I have now graduated from university and haven't used French at all in that time, unfortunately letting it fall away.

In university, I studied Mandarin Chinese, though I am now at a much higher level with this than my French ever was, as I lived in China for a year as part of my degree. My job is actually in translation from Mandarin to English for a big tech company, so I still use it everyday, despite having returned home.

I'm now considering doing a Master's degree in Applied Linguistics &amp; Intercultural Relations, for which I don't *need* any more languages, but as I'm interested in linguistics and language learning overall I'd like to pick up a new one before starting. 

My question is; Do I learn a new language - I was considering Norwegian, as I'd like to spend some time there if I can convince my girlfriend to come too, OR do I go back to French and try to bring that back to or even passed the level I had attained previously? 

There's also a level of guilt involved, as I'm from Ireland, but cannot speak Irish. We're taught it in school, but for whatever reason, we all leave after 14 years of being taught it and 90% have almost no grasp of it, and as soon as I started learning French in secondary (US equivalent of High) school, I lost interest in it entirely, and so a part of me feels guilty for learning all these foreign languages while abandoning my native one.

I've noticed in almost every play there is the occasional rolling of the R, and it seems almost sporadic. And the older the recordings I fine it seems the more common it is. I'm sorry I cannot find a specific example, as I'd have to skim an entire play to find one, but in some recordings of Macbeth, when a character is speaking with conviction and fast, occasionally they will roll their R's to but specific importance on something.

This thing of actors, occasionally rolling their Rs seems to be a part of culture, to make things sound more dramatic some (usually older, maybe their 30s) British people will roll 1 word in a sentence, one of my favorite youtubers, Nerdcubed does and did this often...

|         | Singular | Dual       | Plural     |
|---------|----------|------------|------------|
| **1st** | *mannon* | *mannu*    | *mannot*   |
| **2nd** | *mana*   | *mannu*    | *mannet*   |
| **3rd** | *mannos* | *mannoska* | *mannoset* |

Compare with the Finnish cognate *mennä* 'to go':

|         | Singular  | Plural      |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **1st** | N/A       | *menkäämme* |
| **2nd** | *mene*    | *menkää*    |

linguistics,"How do Linguists address we's more detailed than the exclusive/inclusive we's, and is there any natural language actually is more specific than them?","So, I was thinking about glosses, and I realized a potential limitation in how they are presented. There's representation for languages with the *inclusive* and *exclusive we*, to a certain extent, but to what extent, I'm not entirely sure. By rights, shouldn't there be multiple inclusive and exclusive we's depending on number?

For example, all of the following could be inclusive:

* Myself and the addressee
* Myself and the multiple addressees
* Myself, the addressee, and someone else
* Myself, the addressee, and multiple others
* Myself, the addressees, and someone else
* Myself, the addressees, and multiple others

Then you would have two exclusive we's:

* Myself and someone else
* Myself and multiple others

Now, technically, I could use this same sort of argument to say that we don't have a category for something needlessly complicated (which I could do by including gender or numbers beyond singular and plural): *Myself (male), the addressees (dual number; both male), and one other person (female)*. Having said that, the previously mentioned eight possibilities for exclusive and inclusive we might very well be specified in some language, no?

I mean, it doesn't seem particularly far fetched for a language to have multiple pronouns that form new ones, so you wouldn't need a ton of pronouns to address the combinations:

For example, here's a hypothetical language with a few pronouns established:  
**Yan** = I  
**Iban** = You (singular)  
**Abok** = You (plural)  
**Elek** = They (singular)  
**Etuk** = They (plural)  
I could create a word **Yanibanetuk** to mean *myself, the addressee, and multiple others*.

Again, this all hypothetical, but given the simplicity of it, I wouldn't be surprised if something it appeared in a natural language.

I'm curious to know whether this sort of clusivity issue has ever come up in linguistics before, or if there are any languages that are more specific than a simple exclusive–inclusive dichotomy could indicate.",1610688331,NoPreference6356,10

The concept of heterophones/heteronyms just recently came to my attention, and after a discussion tonight about pronunciation of ""have"" vs. ""have to"", I ended up on the heteronym Wikipedia page which lists a bunch of them. My questions are:

* Is ""have"" a heterophone? It's not on the list on the Wikipedia page. If it isn't, why isn't it?
* It seems to me that the heterophones of ""refuse"" are semantically related to each other, and same with those of ""use"", but the ""refuse"" family is not semantically or etymologically related to the ""use"" family. Yet, both seem to have the same variation of pronunciation. That's interesting to me!

On his website he wrote about the phonological processes that caused the IIr languages in general to evolve in the way they did which I think I get it but not at the same time, but if his theory is true it would be awesome because it would explain the whole phonological evolution of IIr languages as a result of a *weird kind of assimilation*. You can see this page as he explains it here: [https://nuristan.info/Nuristani/BasicEvolutionaryProcesses.html](https://nuristan.info/Nuristani/BasicEvolutionaryProcesses.html)

&amp;#x200B;

Basically this front/back tensing, *pushing the larynx forward or backward during phonation*, causes a low pitch with some breathy and backing of the tongue in case of back tensing, and fronting of the tongue and a high pitch in case of front tensing. He associates this with early speakers wanting to sound *nice* or *harsh* but then it caused phonological effects like IIr palatalization, favoring breathy voicedness and retroflexes in indo-aryan languages and nearby iranian ones, ...etc. It's awesome and almost like a *theory of everything* for IIr languages.

&amp;#x200B;

but my problem is that I want to find more on these phonological processes outside of strand's IIr studies, and the difference between posterior/anterior voicing and high/low pitch and breathy-voicedness, and this front/back tensing I want to see if there are any other languages analyzed by it and more information about it in general.",1610660419,Bitchfester104,0

linguistics,Voiced pharyngealized consonants in Arabic,"It is usually agreed upon that Proto-Semitic had some sort of voiceless glottalized consoants for emphatics which came to be realized as ejectives in some branches, e.g. Ethiopic Semitic, and as pharyngealized (or uvularized) in Arabic, Aramaic etc.  How did Arabic get voiced pharyngealized consonants though, e.g. /zˤ\~ðˤ dˤ/?

Earlier Semitic emphatics seem to be have been realized as ejectives as they were solely restricted to voiceless phonemes, e.g. Akkadian &lt;ṭ ṣ q&gt; being /tʼ sʼ\~t͡sʼ kʼ/, and we know that there were a few more voiceless ones in Proto-Semitic that fused with others in some branches, e.g. &lt;t̠̣ ṣ́&gt;, possibly fricatives /θʼ ɬʼ/ or affricates /t͡θʼ t͡ɬʼ/. Current emphatics in Aramaic are pharyngealized but they're restricted to voiceless phonemes as well, namely /tˤ sˤ/.

So how did Arabic get its voiced phargynealized consonants? Do /tˤ dˤ/ come from PS &lt;ṭ&gt;?  How did we get from ejectives to \[ɮˤ\~dɮˤ\] in Classical Arabic?

In the last few years I have developed an interest in languages and linguistics but never considered it something I would study mostly because I was in the process of (now months away from) completing my BSc in physics but also because I didn't think a regular BA in linguistics made me very employable. However, I recently found out that computational linguistics is a field, and that my linear algebra, statistics, and multivariable calculus skills could be transferable. I also have experience with python and understand computer science at a first-to-second year level and I intend to pursue a master's degree in physics where I might use machine learning. 

If I were to do my masters in physics using machine learning, how likely do you think it would be that a computational linguistics program would accept me for a PhD? What are the necessary prerequisites for such a degree? (from what I've seen usually a linguistics degree is required but some programs accept students with other backgrounds).

I'm not sure if this has any bearing but I am Canadian and would likely study at a Canadian school and I am doing well academically but am not extraordinary.

It's almost completely non-existent today, and descriptions of 'Estuary English' seem highly regional and don't really describe the modern southern standard either.

linguistics,What insights from other languages have helped you better understand English (or your native language)?,"So for example, as I’ve taken French and German I’ve learned to notice certain kind of *loose rules* which have helped me connect related words to their roots in Latin or elsewhere. This ultimately helped me better understand English despite it being my native language, often by teaching me new words. For instance, I can remember fenêtre because of the lost-s circumflex thing whereby it 
makes it obvious that this word is related to “fenestration”, which I admittedly learned after learning the French correlate. 

I’m less able to articulate the equivalents of this in German — but there are many German words I can either hear or see and through this see their connection to English equivalents or relatives. So what I’m wondering is if there are specific things like this you all have learned which have helped you to better connect languages with common origins which you’re learning?

Sorry if this is scattered, I’m a bit removed from linguistics at this point but my love for it is still there and I’m always looking for new ways to make connections. For instance, I also recently realized Spanish and Arabic have a great deal of overlap due to the historical cultural intermingling, which reinvigorated my desire to learn more Spanish and Arabic since I could infer some Spanish already from what I’ve learned of French.",1610491568,Oivasac,10

linguistics,Looking for clarification re: how the Celtic languages are classified,"My apologies in advance for this long post. I have some questions about how the Celtic languages are classified. I am aware of the Insular vs. Celtic and P vs. Q categories. However, it is not clear to me exactly what the boundaries are for these classifications and whether, in the case of Insular vs. Continental, this is a strictly geographic classification or if it has a temporal and/or genetic aspect. With P vs. Q, it's not apparent to me that this should be subsumed within Insular Celtic.

I am aware that the Celtic languages of the European landmass — Celtiberian, Lepontic, Galatian, Gaulish — are called Continental. The languages of Britain, Ireland and Brittany are called Insular and are subdivided into Q-Celtic (the Goidelic languages) and P-Celtic (the Brythonic ones). However, from what I've read, the Continental Celtic languages can also be distinguished based on whether they developed a /ku̯/ or /p/ sound, thus I am wondering if this Q vs. P distinction is not limited to just describing the Insular languages but applies to all Celtic languages. 

If Continental and Insular are mutually exclusive categories and are based on genetic relationships, then I assume this means that the Insular and Continental languages shared a common ancestor and then they diverged. Then these two groups further diversified. But from what I've read, the distinguishing mark of (Insular) Q-Celtic, the sound /ku̯/, is also found in (Continental) Celtiberian, and the /p/ of (Insular) P-Celtic is found in (Continental) Gaulish and Lepontic. If that's the case, and assuming these two sounds didn't evolve independently after some split between Continental and Insular, then I don't see how we can neatly divide the Celtic languages into Continental and Insular on a linguistic basis. Furthermore, if we are going to set Q- and P-Celtic in opposition to each other, then P vs. Q shouldn't be a subdivision within Insular, which is how I've seen it explained (e.g. Cunliffe ""The Ancient Celts"" p. 32), but rather a division that runs throughout the whole Celtic family. 

It does not seem, then, that at some point in time the Continental and Insular Languages split up, and then later within the Insular group a further split between Q and P languages occurred. It seems that the relation between Q and P has nothing to do with the Insular va. Continental distinction and happened very long ago. Is that correct?

Another linguistic distinction I've read about has to do with syllabic nasals. I don't know much about this other than that it seems that Celtiberian is more similar to Brythonic and Gaulish than it is to Goidelic (unlike the /ku̯/ vs /p/ distinction where Goidelic and Celtiberian share the /ku̯/ feature). Again, what I'm seeing here are linguistic criteria that don't seem to follow any sort of discernable distinction between languages of the Continent and languages of the British Isles. Instead, the linguistic features seem to cut through the Celtic family in a direction that has nothing to do with what side of the English Channel a given language falls on.

Is Continental vs Insular, then, nothing more than a convenient way to distinguish the living (Insular) and the extinct (Continental) languages? That is, that it has no scientific linguistic basis, rather just a convenient historical one? Basically where Insular just means a direct ancestor of the living (or recently deceased) Celtic languages (which*happened* to be spoken in Britain and Ireland) and Continental means languages that died very long ago (and *happened* to be spoken on the Continent)? If so, how are the Insular languages related to the Continental ones temporally and genetically? Or do we simply not have enough data to draw up a rigorously supported timeline and tree showing how the Celtic languages developed from proto-Celtic into Gaulish, Celtiberian, Lepontic, and the predecessors of Goidelic and Brythonic?

Sorry again for the long-winded post. If anyone can untangle the above mess and just break down the Celtic family for me, I'd appreciate it!",1610483099,GodEmperorBiden,5

linguistics,"""he and I"" vs. ""he and him"" in the nominative case in English","I'm not a formal or trained linguist. I'm a translator and the only linguistics I have ever really learned has been the grammar required to learn a second language as an adult. So I approach this without the same kind of theoretical knowledge as a lot of you will have.

Here's a hill I am willing to die on: ""he and I"" sounds incorrect. Like a hypercorrection that jars for me every bit as much as the old Cockney thing of calling the fruits 🍎🍏 ""happles"" etc. While I understand the reasoning (carrying forward singular 1st person pronoun into a.. I'm not sure what to call ""he and I"", a compound first person plural pronoun?), it sounds to me instinctively as incorrect as ""an tiger"".

I feel like the rule can be described pretty easily: the 1st person singular nominative case pronoun in English is ""I""; but as part of the nominative compound first person plural pronoun as I've speculatively named it, it becomes ""me""; ""me and my dad went to the supermarket"", ""my friends and me went on holiday to Spain"". I feel this is a fair description of a standardised, regularised usage.

I've found a few discussions of similar issues online, but am interested in seeing what this subreddit thinks, if this usage has been otherwise described/categorised, what kind of resistance to that grammatical description there might be amongst prescriptive linguists, etc.",1610464225,themeadows94,4

Some might say that the countries with shorter names might have them because they have had interaction with the Chinese at an earlier time period and the names just stuck, but why didn't they just follow the 2 character pattern in naming the rest later on when they can clearly see a common structure? Meanwhile, some might argue that syllabication was done because maybe it's simpler to do since there might be confusions between countries if they were restricted to 2 character names, but the Chinese managed to name every element in the periodic table, which is more numerous than the number of countries, with a single character with no problem, so why couldn't they name countries with only 2 characters?",1610454712,MangerDuCamembert,12

But are there cultures / communities where place names and proper names don't carry this additional meaning? For example, in culture X the name ""Blarb"" is just a name with no additional meaning; it only exists to label someone as ""Blarb"". Similarly, ""Giuaethy"" is the name for a town, but ""Giuaethy"" is just a label with no additional significance.

Any question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate discussion all of the time, here are some examples: 

*Quick questions:*

* Asking for an explanation of a technical term
* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature
* Asking how we would transcribe something
* Asking how a feature works in a particular language

*Not-so-quick questions:*

* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

Also, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search.

linguistics,Any study on discourse particles in Jakartan Indonesian?,"So, discourse particles are a very common feature in Southeast/East Asian languages. I've encountered studies being done on Singlish discourse particled for example. However, there seems to be nothing on my own native language (Jakartan Indonesian). Neither, I suppose, on KL Malay, for example.

Each of these languages have different discourse particles carrying different meanings, and are a very huge part of casual communication. Non-native speakers encounter huge difficulty in picking these up, and yes they are linguistically meaningful to denote intent and information regarding the speaker's perception of the listener. The latter usage especially, is a big, BIG part of highly context dependent languages. I believe they deserve more attention in linguistics perhaps as a category of its own.

Just to list a few particles...

Kan, sih(1) sih(2), deh, dong, nah, tuh, lah (1), lah(2), mah, noh, lho, kok, weh, woi, ya, etc.

For children over the age of 10, daily attendance at schools is not compulsory.

Students should complete a minimum number of study hour per year, however, they may make up these hours by studying at home at times that suit their family schedule.
They can log on early or late in the day and even join live classes in other countries. In order to ensure that
each student is learning adequately, computer solfware will automatically monitor the number hours a week each student studies online as well as that student's learning materials and assessment activities. Reports will be available for parents and teachers. The solfware can then identify the best learning activities and conditions for each individual student and generate similar activities. It can be also identify areas of weak achi and produce special programs adjusted to the student's needs.

The question is: 
How many times are children who are older than ten required to go to school weekly?

A. Once or twice

B. No time

The answer is A and it's the national answer. This is confusing me a lot since I see no evidence indicating the ""required"" thing given in the passage. I'm not sure whether I'm understanding the passage the wrong way or not but in my opinion, the passage is saying that ""pupils don't need to go school, they only have a minimum number of study hour that they must complete every year and these hours can be made up by studying at home at times that suits their family schedule, which means they have no requirement on those ""weekly attendances"".

I would absolutely analyse these as being phonemic length distinctions, with /ɪ/, /ɪː/, /ɛ/ and /ɛː/ being phonemically separate. 

Another example I can think of for me is /ɑ/ and /ɑː/. An example of a minimal pair for this would be 'stutter' and 'starter.' 

It might be possible to analyse the long vowels as being the realisation of a short vowel followed by a rhotic, but I see no reason to analyse them this way other than that there's still an 'r' there in spelling (which I've always been taught is not relevant to phonology). I could be wrong about what the best interpretation of this is, though, so I'm totally open to correction. 

But what about other vowels that are pronounced with the same length as the vowels in 'pierce' and 'bared', but aren't contrasted with short vowels? Is it appropriate to analyse /iː/ as phonemically long because it's usually pronounced longer than what have historically been short vowels? I should point out that the 'allophonic lengthening before voiced consonants' rule present in a lot of American dialects is not present in mine (to the best of my analysis), and length does just seem to be a feature of /iː/ in most environments I can think of. If the dialect has been analysed as having a phonemic length contrast for other vowel qualities, does that affect whether it's appropriate to put a length marker here? 

N.b. I know the values I describe here aren't the traditional ones given for RP, but those are about 50 years out of date and don't really represent how most people in the southeast speak anymore. I'm fairly confident that I've assigned the right IPA characters to these in my accent.",1610079097,Skipquernstone,10

Or did God say ... you've got the idea.

Obviously I'm simplifying the reality given that not all nouns and verbs are created from the others. It is very likely that both types of words existed in the cradle of human languages. Yet I cannot help thinking which part of speech was more natural in a primitive state of nature.

For example, when a honeybee waggles in communicating to his brother, is he saying ""go this way to collect""? Or is it ""Sun, Same Direction, Flowers""?

I tend to think that actions are more fundamental than objects. It seems to me that objects that do not evoke actions have no informational value to animals and therefore that the signified in primitive languages must be a verb phrase whether or not it contains what we call nouns.

linguistics,Taiwanese Southern Min Orthographical Standardization,"This is probably quite niche, so not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask.

What’s going on with attempts to standardizing a writing system for Taiwanese Southern Min (台灣閩南語; TSM), which is also called “Taiwanese” (台語 Taiyu/Tâi-gí/Tâi-gú)? There’s lots of competing writing systems, including using Chinese characters only, Roman letters only (e.g. Pe̍h-ōe-jī), a mix of those 2, Taiwanese Kana and using a Taiwanese Hangul. What’s with this lack of a standard system? I get that it was heavily suppressed during Martial Law. It’s difficult to find literature on this, but its seems to not really be going anywhere.

How serious is this ‘incompatibility’ of Chinese Characters to TSM? I assume the problem TSM has with Chinese Characters is analogous to Japan and Korea’s situation historically? E.g. Man'yōgana using Chinese Characters to phonetically represent a word like Sushi 壽司 which semantically is unrelated to ‘longevity’ or ‘administration’. Apparently there are words in TSM which don’t have a cosponsoring character (有音無字 – there is sound, but not character), so don’t know if there have been attempts to essentially create Chinese characters; which I know Japan has done (e.g. 働). Probably some Japanese loanwords got mixed in from Japanese colonization too.

Basically, is writing in TSM actually a thing at this point? When you have a bunch of variations of writing systems and not one of them officially backed by the government, things seem rather abysmal, no?

linguistics,Theoretical frameworks for understanding metaphor processing/comprehension?,"I am trying to analyze how people interpret and understand metaphors, for example, consider the Yeats line:

We saw the last embers of daylight die,

If we show this sentence to someone by revealing one word at a time, they might interpret “embers” literally, then, when they see “daylight”, might switch to interpreting “embers” as a metaphor for that the daylight receded and faded in a red-hued sunset.

I am trying to understand more precise mechanisms by which this happens.

I.e, is there any current cognitive-neural theory of what actually happens in the mind-brain when someone contemplates a word, like “embers”? Do we know anything at all like, “the word is probably stored in region X of the brain; when the word is activated or triggered, there are neural channels, memory links connecting it to regions X Y and Z of the brain which provide sensory information, ie, an image of embers we have gained from personal experiences over time, round hot red-white pieces of flaming, glowing wood; plus somehow a semantic network of propositional knowledge is activated, however and wherever it is stored, ie, we know what embers are factually, they are what happens when a log burns down a bit and so on.” And adding to that, when the brain processes and contemplates “embers of daylight die”, it does a similar computational process, ie, both the sensory imprints or images of embers and daylight might be activated and fused in some way (ie a picture of deep red sunset), and propositional knowledge like, “embers of daylight die” just means the red hue of the sunset faded.

I.e., do we know anything about what’s going on in the mind-brain, the specific operations and brain regions responsible for processing a sentence, particularly a metaphor, like this? What field or framework is that? (Obviously “neurolinguistics” but maybe a specific book or paper where people do exactly this kind of analysis?)

I don't think I can conduct research or constantly publish/write. sorry if that's a bit shallow of me but even if I did do these things as a student I'm not much interested in that side of the situation, constantly producing. but also I'm not sure if there is any other way of working in this field. as in so-to-speak the laboratory/kitchen of the field. assisting the experiments, working in the data collecting or being any other tool that is needed within this field. 
I'm not even sure if the things I have suggested have any counterparts but I only used them to explain what I want to be doing. 
basically I am more interested in the ""errands"" if there are any than the intellectual productive part (?) 
is there any such title that I can pursue?  what should I study in masters to be useful in the background work?

so sorry for my ignorance 🙏🙏",1609852080,halee_,5

linguistics,Scottish and Manx Gaelic verb conjugation,"From what I’ve read, Scottish and Manx Gaelic seem both to have rather simple verb conjugations as opposed to most Irish Gaelic dialects which have multiple tenses each encoded with the verb.

linguistics,"Etymology of the Maltese, Mediterranean Compass (Cardinal Directions)","I was looking up the cardinal directions in Maltese and thought some members would find the following information interesting. (If you don't already know, Maltese is a Semitic language with a Roman alphabet.)

The word for compass in Maltese is ""Warda tal-Irjieħ"" which directly translates to ""rose of the wind"".

https://imgur.com/a/CZOF2WU The big, cursive words in red (Ix-Xmiel, Ix-Xarq, Il-Qibla, L-Għarb) are old Maltese words deriving from Arabic that are rarely used. We use the Romantic alternatives underneath them however ""Riħ Fuq"" (high wind) and ""Riħ Isfel"" (low wind) are still used sometimes.
I do not know the origins of the other words but ""Qibla"" is the direction towards the Kaaba (where Muslims pray). It is South because before due South was used for prayer instead of the direction towards Mecca. [From Wikipedia: ""Some early Muslims used due south everywhere as the qibla, literally following Muhammad's instruction to face south while he was in Medina (Mecca is due south of Medina)"".] 
I also suspect it links to the word ""talba"" in Maltese which means prayer but I am not sure. 

The other words have more Romantic origins and are similar to their Italian counterparts. (Note that the Italian words derived from Maltese not the other way around 😜). They are also similar to French, Spanish and Greek in origin.

""Tramuntana"" (North) is derived from the Latin phrase meaning 'across mountains' because the Alps are North of Malta.

""Grigal"" (Northeast) — 'Grieg/Griega' is the adjective used for something Greek in Maltese. Greece is Northeast of Malta.

""Lvant"" (East) — The Levant region is East of Malta. 

""Xlokk"" (Southeast) — This wind comes from the Sahara and often carries sand with it across the Mediterranean. It comes from the Arabic word sharqiyya (شرقية) meaning East. (Can someone that speaks Arabic confirm this pls).

""Nofsinhar"" (South) — Nofsinhar means noon in Maltese. At noon the sun is directly South. 

""Lbiċ"" (Southwest) — comes from the Latin word meaning 'Libyan'. Libya is Southwest of Malta.  

""Punent"" (West) is derived from the Latin word meaning 'to set' because the Sun sets in the West of Malta.

""Majjistral"" (Northwest) — this wind is a strong, cold, often dreaded wind that blows from Southern France, fills the Gulf of Lion and makes its way to the Mediterranean. The word comes from 'maestro/master' because sailors consider it the principal wind — the 'master' of navigation in the Mediterranean.

I am new around here, so sorry if this doesn’t belong. My native language is a Slavic language, but I grew up in an English-speaking country. I noticed that it is really awkward to say “I love you” in everyday, casual conversations when speaking in my native (Slavic) language. For example, when saying goodbye to someone in person or on the phone,  when I speak English or Spanish, I can end the conversation by saying “I love you” or “te quiero mucho” with all of my family members and close friends. However, in my native language I would never say these things. I always have to say “I love you” or “Love you” in English, even if the entire conversation was in my native Slavic language. 

Anyway, this is just something that I’ve noticed, and I guess I am just looking for an interesting discussion regarding these linguistic cultural differences. I’d be curious to hear if anyone has had similar experiences regarding the use of “I love you” in casual, everyday communication.

linguistics,Language acquisition by virtual agent (The Folks’Talks game project),"**Abstract.**

The project aims to simulate language acquisition. We simulate language acquisition by a virtual agent from a native speaker. The demonstrated principles for acquisition are suitable for any language. These are the initial principles of the Folks’Talks game project:

1. Acquisition starts from scratch. There is no preliminary data.

2. The collected data is vocal (wave files) and not connected to any writing system.

3. In the virtual interaction areas of the Folks’Talks game objects are placed in specific ways, within specific scenes, and with specific relations. These objects represent the inner world of the Folks’Talks game, which is a small reflection of the real world with its three main components: space, time, and society.

4. This inner world must be described vocally by a human speaker in phrases with definite patterns. 

5. These phrases are marked by the speaker. The markers are: 

a. Phrase pattern

b. Object within the phrase

c. Phrase intonation (question, imperative, statement, etc.)

d. Number of words in the phrase

e. Function of each word in the phrase

f. Some others markers.

Initially, the speaker records and marks an acceptable amount of all variations of the phrase patterns (about 5 repetitions for each tested phrase). We then extract sound features from all recordings. We extract 53 features for each recording frame using the Essentia library. For training and subsequent recognition, we use the TensorFlow C-API. The trained virtual agent can:

1. Name an object the human speaker points at

2. Find a requested object

3. Give a suitable answer for a trained question-answer pair

4. Give an answer about an object’s size and color

5. Execute requested vocal commands

6. Recognize different speaking intonations (command, question, story, etc.)",1609773032,FolksTalksGame,0

          Any question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate discussion all of the time, here are some examples: 

          *Quick questions:*

          * Asking for an explanation of a technical term
          * Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature
          * Asking how we would transcribe something
          * Asking how a feature works in a particular language

          *Not-so-quick questions:*

          * Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
          * Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

          If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

linguistics,Scopal readings of multiple quantifiers,"It is well known that any sentence with two or more quantifiers will result in in multiple possible readings depending on the ordering of the quantifiers. To take a known example (1), there will be two readings: In (1.a) the universal takes wide scope while in (1.b) the existential takes wide scope and the universal takes narrow scope.

&amp;#x200B;

(1) Everybody loves someone.

(1.a) ∀ &gt; ∃ \[For every person, there is a potentially different person they love.\]

(1.b) ∃ &gt; ∀ \[There is a specific person and everyone loves that specific person.\]

&amp;#x200B;

(1.a) is what is known as a surface scope, i.e., the logical form matches up with the phonological form while (1.b) is known as an inverted scope reading i.e., the logical form is the invert of the phonological form. Most of the times, the surface scope entails the inverse scope but not vice versa:

&amp;#x200B;

(2) A boy climbs every tree.

(2.a) Surface scope: There is a boy who climbed every tree.

(2.b) Inverse scope: For every tree, there is a boy who climbed it.

&amp;#x200B;

This is fairly straightforward, but are long distance inverted scopes also possible? If there are three or more quantifiers, does an inverted scope exists for them too? This is what I am struggling with.

&amp;#x200B;

(3) Some man bought two cars in every car dealership.

(3.a) Surface scope: ∃ &gt; two &gt; ∀ 

\[There is a specific man and that man brought two potentially different cars in every car dealership.\]

(3.b) Intermediate scope: two &gt; ∃ &gt; ∀ 

\[There are two specific cars such that there is a potentially different man who bought the two specific cars in every dealership.\]

(3.c) Wide scope: ∀ &gt; ∃ &gt; two 

\[For every car dealership, there is a potentially different man who bought two potentially different cars.\]

(3.d) Inverted scope (?): ∀ &gt; two &gt; ∃ 

\[For every car dealership, there are two potentially different cars such that a potentially different man bought them.\]

&amp;#x200B;

Is a reading such as (3.d) possible? The more I think about it, the more plausible such a reading is, but is it an actual possible reading of (3)? Are long distance inverted scopes even possible or are there cases where they don't exist. Theoretically, they should be possible given that quantifiers behave similarly to wh-movements in that they move successive cyclically, thus not violating the phase boundaries.",1609757008,Brit_in_Lux,0

linguistics,Subglottal and Oral Pressure,"Hi /r/linguistics, I’m a ling grad waiting to hear back from grad schools right now, and I was gifted (by request :p) a copy of Matthew Gordon’s *Phonological Typology*.

In the second chapter, he goes a little into articulation in regards to stop voicing.

* “Bilabials facilitate voicing because they are associated with a relatively large oral cavity, which delays the equalization of oral and subglottal pressure that triggers cessation of vocal fold vibration”*

Can someone give a brief explanation of what this means? When does subglottal pressure build up vs oral pressure? My articulation education is sadly a little lacking other than like, the different airstream mechanics.",1609713797,Withnothing,2

I was falling asleep (reaching the point where you lose consciousness of the world around you) when I felt compelled to speak a small sentence over and over.

If you could maybe help identify what they might be I'd appreciate it.

If I spell them with phonetic examples maybe you can figure out some meaning behind them.  I also don't know where the words really start or end so bear that in mind.  It also was spoken in the intonation of a question.

The Gabo Reform led to government mandate of using Hangul in government documents, although in an interesting wording (quoting Ross King ‘Nationalism and Language Reform in Korea’ chapter in the book ‘Nationalism and the Construction of Korean Identity’ (1998)

&gt;The first government action on behalf of language reform came in the form of a royal edict in the wake of the 1894 Kab'o Reforms. The November 21,1894, ""Edict on Public Writing"" 公文式read simply,  
&gt;  
&gt;法律敕令總之國文爲本漢文附譯或混用國漢文  
&gt;  
&gt;\[범률과 칙령은 모두 국문일 기본으로 삼되, 한문으로 번역을 붙이거나 국한문을 섞어쓴다.\]  
&gt;  
&gt;All laws and edicts shall have *kungmun* as their base; one may attach a translation in *hanmun* or mix *kungmun* and *hanmun* together.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, neither the government nor any private individuals took any concrete steps to promote the use of *kungmun* following this edict, and *kukhanmun* continued its ascendance.

Yu Kil-chun apparently supported a mixed Hanja-Hangul script, although very much a ‘Korean’ nationalist who saw a loser China against Japan. In fact, I believe he even talked about adopted a Japanese-style Hun (Kun’yomi) kind of system – definitely the Fukuzawa influence there.

I'm struggling with the measuring of vowels as it seems that their frequencies are too distant. I'll show you how I do it and perhaps some of you'll be able to correct my methods and share you knowledge.

So to measure the vowels of my language I record a sentence which have the same vowels repeated several times and then I mark the vowels I'm interested in and zoom-in it. Like that:

*Processing img 9b5nx7sbjy861...*

Then I used the functions ""get first format"" and ""get second format"" and I note them down. The problem is that even though I analyze the same vowels (in difference places of the sentence) it happens to be (at least to me) too distant from each other. For example, this is my /a/ vowel.

What I noticed in relationship to that is that in languages where I memorize vocabulary more easily, I see far more color contrast between words where as with the other languages, a lot of words seem similar in color to me. 

I was wondering on whether or not my enthusiasm towards studying certain languages is effecting how much color contrast I see between different words with my synesthesia and if there's any research on the topic? Or if maybe the morphology of a language might be effecting this instead (that it's making it harder for stronger color contrast to form in my perception as an L2 learner) and if there's any past research on that? (The languages I have a harder time memorizing the words of include German and Russian and with German specifically, I thought maybe certain prefixes (mit-, bei-, be-, ver- etc) and alike might be effecting my perception since I think the first sounds of words tend to effect my perception the most, but I'm not sure)",1609607714,lia_needs_help,7

The intent being to promote intercultural understanding amongst others, something that of course is important for the Union's well-being.

However, here in Sweden, and probably lots of other countries both within and outside the EU, language classes at school have low status and are often seen as ineffective. Saying you didn't learn anything and that you hated the classes is almost a cliché at this point.
Dropping out is commonplace, and there is often a lack of qualified language teachers. The attitude that Anglophones are often criticised for: that the rest should just learn English instead of making us learn French or German, is not uncommon.

In many schools, the amount of languages you can study in school has been reduced. French is the most affected language of the three main foreign languages we have available here, the other two being Spanish and German. In various Swedish schools, French has been removed as an alternative completely, and the amount of pupils studying German is shrinking as well. Spanish is the only one of the three to see the amount of students increase, though the dropout rate is high.

linguistics,Do we know what ancient Germanic was like?,"I recently discovered a new tv show from Netflix (shame, I just canceled my subscription) called ""Barbarians"" about Arminius and the Battle of the Teutoberg Forest. What I found very interesting and admirable was that the Romans depicted in the show spoke actual classical Latin, something that, to my knowledge, has never been done on-screen (Passion of the Christ had Romans speaking ecclesiastical Latin). However, the Germanic barbarians in the show were speaking modern-day German.

This leads me to ask: Do we know what ancient Germanic sounded like? By ancient, I suppose I mean the languages spoken by the Germanic peoples during the times of the Roman Republic and Empire. There is probably a proper name for it, and I realize that it would not just be one standard language, but an umbrella category for a host of languages. Either way, people today can study (and even become fluent) in Latin, so are there scholars who study and can speak any of the ancient Germanic dialects? From some courses I've taken, I know that the Germanic peoples did not have a standardized writing system. But then again, neither did the Inca and we can still learn and speak the dialects of Quechua (However, there still exist native Quechua-speakers, and there are no longer native speakers of the ancient Germanic languages). The first written sources we have about the Germanic peoples that were written BY Germanic peoples, and not by Romans, are from the 6th century if I am not mistaken. So, from those 6th-century documents can we learn what ancient Germanic languages were like, or by then were the dialects so evolved that they would be considered a different language from the ones spoken by their ancestors at the Teutoberg Forest? Thank you for the response!

* Interesting side note: We technically do not even know how the Germanic peoples divided themselves into tribes. The tribal identities given to them (Franks vs Alemanni vs Goths) were made by the Romans. So, theoretically, a barbarian could be called a Goth but have no idea what that means. Or, tribe identities may have existed as the Roman prescribed but would have been super malleable. Ex: a Lombard is born and raised a Lombard, spends adulthood with Ostrogoths, and has the clothing or style of another tribe. Hahah anyway, just a side note.",1609545973,jeffersonfsteelflex,44

linguistics,"The odd Spanish that my g-grandmother spoke, who lived in a small town in the Venezuelan Andes","Hello :)

I was talking with my dad and he told me that his grandmother spoke somewhat differently and I was wondering if someone could explain me why.

A bit of info: the town where she was from was founded in the 1500s by the Spanish. It is located in the current state of “Trujillo”, and it had a much larger role back in the day. In between the 1700 and 1800 it got a lot of Spanish immigration (not 100% sure from what part exactly, but most likely Extremadura and Castilla y León). Then (19th and 20th century) it also got some Italian and Portuguese immigration.

Back to the language.

According to my dad, people from that and the surrounding towns speak slightly differently.

They use “vos” as second person plural, but it is different to the way it’s used in other parts of Venezuela because they say it kinda the Argentinian way. Ex:  they use “Vos sos”, instead of the more common “vos sois” that is used in Maracaibo.

In some occasions, they pronounced the &lt;j&gt; as an &lt;f&gt;
Ex: Jueves-Fueves 

Pronounced the &lt;h&gt; like some sort of aspirized version of the English one, unlike the standard Spanish version which is not pronounced. I believe this is how the first &lt;f&gt; of a word was pronounced in medieval Spanish.

They sometimes wrote and pronounced words that started by &lt;h&gt; and turned them into &lt;f&gt;. Example: Haba-Faba

And also used the word “chino” to refer to kids. I don’t really know where this comes from. In standard Spanish, it just means someone from China, but I don’t know if there’s some connection.

That’s all that my dad has told me, I might need to interview my grandfather for more.


I think it has some archaic characteristics of Spanish, but there are some things that I think are unrelated and would really like if someone could explain me why these things have changed or remained in the language, and why it’s pretty isolated there even though it’s not an isolated town.",1609476770,alizo_,13

linguistics,Very simple question about ambiguity.,"I wrote my linguistics friend about something. She knows a ton about linguistics but her intuition seems to be the opposite of mine so one of us must be extremely wrong here. 

I said this: 

&gt;Consider the sentence: “Chomsky has great intelligence and great integrity, which has gotten him into trouble in certain circles.” That’s a bad sentence, since “which” can refer to one thing or two things. There’s a way to eliminate the ambiguity, but I’ve only ever seen one author (David Wallace) use this style. It’s a strange style. This is how Wallace would write it to clarify it: “Chomsky has great intelligence and great integrity, which integrity has gotten him into trouble in certain circles.” I’ve only ever seen Wallace use this style. What do you make of that? It’s probably common in academic writing, but comes across as strange to a non-academic person. Below are some highlighted examples of Wallace doing this. 

She said: 

&gt;I don’t see anything wrong with the sentence.  Language commonly involves reference to compound events: “to arrive late and get a seat is (not are) unusual”.  Wallace is employing a literary affectation, useful for his purposes, not normal usage.

I said: 

&gt;Why don't you see how horrendously ambiguous this sentence is? “Chomsky has great intelligence and great integrity, which has gotten him into trouble in certain circles.” It's impossible to answer this question: ""Did Chomsky's intelligence play any role in Chomsky getting into trouble?"" The sentence's entire meaning is totally unclear. It's a garbage sentence. 

&gt;I come across probably 10 hopelessly ambiguous sentences every day, and it bothers me. Often in transcripts of Chomsky interviews, but all over the place. The only solution to infuriating ambiguity is to be mechanically cautious. See the examples below. 

&gt;**""Chomsky is extremely smart and nice."" --&gt; ""Chomsky is extremely smart and extremely nice.""** In the first sentence, it's totally unclear whether extremely is supposed to apply to ""nice."" 

&gt;**""Chomsky has great intelligence and great integrity, which has gotten him into trouble in certain circles."" --&gt; ""Chomsky has great intelligence and great integrity, and the integrity has gotten him into trouble in certain circles.""** In the first sentence, it's not clear whether intelligence played a role in getting Chomsky into trouble. 

She said: 

&gt;The sentence is completely clear, though like every sentence, it doesn’t answer every imaginable question.  It says, clearly and unambiguously, that intelligence and integrity got him into trouble.

I said this: 

&gt;It's extremely odd that you and I don't have the same response to this sentence: ""Chomsky has great intelligence and great integrity, which has gotten him into trouble in certain circles."" This is shocking to me. I would like to see a poll of people. My strong assumption is that a large % of people polled would say that the word ""which"" either ***does*** apply only to ""integrity"" or the least ***may*** apply only to ""integrity.""

Near as I can tell, /k/ is followed by a uvular fricative or trill /kχ/ /kʀ̥/ syllable-initially, or is replaced altogether /χ/ /ʀ̥/ syllable-finally, in the vicinity of L, in accents that have pervasively velarised “dark” L [ɫ]—examples: “closure” [k͡χɫoʊʒɚ], “like” [ɫɜɪχ], “technically” [ˈtʰɛk̚.nɪχ.ˌɫi]. (Not sure if I’ve got the rest of the transcription right, but it’s less relevant.)

This seems like a surprising change to me unless it went through some other shift like [kʰ] → [k͡x] first, but again, not sure about that.

linguistics,Best way to express some ambiguous logical concepts in English," Hello everyone,

I am looking for the best way to express some logical concepts in English. I would need some help for that since I am not a native speaker.

For the following steps, I will first explain the concept in a more verbose way (description as D) and then write the more concise form (corresponding question as Q). For the sake of the explanation, I will refer to the film domain.

1. `D1: List of people that starred in a Spielberg film. They also need to be the producer of any of the Spielberg films.`
2. `Q1: Who starred in and produced a Spielberg film?`
3. `D2: List of people that starred in a Spielberg film and produced the same film.`
4. `Q2: Who starred in a Spielberg film and also produced it?`
5. `D3: List of people that starred in more than 3 Spielberg films and produced more than 3 Spielberg films. The two sets of films don't need to be the same.`
6. `Q3: Who starred in and produced more than 3 Spielberg films?`
7. `D4: List of people that starred in more than 3 Spielberg films. They also need to be producer of all of these films.`
8. `Q4_1: Who starred in and also produced more than 3 Spielberg films?`
9. `Q4_2: Who starred in more than 3 Spielberg films and also produced them?`

What is the best way to say that a pair of actions (i.e., starring and producing) refers to the same set of objects (i.e., films) or not, without the two sets being exclusive?

Could you please help me to rephrase these questions, if you think they are ambiguous and not easy to understand or to use?

linguistics,"Why doesn't the PIE ""desiderative"" suffix count as a future tense?","I've been reading *Indo-European Language and Culture* by Benjamin W. Fortson and frankly having a difficult time understanding why the desiderative suffix, \**-s-*, doesn't count as a future tense. He specifically said that PIE doesn't have a future tense, but honestly it seems like it would warrant a metaphysical explanation for why, e.g., Vedic Sanskrit *dāsyáti* means ""he intends/wants to give"" and not ""he will give."" This is admittedly made more confusing by the fact that English's own ""future"" tense is really just an auxiliary verb meaning ""to want,"" whereas the PIE suffix doesn't (on the face of it) have any connection to an etymology meaning ""want,"" ""intend,"" or ""desire"" that I know of.

He doesn't really explain this, but my only guess would be that the desiderative suffix only appeared on verbs attached to rational beings capable of *wanting* something, so in PIE one couldn't say, ""a rock will fall from the cliff"" because a rock cannot ""want"" anything. But how would we know that the \**-s-* suffix didn't get attached to such verbs, especially since by the time we see it in Vedic Sanskrit and Ancient Greek we *do* see it attached to abstract and non-rational subjects?

Consonants followed by front vowels (e, i) become palatalized while ones followed by back vowels (a, o, u) become velarized. My problem with the previous statement is that I can't seem to hear this velarization (e.g. \[bˠ\]) anywhere.

linguistics,Does the sonority hierarchy operate at the phonemic or phonetic level?,"The sonority hierarchy seems to be a rather murky thing, with most authors just sort of presenting their version of it with little or no explanation as to how they arrived at their own particular arrangement of things. There is, of course, some admirable experimental work out there, but it tends to be focused on English.

Anyway, as I wade through dealing with it in a language I work on, I've come to wonder -- does the sonority hierarchy operate at the phonological or the phonetic level? In English this doesn't seem to matter, and the hierarchy is posited at the phoneme level, as pretty much all of its phonemes' allophones are quite similar to each other within a given phoneme (the notable exception being the flapped \[ɾ\] that's an allophone of /t/ and /d/ in AmE).

But that's far from a universal situation. To cite just one example, German /r/ can be a voiced fricative (glottal or uvular) , but it can also be an alveolar tap or even occasionally a trill. And in just about every sonority hierarchy out there, taps and trills have a higher sonority index than fricatives. This would seem to suggest that the hierarchy should be posited at the allophonic level, since a single phoneme that can be realized as either a fricative or a tap/trill is not susceptible to a generalization about sonority.

This is just an example, of course. Imagine, if you will, a language with several phonemes which have as allophones a voiced approximant, a voiced fricative, a voiceless fricative and a voiced affricate. Would the sonority hierarchy of such a language not have to be posited at the allophonic level?",1609215039,pastoralslaughter,6

linguistics,An amateur philologist developing interest in this field (specifically the reconstruction of Germanic tongues),"I'm in law school now, but I'm a Classicist at heart. I developed an interest in the Germanic tribes Rome tussled with in my undergrad, but couldn't go very far with it other than reading about them in Tacitus or other ethnographers. With more time on my hands during break, I've turned my attention back to them. As a philologist, my first instinct is ""how did they express themselves textually and verbally?"" Clearly the former is mostly unanswerable currently, but I wondered what scholars have come up with for the latter.

Man what a rabbit hole. I see linguists doing immense legwork collating surviving scraps of runes and loanwords, trying to map out what Frankish, Suebic, Alemannic etc. could have looked like. What really caught my attention was the reconstruction of Proto-Germanic. I've seen PIE and it looks like a keyboard seizure; PGc, however, looks like something I could imagine Arminius shouting while sending down his ambush in the Teutoburg. I love the earthy sounds of the old Germanic reconstructions; modern German seems downright genteel in comparison

Long story short, my interest in the reconstruction of the more ancient branches of the Germanic families has piqued my interest. I'm very much wondering how someone with NO linguistic training can acquire some literature on the work being done here.

I thought about how I had the funny habit of pronouncing the E in “every” like the A in “Avery”, and how this other person pronounces the E in “well” like the A in “wail”. After a mutual friend described this person’s accent as Northeastern, I wondered if this E-like-A pronunciation is indeed unique to Northeastern accents? 

And although I did not grow up in Michigan but rather a nearby state, would my old habit of saying “every” like “avery” be considered the same phenomenon as pronouncing “well” like “wail”?

linguistics,What would constitute counter-evidence to the prime-status of Wierzbickan semantic primes?,"I would like to have a discussion about this  


Experience(by that I mean that which happens and is noticed) is leading to me believe that Wierzbickan primes are not indivisible or indescribable   


If one assumes time to exist, and that there is one moment, and then the other, then each object that every prime is making reference to can be described as something that occurs across a period of time. Each one can be explained, at least to some extent, as a process  


Wierzbicka in her writings sometimes provides explications of things by making reference to how the word is about something that happens in a timespan greater than one moment  


Frequently, there is the explication component ""Because of this"". There is an assumption of cause and effect. One can explain the reason for the existance of a prime, at least partly, by making reference to any one of the set of circumstances which aggregate to the very existence of the prime itself  


What are called primes are things happen across time. What are called primes are things that happen because of other things. What are called primes are things that exist within the context of language, which came about for a set of reasons. You can explain so much about them. Why are they prime?  


Because of this, I don't understand what makes something a semantic prime. Apart from the assertion (which I see frequently in Wierzbickan texts) that they cannot be explained without circularity.   


But what evidence is there that circularity is not a valid explanation for what a semantic prime is?  


For example, prime X:  
\-----

Some things that are true about prime X could be explicated using the set of all semantic primes which are not X.  


Some of those sets of semantic primes which are not X could in turn be explicated in terms of  X itself  
\----

I have been thinking for a few years now that this may have something to do with interdependent origination and the notion of emptiness from eastern philosophy, at least insofar as lexical semantics is concerned  


I would also like to note that the apparent boundary between primes seems to blur if one lets it. By this I mean that what are called semantic primes kinda change in meaning, the relationship between two given primes changes too, upon engaging in meditative practices.

linguistics,What is the 'me' in 'I love me some X' called?,"Having learned English in the southeastern United States, I consider phrases like 'I love me some pasta' a grammatically correct (albeit fairly informal) alternative to 'I love pasta'. I've never consciously thought about this until now, but it's an interesting way to use a pronoun and one I haven't encountered anywhere else yet. Does this have a specific name, and does this occur in your native language? 

Some other things I've noticed about my usage specifically:

* This phrasing can be applied to third person pronouns, but using second person pronouns feels off. I would never say 'You love you some pasta'.
* Using the reflexive third person pronouns (herself, themself, etc) feels more natural than the corresponding object pronouns (her, them, etc) to me. I would say 'he loves himself some pasta' instead of 'he loves him some pasta'. 
* Curiously, this distinction doesn't exist for the first person. 'I love me some pasta' and 'I love myself some pasta' sound equally natural to me.
* To my knowledge, 'some' cannot be replaced by any other determiner. Consequently I don't think I'd ever say 'I love me any apples' or something to that effect.

They were the muse-mews merger and rode-road merger, both said to not be merged by some welsh speakers. At first I was convinced by the muse-mews merger but was caught off guard as I was pretty sure that ""rode"" and ""road"" were always pronounced the same, so I did some googling. I stumbled upon [this wiki](https://helpresentdayenglish.fandom.com/wiki/Present_Day_English_Wiki) where is you just search merger or split lists a ton I'd never seen (list below). I was pretty sure most of these words had always been pronounced the same, and these pages didn't seem to have any references but most of them stated that that were kept separate in parts of Scotland or Wales (though it even claims that some Scottish speakers don't have the sent-cent merger, which I am pretty sure is just false), so I thought maybe it's a spelling pronunciation and/or the application of another languages orthographic rules onto English. So even though I pretty sure most of these are fake, I am asking if anyone has any info or readings into any of these or can just confirm they're fake.

linguistics,Non-alphabetic languages and subvocalization,"There’s a feedback loop between written and spoken words. The written words exist to transcribe spoken words BUT in practical terms many words are learned by reading and not by writing. So while conceptually a written word is a label for a spoken one, practically it can be the reverse - think of dead languages, foreign words acquired mostly through reading, or even one’s own native language, where the larger part of the lexicon is rarely used in day-to-day conversations. The fact that in these situations you can have a wrong pronunciation shows that in subvocalizing a text you read, in order to keep the flow, you simply have to have a placeholder sound. Of course with alphabetic systems, even if the language is dead, you can get from the text at least an approximation of how you were meant to sound the words, so this placeholder will not be too far from the mark; however, in non alphabetic writing systems, like the Chinese one, this placeholder - if you were to be studying Chinese as an archeologist in a far future when it is a dead language - could be almost arbitrary. 

So the question (possibly very silly) is: to understand a non-alphabetic written text, do you anyway need some sound, even if arbitrary? Or is it possible to read such languages in a mode different from the aural one?",1608809136,FantasyTroll,4

linguistics,Any particular reason why French has less tenses compared to other Romance languages like Spanish?,"Hey everyone,

So I've been studying French for many years now, and I've recently started to learn Spanish as well. Of course, already knowing one Romance language has made my learning of Spanish much easier than if I was starting from scratch, and along the way I've noticed some interesting quirks and differences between the two languages. One particular difference I've noticed is in the tenses: French appears to have less tenses than Spanish, or, at least, French has certain dropped tenses. Two that I've noticed are in the present continuous tense and in the perfect (?). 

* In English, for instance, we can say ""I speak"" and ""I am speaking,"" but in French, both come out to one form: ""je parle."" Practically speaking, there is no continuous tense besides the special être en train de construction, which is rare.
* Spanish, however, keeps the distinction: I speak = hablo, while I am speaking = estoy hablando.

In the past, it's a similar story.

* In English, we can say ""I spoke"" or ""I have spoken,"" but in French, both translate to one form, ""j'ai parlé."" The equivalent tense to ""I spoke,"" the passé simple, has essentially dropped out of common discourse (and I think it can also be used for both forms anyway). 
* But in Spanish, I spoke = hablé, while I have spoken = he hablado (well they can also take the imperfect form, but that's a whole other discussion). 

So, is there any particular reason for these dropped tenses in French? Why did the language lose these distinctions while Spanish kept them?",1608768488,shivj80,104

Okay. So I know a little Japanese. Japanese has totally degenerated from its classical forms (which would be unintelligible to today's speakers, largely) to a sort of maybe forgive me ""lazier/easier"" form.

So, why do we have ""less degenerated"" forms. How did these develop? Was it a kind of high literary style of the elite who created a system out of a collision of language, then it had to spread and degenerate to the masses?

On the other hand, is this historical/sociological? Where small elites of the civitas once dominated religion and language, but with the late iron age these systems had to distribue out to a wider population?

If laguanges simplify and degenerate, how do the reach the more precise/complex starting point?

Meanwhile, black, white red and other ""peppers"" exist, which are also ""hot"".

It's confusing in other languages too - in Germany, bell peppers are paprika, also the powdered form, chilis are chilis (or peperoni - Italian for all bell peppers), pepper the spice is pfeffer. But then, the curveball, cayenne pepper is cayenne pfeffer. WTF? Even worse, allspice, which is nothing to do with either kind of pepper is called ""piment"", because it looks a bit like black pepper. (But pimento is Portuguese for bell peppers...)

Italian and Swiss German refers to bell peppers as peperoni/-e which is clearly derived from ""pepe"", which means pepper the spice. In non-Swiss german, peperoni is only used for hot chili peppers in certain contexts.

Some Americans try to make sense of things by referring to bell peppers by their scientific name ""capsicum"" but stick with peppers when referring to the closely related hot varieties. At least they tried...

Absolute clusterfuck, especially when living in Europe and trying to translate, because even if you translate accurately, the various direct translations of the term *pepper* are used more or less arbitrarily. Bit of a problem for something that many people can't eat (heat tolerance, allergies and so on)

I quite like the idea of an IAL, but it can be safe to say that esperanto hasn't achieved it's big goal as of yet. Is it possible in the future? Maybe. But it's hard to do, and it's not the most likely item (I can see English remaining dominant for the next few decades as Mandarin slowly creeps up on it). So, why have so many IALs failed, and better yet, how can we fix this failures? Well first off, IALs have a tendency to fail because for most people there really is no reason to learn them. I love languages and treat them as a hobby, but most people don't. Why bother learning another language if you're a native english speaker. If you're a native spanish speaker, why bother learning a language other than English? It just seems pointless. Second, many many IALs lack a culture or stories. Tolkien once said that Esperanto is dead because it lacks legends. While I don't think this is true anymore, for things like Toki Pona, Ido, or others, it is probably true. Third, they can be unnecessarily difficult at times, and they can take a while to learn. Esperanto is a relatively easy language to learn, but it still takes time. In particular, the accusative case can be a nightmare for beginners (I still struggle with it sometimes). Fourth, many have a european bias (Ido, Esperanto, Interlingua, etc).

So now, for the more interesting bit, how do we address these problems? Well I can see a couple ways forward. I am by no means a language expert, so keep that in mind. First, the lack of a reason to learn them. When I told friends I was learning Esperanto I always got the same question: ""What's the point?"" That's a fair question. I did it cause I love the ideal, but again, that's not going to be the case for everyone. So, what should we do? Well, I think the best way is to accept the current political and economic reality. English is the dominant language in the world today. Most people want to learn English, or at least be able to understand some of it. That's fair. So, what that means is that we need an IAL that will help people on that path. It can draw from English in some way. English pronunciation is one of the hardest parts of the language, so since we want an IAL to be easy, we should avoid using English words like through, tough, words that have different sounds despite the same spelling. These words are very difficult for foreign learners to master. Instead, we should aim to provide sorta an intro to the basics of english, perhaps borrow some English vocabulary and grammar rules (no gender, and to make things easier no conjugation. So I now has, You now has, She now has, They now has, I did has, You did has, She did has, They did has, so on and so forth). So, in those phrases you can see the pronoun from english (which is obviously useful to new learners), words indicating tense (now, will, did), and a constant conjugation (has). Has is an actual english conjugation (I have, she has, etc), so that english word is conveyed. Now of course, this idea may seem very very very biased towards english. So how do you get around that? well you don't just incorporate english vocabulary, you use english for the very common words (thus giving a bit of incentive to learn this IAL and giving learners a dash of english). If an english learned said to you ""She now has cokolado"", most of us could work out what that means. This IAL would effectively teach broken english for common words and verbs, and the rest would be based on other languages. this still gives a rather unfair bias to english though. So, perhaps tonal elements could be introduced to give the speaker some basic understanding of chinese tonal elements (the new rising lingua franca (potentially)). So the various tenses could each have their own tone and vocab. You as a native english speaker would still understand, but it conveys the idea of tones to the learner which is a concept many struggle with in mandarin. Effectively, this IAL would use its grammar and vocab as a sort of bridge to help learn other potentially more immediately useful languages for the learner. Esperanto has some of these qualities, but it draws too heavily from European languages and not Asian or African ones. This is a problem. Would this give english speakers an initial advantage? yes, but that advantage would be balanced out as more specific topics need to be learned. Most english learners can get by with half-way decent english. You don't need to be fluent to survive in the US or UK, or wherever you live that is english speaking. That sort of language would be enough. The really tough english words can be replaced with words that are spelled differently or are perhaps found from other languages. So, this solves the fundamental incentive problem. This IAL acts as an easier and quicker way to learn basic english whilst also learning some key concepts for mandarin. Will it be enough to get you to survive in China? No, but it could be enough to at least get by in the english speaking world and to a lesser degree in a smattering of other countries. Is this ideal and super fair to everyone? No. But it does get over that initial incentive hurdle. Esperanto doesn't really do this as it's vocab is mostly romance based. 

The next part is interesting, the cultures and stories bit. So with a somewhat broken english, you can sorta understand a lot of english cultural stuff, but combine that with vocab from other languages (perhaps this IAL can have reflexive verbs or something), you can begin to pick up on other cultures too. So you may not understand everything said in a telenovela, but you can kinda get by. The point of this IAL is to let you kinda get by in the countries with current dominant languages and let you experience that culture. Furthermore, if the creators of this IAL are willing to put in the work, they can translate stuff (I have an esperanto copy of the hobbit, so it's not unheard of).

One thing I quite like about Toki Pona is the fact you can learn it in like 2 days and be fluent. That's because of its limited vocab. Esperanto takes far longer to learn and it still comes off as euro-centric. So the goal of this language should be fast learning time. There should be a core of like 200 or so words used in day to day life, with a good number inspired from english and the rest from languages like mandarin, spanish, russian, swahali, tagalog, etc. These could be learned quickly. With a basic grammar structure, the core needed for conversation could be learned in like a week or two. This is far less time commitment than Esperanto and isn't asking much of the learner. Hell, the shorter the time frame the less english we need to inject (cause less incentive is needed), so people are more likely to take it up.

This last point is the hardest to address. Yes, this language would have an english bias, but frankly I don't know how else to get people to learn it. The initial phases would be easier for english speakers, but it could help incentive others to start learning it as well. More complex ideas and concepts could be based on other languages (like reflexive pronouns, abandonment of the indefinite article (like in Esperanto), adding tones, legalese vocabulary, political vocabulary, scientific vocabulary, etc). This bias at the start can be balanced by other biases towards the end. That's the only real way I see around that.

linguistics,"In the case of the San Francisco Bay Area, is it likely, or even possible, that in the future an accent or dialect will form and would it be likely for immigrant languages to enter the lexicon","I’m from the Bay Area, a geographic area that includes nine Northern California counties that border the San Francisco Bay that has, in a way, sort of culturally separated itself from other parts of Northern California. We don’t really have an accent or dialect, it’s essentially standard American English. I don’t even think there was a substantial accent in this area at any time in the past. The Bay does have a lot of unique slang terms that mostly arose from african americans, like most of the Bay’s culture, the most notable words Bay Area people claim are probably “hella” “slaps” “fucks with” “giggin” “swoop” “good looks” and “tryna”. I’m skeptical if some of these actually had a Bay Area origin, especially “hella” “fucks with” and “tryna”. Most of these slang terms are derived from English itself and not other languages. I’m aware that the internet and other forms of mass media make new dialects unlikely and caused existing dialects to decrease in speakers but I know this isn’t always the case. The most notable example I can think of to the contrary is Multicultural London English which itself is a fairly young dialect. The Bay Area is more diverse than it has ever been at this point, even if the city of San Francisco itself has become less diverse due to poorer and non white residents being pushed out by raising rent costs. Off the top of my head the languages other than English that are fairly common in the Bay Area are Mexican Spanish, Tagalog, Vietnamese, European Portuguese, Samoan, Tongan, Farsi/Dari, Mandarin Chinese (most older Chinese immigrants speak Cantonese but to my knowledge they are outnumbered by newer mandarin speaking immigrants), and South Asian languages (mainly Punjabi, Hindi and Fiji Hindi). Though many of these immigrant communities are fairly young, very few of their words have entered normal lexicon apart from a few spanish words that have mostly become obscure slang that the larger population does not use. I have a skater friend who says “fueg”, derived from the Spanish word for fire “fuego” to describe when something is cool, like when you say something is fire. I mean could words enter the lexicon the same way many Yiddish words entered the New York City lexicon. The Bay Area has also in recent years had an influx of people from other parts of the US and Canada come here to work in the tech industry, these are people of all races but in all honestly they are overwhelmingly of white. I’ve also seen an influx of upper class and upper middle class European immigrants from places like France, Germany, Belgium Russia, etc, arrive to the area as well but not in numbers even close to as large as Asian and Latin American immigrants are coming to the area and haven’t had as much of a cultural impact as them or the Bay’s very old Portuguese American community. So those two groups could add to this linguistic melting pot as well. The African Americans and Chicanos of the Bay have in a way developed their own lingos, though they don’t stray too far from African American Vernacular English or Chicano English, what they have might actually even be what I’m asking about in all honesty, maybe it just hasn’t broken the barrier into the wider population. The people of this subreddit are very intelligent so I’d like to see your take on this. Will an accent/dialect likely develop in the future? If so will it include words from immigrant languages?",1608459497,klingonbussy,2

linguistics,What’s the story behind “an historic”?,"This question has been asked here before, but the most recent one I could find was six years ago and none of the answers linked any sources, so I hope it’s okay to bring it up again.

So “an historic” is obviously fine in accents that don’t pronounce the word-initial H (rendering it as “an ‘istoric”), but I very frequently see people with accents that do pronounce it writing and saying “an historic”, even when it clearly doesn’t correspond with the “use ‘an’ before a vowel sound” rule. It always seems to be “historic”, too; though this may be anecdotal, I’ve never seen this phenomenon proliferate to the same extent with other H adjectives like “heroic” or “hectic”. I’ve seen the justification that this originated to ensure that the audience didn’t think you were writing/saying “ahistoric”, but I’m curious if this is a post-hoc rationalization, because a) people can generally figure these things out from pronunciation and context clues, and b) we don’t do this with other words that might cause similar confusion. “Amoral” is a word, for example, but nobody says “an moral”.

linguistics,Intentional ungrammaticality is rather common in French comedy. What about other languages?,"Hello!

As the title says, a common way to make something sound funnier in my native French is to deliberately use bad grammar, often to imply that a character is a ""know-nothing know-it-all"".

Some common forms of humorous ungrammaticality are:

* Misconjugated verbs, especially when using irregular ones or uncommon forms such as the simple past or the imperfect subjunctive.
* Incorrect preposition+definite article combinations ""de le"" and ""de les"" instead of the proper contractions *du* and *des*.
* Mispluralized nouns, especially the ones ending in -*al* due to their unpredictability (some have the plural ending -*als*, others have -*aux*), for instance *chacal* (jackal) is often humorously pluralized as ""chacaux"" instead of *chacals*.
* Misdivided words due to liaison, for instance saying ""nenfant"" instead of *enfant* (child) because *un enfant* (a child) is pronounced /ɛ̃n‿ɑ̃fɑ̃/.
* Exaggeratedly long interrogative constructions, you might have heard of the *qu'est-ce que c'est que ça?* (what's this?, literally ""what's this that it's that this?""), which is correct French, but humorous ungrammatical ones are also common.
* Metatheses, spelling pronunciations, pleonasms and mixed-up expressions.

Some examples:

* The comedy film *La Cité de la peur* (The City of Fear), which was made by a team of comedians known as Les Nuls (The Dummies), is called ""Le film de Les Nuls"" instead of *Le film des Nuls* (The Dummies' movie) on its posters and in its opening credits.
* In another comedy film, *La Classe américaine* (The American Class), the characters consistently mispronounce *film* as ""flim"" and *quiche lorraine* as ""ouiche lorraine"", even the narrator. The narrator also reads aloud some country names on an English map and pronounces ""south"" as /sut/.
* *Les Guignols de l'Info* (The News Puppets), a satirical puppet show, often caricatures celebrities this way. For instance, when the cyclist Richard Virenque was accused of doping, his puppet in the show claimed to have been doped ""à l'insu de son plein gré"" (""unbeknownst to his willingness"").
* The inhabitants of Groland (a fictional France-like country featured in various comedy shows on the channel Canal+) are portrayed as so dumb that even their country's *motto* contains a misconjugated verb, it's ""Groland, je mourrirai pour toi"" instead of *Groland, je mourrai pour toi* (Groland, I shall die for thee). You can buy T-shirts saying ""viendez au Groland"" instead of *venez au Groland* (come to Groland).
* In *Crossed*, his review/comedy show about video game-related movies, the critic Karim Debbache says ""pendant ce temps-là, dans le vrai monde réel de la réalité véritable..."" (meanwhile, in the true real world of actual reality...) whenever a movie cuts between a video game (especially in movies involving virtual reality) and the real world. In his other movie review/comedy show, *Chroma*, he also says ""qui que c'est qu'est gentil et qui que c'est qu'est méchant?"" (""who that it's that's the good guys and who that it's that's the bad guys?"") instead of *qui est gentil et qui est méchant?* (who are the good guys and who are the bad guys?) when he tries to explain the convoluted plot of *Knock Off* to the audience, he even spells ""qui que c'est qu'est"" as ""kikséké"".

linguistics,Old-English =&gt; Middle-English," Some observations I've made:

1. By the 16th century, Middle-English had more or less become the common language of England, making Old-English a legacy.
2. Morphologically valid terminology from Old-English was reappropriated into Middle-English, gradually shaping the words we know today, like 'hurry', 'alone', 'assassinate', 'common', 'submerge', 'amazement', and more.
3. What seems to have disappeared in the transition is; 1) The rich 'base vocabulary' of Proto-Germanic/Old-English, and 2) the 'morphological liberty' that permeates the Germanic languages - morphemes like compound words, prefixes, and suffixes.

What would be the most accurate way to end this statement:

""English authors between 1560-1620 were the first to introduce a range of new concepts, including those mentioned above, for;

1. *Middle-English specifically*
2. *the English language in general*
3. *the Germanic languages as a whole*
4. *all languages universally* 

Since my claims would invalidate options 2, 3, and 4, I am interested in knowing more about how the historical narrative approaches the topic.

I.e., are we to assume that languages before Middle-English couldn't convey the concept of loneliness through the use of pre-existing morphemes?

If no, what is the purpose of shaping new words through morphological techniques only to permanently fuse them together in their composite form?

If yes, I would like to elaborate on how such a notion is highly improbable and misunderstood from an etymological perspective.",1608331220,tiamaxx,5

linguistics,"Relationship between linguistic background, second language acquisition and how languages shape our thoughts","Hello everyone,

I was reading a paper on the effect our linguistic background has on a second language, showing that it is easier to learn a language that shares linguistic similarities (phonologically, morphologically, and lexically) with your own. 

Now, a while ago I came across this TED talk by cognitive scientist Lera Boroditsky ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKK7wGAYP6k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKK7wGAYP6k)), who had been trying to weigh in on the ancient question: “Do languages shape the way we think?”  She discovered some intruiging differences in how people think about time, orientation, colour spectrum, gender, etc., depending on the language they grew up with. For example, someone who grows up with a language in which there are many different words to describe the colour spectrum will be better at discerning between different colours than people who grew up with a language that distinguishes between fewer colours.

My questions are the following: if someone who had acquired a particular second language after the ‘critical/sensitive period’ would that person also gain some of the cognitive effects brought about by the particular sounds, vocabulary, structure, etc. of that language or would that person remain totally unaffected? Secondly, would this be an extra constraint on second language acquisition? I imagine, having to learn about new colours (or at least you didn't make a distinction between certain colours) would make learning extra hard? Or would this become easier over time, precisely because you're learning this new language?",1608249211,Just-a-curious-gal,10

Link to the actual study:  http://www.sayurihayakawa.com/uploads/9/5/4/2/95429602/hayakawakeysar2018.pdf


Although the paper of the study mentions proficiency in the second language may play a role, the article from the independent.co.uk does not say anything about that. 

From the study paper: 

“That said, there is some indication that proficiency may play a role. While we did not find notable proficiency effects for Experiments 2 and 3, in Experiment 1, we find that foreign language proficiency moderates the language effect on imagery for the auditory (B = −0.19, SE=0.09, p=.035) and motor modalities (B=−0.22, SE=0.08, p = .007). In these cases, the effect of language is most pronounced for lower proficiency participants. This raises the possibility that profi- ciency and other aspects of linguistic experience may affect how much people’s imagery changes as a function of language.”",1608244155,nerd1999,96

linguistics,Puerto Rican Spanish: NYC vs On Island,"Hi! I’m writing a final paper for my linguistics class. I choose to tack the languages and their dialects throughout time amongst the populations of Puerto Rico. I’ve only gotten up to the era of American Imperialism so far. I need to go into the State Side of things more. 

My main goal is to compare and contrast the modern-day Puerto Rican Spanish spoken on the island of Puerto Rico to that spoken in New York City, NY. I want to make note of the influences on the speech in both regions, such as the Indigenous language(s) spoken in Puerto Rico/the Caribbean (Taíno, mainly), political intervention, access to education, both State Side and On Island assimilation, etc.  

Does anyone have any resources that I could use or look into? I’ve read everything about Puerto Rico, Caribbean Spanish (and other dialects of Spanish spoken in the region now and during Spanish conquest), and Taíno on Wikipedia, but I want more about the NYC side of things.

what they likely meant is that some aspect of the article appealed to *them*. Maybe it felt insightful. Maybe is felt well-written. At issue here is these are all characteristics with varying levels of subjectivity.

And I'm trying to understand, among other things, what reactions are like on the other side when someone says ""this is a good \_\_\_\_\_"". Really, it could be as simple as asking does that statement feel invalidating or not.

Any question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate discussion all of the time, here are some examples: 

*Quick questions:*

* Asking for an explanation of a technical term
* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature
* Asking how we would transcribe something
* Asking how a feature works in a particular language

*Not-so-quick questions:*

* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

Also, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search.

linguistics,Commas for lists and parentheticals at the same time,"In the novel ""The Sound and The Fury"", the first chapter which is narrated by an intellectually disabled man starts with the sentence:

First of all, is this grammatically correct? Here, if ""between the flower spaces"" is a parenthetical, it should be describing the fence(Please correct me if I'm wrong). But the commas are really separating elements of a list because ""Between the flower spaces, I could see them hitting"" and ""Through the fence, I could see them hitting"" are both grammatically correct(Please correct me if I am wrong). So am I right in assuming that the sentence really needs a conjunction instead of the first comma because there are only two elements in the list like ""Through the fence and between the flower spaces, I could see them hitting."" I am confused because ""between the flower spaces"" clearly is not talking about the fence. It's talking about the way the narrator is looking through the fence.

linguistics,Redundant modals,"Consider the different modals licensed by the following two phrases: ""might be confirmed"" versus ""might be confirmable."" When I say that ""X might be confirmed,"" the modal operator may have an epistemic *or* a deontic flavor; i.e., I may mean (1) ""perhaps X has been confirmed \[though its status as confirmed or unconfirmed is unknown\]"" or (2) ""X is eligible for confirmation \[according to some regulative set of norms\]."" We can swap out ""confirmed"" for any arbitrary verb and get the same bifurcation — albeit with variation in tenses: ""confirmed"" can be read here as a past participle in a predicative expression (""X is \[something which has been\] confirmed"") rather than a component of a single verb ""be confirmed"" (whose flavor is futural). 

What happens when we swap about ""confirm"" for ""confirmable""? The epistemic reading, according to my own intuitions (I'd be curious to hear others), is forced. We have to understand the phrase as ""perhaps X is capable of being confirmed \[though its status as confirmable or unconfirmable is unknown\]."" 

Upon some investigation, this makes sense: the deontic reconstruction would be redundant. We'd get ""X is *eligible* for *eligibility* for confirmation \[according to some regulative set of norms\]."" This pattern appears to hold for any verb with an ""-able"" suffix, for obvious reasons. 

I'm wondering if you can get the same forcing effect with redundant epistemic modals. The idea, to speak approximately, is to smuggle a duplicate ""perhaps"" into the semantics of the verb form, just as we smuggled a duplicate ""eligible"" into the semantics of the verb form above. The best example I can think of is ""might be uncertain \[indeterminate, etc\]."" This would generate the following epistemic reading of the modal operator: ""perhaps X is perhaps known \[but we can't know\]."" 

Going on sheer parallelism, you would think that the redundancy would disqualify this interpretation  as it did in the deontic case. But I don't have that intuition at all: I feel perfectly comfortable parsing the phrase as involving two references to epistemic uncertainty. What is it about the epistemic modal that can survive redoubling? 

My answer is the following: 

This isn't a true redoubling. In the framed case (""X is uncertain""), we're talking about the uncertainty that X is known by anyone all (or by whoever the contextually relevant investigators are); in the framing case (introduced by ""X might be""), we're talking about the uncertainty that the *speaker* knows the knowledge-state of *all* such relevant investigators. We could theoretically resolve the former uncertainty without resolving the latter uncertainty: the speaker's response entails that she doesn't know X herself (otherwise, there'd be no framed uncertainty), so if we go ask all of the other relevant investigators about their knowledge-states, we can figure out whether ""X is indeed uncertain."" This would not give us information to resolve the speaker's own uncertainty, of course, because we haven't changed her information state. 

I feel reasonably satisfied with this account, but it leaves me wondering. Could you ever have true epistemic redundancy? Thoughts?",1607922561,postsure,1

My interest in literature overlaps with my interest in things like philosophy and especially linguistics. Now, we can take James Joyce’s “Finnegans Wake”, for example. I’m looking to take my sentences under a microscope, I’m looking to construct their syntax under a meaningful style. It’s sort of difficult to explain what I mean, so please bare with me. If any of you are familiar with “Finnegans Wake” or “Ulysses”, for that matter, Samuel Beckett and or Gertrude Stein, you know that they employ odd/incorrect syntax or stylistic choices for the sake of meaning, or to enhance the reading experience in some artistic way. Now, I’ve never really looked at my sentences under a microscope...(what I mean by this is that I’ve never pulled apart my sentences and map out what every word is functioning as). But I recently read William H. Gass’ “The Architecture of the Sentence” and was blown away. He dissected various examples of sentences and wrote pages on what they were doing, and he also drew venn diagrams and  actually put them in a similar order as an architect would write up their plans. Basically, what I’m looking to do, is really experiment with syntax and meaning, perhaps some people would label sentences that don’t fall under correct syntax as “asyntactical”? To make a long story short, I’m looking for a sort of starting point as to how linguistics function with artistic prose, it’s evident how it appears in classical poetry (rhyme, rhythm, meter etc.) but less so for prose in which it uses sentences and not lines.

linguistics,Evolution of Japanese and Korean Written Scripts from late-19th to early 20th century? (and role of intellectual movements on that?),"Weird question, but just curious how the written scripts of Japan and Korea became more “Japanese” and more “Korean” respectively, as opposed to a mostly trying to use Literary Chinese (漢文 Kanbun in Japanese and Hanmun in Korean) to represent the local vernacular – especially from late 19th century to early 20th century –. I know there isn’t a clear line to say where the scripts becomes “purely” Japanese or Korean – it’s all a gradual process of linguistic evolution. Nevertheless, I’m curious of the processes going on. Late 19th century to early 20th century is an arbitrary time-frame of particularity interest, purely because I happened to read about Meiji’s nation-building project. So that’s somewhere between Tokugawa and Meiji, and in Korea would be Joseon and Korean Empire?

Not really familiar with them, but scripts used in Japan I know of were Kabun, Hentaigana and Man’yogana, and Korea were Hanmun, Hyangchal, Idu, Gugyeol (and maybe some more). I believe with Man’yogana and Hyangchal, you’re basically trying to manipulate Chinese Characters to reflect the phonetic sounds of the local vernacular. Although not sure how comparative they were to each other in terms of the ways in which Chinese may have been mixed with Japanese/Korean.

I’ve looked at the situation in Meiji-era Japan and the whole nation-building project at that time, in really pushing Japanese nationalism and becoming a modern (at that time, that was to say, to be Western) colonial power. One slogan which stuck in my head was the ‘Leave Asia, Enter Europe’ 脱亜入欧（だつあにゅうおう）. I'm more familiar with the political general nation-building and the intellectual movement from Fukuzawa Yukichi, etc. aspects of it, but I can only (perhaps wrongly) assume a speed-up of trying to make a unique national language. Especially when Japan ends up beating China in the Sino-Japanese War(s). I have no clue if the political climates would have had any influence on the linguistic aspect of things. There were probably some script reforms in line with this ideology if I had to guess.

Not sure what kind of intellectual movements occurred in Korea which could have influence a Korean nationalism(?) and the evolution of there written languages. There was this guy Yu Kil-chun who came to Meiji Japan and studied under Fukuzawa Yukichi, who would have brought home the same sort of modernization ideals? Not sure if this translated linguistically at all… As in, a Korean nationalist movement to make the language more “Korean”?

linguistics,Danish loss of consonants?,"So Danish is generally seen as sounding pretty weird when compared to the other Norse languages because of the Soft D combined with the guttural R (uvular fricative) and stød.

linguistics,Numbers beyond ten naming convention,"Hello All,

Numbers beyond ten (teens) tend to have distinctive names till certain point beyond which they morph the naming convention to something resembling `x-teen`, where x is the digit name. What is interesting is how aforementioned point floats depending on a language. Here is a handful of examples:

## English

numbers: eleven (11), twelve (12), thirteen (13) ...

switch point: 12/13

## German

numbers: elf (11), zwölf (12), dreizehn (13) ...

switch point: 12/13

## French/France

numbers: onze (11), douze (12), treize (13), quatorze (14), cinq ans (15), seize (16), dix-sept (17), dix-huit (18), dix-neuf (19)

switch point: 16/17

## Russian

numbers: одиннадцать (11), двенадцать (12), тринадцать (13)

switch point: 10/11

## Polish

numbers: jedenaście (11), dwanaście (12), trzynaście (13)

switch point: 10/11

## Edge Case

There is also an edge case I found:

## French/Switzerland

French speaking Swiss are taught an `x-teen` sort of pattern for numbers within `11-20` range. It would be nice to get a French speaking Swiss to verify that information, as I think I read it long time ago in the Internet, but I am not able to provide any source atm. I suspect Swiss did some language smoothing/reform on a gov level at some point, which did not happen in France.

## Questions

1. How does the situation look like in your native language(s)? Does the switch point also fluctuate? Please share your examples and if possible use format below for clarity:
2. Does this phenomena have any name perhaps?
3. In case there is any research about that I would highly appreciate, if you could drop a link to the paper.
4. I have no idea how this phenomena behaves across languages spoken in Africa, Middle East and Far East. Hence, I would highly appreciate any examples from those regions, too.

## Hypothesis

My working hypothesis is that various countries across times were using specific mathematical base systems. For example we use 10th base system nowadays across the world. However, there are still some remainings of other names for what ""used to be an important number"" like:

* English: dozen (12)
* Polish: tuzin (12), mendel (15), kopa (60)

linguistics,Japanese is an amazing language. Hear me out.,"I mainly want to praise about sentence structure but I'll touch on other parts of the language too. Feel free to skip the other paragraphs.

**Writing system**.  
Kanji + Kana notation is an interesting take on writing, compared to more alphabetical languages. I haven't learned (or read) enough Kanji for my opinion to matter, but apparently its faster to skim through Kanji because the symbols looks visually distinct. But that might just be because Kana is a mostly faithful phonetic alphabet, so its harder to make different visual shapes. Though it won't be hard to adapt to a fully phonetic one like romaji with spaces. You can pick up the argument in the comment section.

**Phonetics.**  
Japanese has 5 simple vowels.  
Most sounds are easy to make too. ""ts"" as in tsunami or pantsu sound is easy to learn. Japanese liquid ""r"" is trickier, but not hard at all once you know the correct tongue movement. It can sound both like English ""r"" or ""l"". Some ""combined"" sounds are tricky but are rarely used. 

As a result, Japanese is a very fast language. Thus, of course, it must add spice. It has a ""n"" sound that has no vowel but still last a mora (a unit of equal length time taken by each vowel), that can change to m or /ŋ/ depending on what comes after. It also has something similar to pauses or ""long consonants"" that can be pretty fun.

**Grammar. (the star of the show)**

Sentences can be very simple. Sentences can vary a lot in structure and still make sense. Sentences can sound TOO simple compared to other languages, yet still get the same message across. Some phrases can be particularly lovely. Let's start with adjectives.

suki suki. suki is an adjective roughly meaning ""liked-by"". Where's the subject and the object? Gone, reduced to atoms. This is brilliant. These things can be implied. It can cause misunderstandings and that's absolutely okay.

You can ask ""nani ga?"" to clarify what is being liked. Longer sentence. ""kimi ga suki"". ""kimi"" is one of the terms for ""you"". There's still no subject. It's still implied. And it can cause misunderstandings.

Next up, ""nani nani"". You can guess nani roughly means ""what"". We haven't used proper question qualifier particles. We don't need to. It's FANTASTIC.

Finally, verbs and sentence structure. Japanese verbs steal the spotlight of the show. More accurately, it showcases the best part of the language, which is the ability to turn words into words. Nouns can become verbs. Verbs can become adjectives. Adjective can become nouns. All without being wordy. Very naturally. This idea is further solidified by Japanese ""-ending"" rules or ""conjugations"". A verb can become an adjective. if ""miru"" is ""look/see"", then mitai is ""want, miru"". It's now an adjective. What? Adjectives have past tenses you say? That's right. The lines are blurry and easy to cross. This way, Japanese words are less distinct in each form like in English are far more flowing. This makes it easy to express complex descriptive ideas very naturally. And negating things are super simple too. Made possible by Head Final ordering, which I absolutely love.

Bonus. Nuances. Japanese language makes it possible for everything to be nuanced. To me, this means there are more layers than what's on the surface that I can imply. More implications. More nuances. A lot of different nouns (and pronouns) that can range from entirely different areas of usage, or polite forms, or gendered (as in used by one gender more), or social status, or social group, respect level, formality, closeness. I love rich languages like this where language allows me to express these nuances. This is very subjective and dependent on your culture on how you view this though.

Thanks for listening to my preach. If I haven't convinced you, or you'd like to poke counter questions, I have a lot of steam left. Discuss me anything. Anki is love. Anki is life.",1607702860,-DivineGod-,12
linguistics,Dummy auxiliary in SOV languages,"Many SOV languages of the larger ""Altaic"" linguistic area and somewhat beyond seem to have a very productive way of creating new verbs by combining a noun/adjective and a dummy auxiliary meaning ""to do / make"", e.g. Persian سفر کردن *safar kardan* ""to make travel"" meaning ""to travel"", Turkish *ikna etmek* ""to make persuasion"" = ""to persuade"", Korean 말하다 *mal-hada* ""to make speech"" = ""to speak"", Japanese 勉強する *benkyō suru* ""to make studying"" = ""to study"", Hindi शिकार करना *śikār karnā* ""to make hunting"" = ""to hunt"" etc. Quite often the first part of the compound seems to be a loanword from a non-SOV language such as Arabic or Chinese but sometimes native words and loans from other SOV languages seem to fit the same pattern, too.

So my question is: Why is this type of construction so prevalent in these languages? Is it contact-induced where each language family would have borrowed it directly from a neighboring group (so possibly an areal feature)? Are verbs a semi-closed class in these languages and if so, is it statistically related to the SOV word order? Or is there some inherent incompatibility between source language (Arabic/Chinese...) and target language (Persian/Turkish...) verbal morphology/syntax, which makes borrowing nouns much easier than borrowing verb roots?

Related to this, are similar constructions widespread in SOV languages in other geographical regions or in languages with another basic word order? All the SOV languages I'm personally familiar with are from this region (except for Mande and Songhay, which are typologically somewhat untypical being SAuxOV), so I would appreciate examples from elsewhere like East Africa, New Guinea or the Americas.",1607700975,nafoore,17

However the words before/after ostensibly seem to be reversed here, BeFORE and AFTer, in front of and behind. I noticed it's the same in Chinese as well.

Is this just a quirk of language change, or does this indicate that people have changed their conception of which direction time is moving?

linguistics,On the Usage of なそう and なさそう (adapted from Japanese),"**I came across** [**this Japanese paper**](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02910235/document) **by Akiko Takemura, Thomas Pellard, et al., and it was so interesting that I felt I had to share it... So here it is, condensed/adapted/paraphrased in English!**

# The -sō Form

When attaching to adjectives (here referring only to *i*\-adjectives) in Japanese, the *-sō* ""seems \~"" form usually attaches to the stem of the adjective:

* これは高**そう**だ。 *kore wa taka***sō** *da.*  ""This **seems expensive**.""
* 難し**そう**なぁ。 *muzukashi***sō** *naa.* ""(That) **seems** so **difficult**...""

There are two main exceptions in the adjectives 良い *ii\~yoi* ""good"" and 無い *nai* ""nonexistent,"" which have their own unique forms with *-sasō* instead (where the *-sa* is originally the nominalizing suffix):

* いいものが無**さそう**だ。 *ii mono ga na***sasō** *da.* ""It **seems that there isn't** anything good.""
* 性質は**良さそう**だ。 *seishitsu wa yo***sasō** *da.* ""(He) **seems good**\-natured.""

The one we're focusing on today is *na-i*.

# The Negative Affixes

Adjectives are made negative by appending *na-i* to the adverbial form in *-ku* to make *-ku na-i*, whereas verbs are made negative by appending *-(a)na-i* to the verb stem:

* 高い *taka-i* ""tall, expensive"" → 高**くない** *taka***ku na-i** ""not tall, not expensive""
* 行く *ik-u* ""goes"" → 行**かない** *ik***ana-i** ""doesn't go""
* 食べる *tabe-ru* ""eats"" → 食べ**ない** *tabe***na-i** ""doesn't eat""

# Irregularities with Mixing the Two

Irregularities start to arise, however, due to the fact that the negative affixes are etymologically derived from 無い *na-i* ""nonexistent"" and also inflect as adjectives. The question is, then: when adding *-sō* to these negative forms, do they take the regular *-sō* or the extended *-sasō*?

For adjectives, it turns out that essentially everyone uses *-sasō* and never *-sō*. This makes some sense, since the ""suffix"" *-ku na-i* is actually separable (hence why I've written it with a space), e.g. 高くもない *takaku mo nai* ""nor is it tall,"" so it seems that at least on some level, this *na-i* is still readily identifiable with 無い *na-i*. For example:

* これはあまり高**くなさそう**だ。 *kore wa amari* taka**ku nasasō** *da.* ""This **doesn't seem** particularly **expensive**.""

However, for negative verbs, people are more divided. The highly-regarded dictionary 日本国語大辞典 *Nihon Kokugo Daijiten* ""Great Dictionary of Japanese"" states that it is normal for the verb ending *-(a)nai* to become *-(a)nasō*, that is, using *-sō* and not *-nasasō*. But contrary to what the dictionary says is ""normal,"" the truth is that both of the following sound natural, and their meaning is identical:

* 今日はそこに行**かなそう**だ。 *kyō wa soko ni ik***anasō** *da.* ""It **seems that** (he) **won't go** there today.""
* 今日はそこに行**かなさそう**だ。 *kyō wa soko ni ik***anasasō** *da.* ""It **seems that** (he) **won't go** there today.""

There is a similar disagreement regarding adding *-sō* to adjectives which etymologically originate from negative verbs, such as つまらない *tsumar***ana-i** ""boring, trivial"" (from 詰まる *tsumar-u*) or 物足りない *monotari***na-i** ""unsatisfactory, insufficient"" (from 足りる *tari-ru*).

# Data

[Takemura Akiko, Thomas Pellard, et al.](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02910235/document) searched through four corpuses of text for examples to quantify how often *-nasō* and *-nasasō* are used.

* 現代日本語書き言葉コーパス(通常版) / ""Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese""
* 日本語歴史コーパス / ""The Corpus of Historical Japanese""
* 名大会話コーパス / ""The Meitai Conversational Corpus""
* 日本語話し言葉コーパス / ""The Corpus of Spoken Japanese""

And their results were:

||with *-sō*|with *-sasō*|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Verb + *-(a)na-i*|82|123|205|
|Adjective + *-ku na-i*|11|1666|1677|
|*sumana-i* ""inexcusable""|50|15|65|
|*tsumarana-i* ""boring""|79|15|94|
|*monotarina-i* ""unsatisfactory""|2|7|9|
|*kudarana-i* ""worthless""|1|0|1|
|*udatsu-no-agarana-i* ""lacking potential for career advancement""|0|1|1|

It should be noted that 10 of the 11 examples of adjectives with *-ku nasō* came from the of Historical Japanese corpus (with 71 examples of *-ku nasasō*), and the single other example came from the Contemporary Written Japanese corpus (which had 1535 examples of *-ku nasasō*) and could very well have been a one-off mistake. Therefore, we can probably conclude that *-ku nasō* is essentially unused in contemporary Standard Japanese.

On the other hand, as stated earlier, negative verbs are split between *-sasō* and *-sō*, and the quantitative data shows about a 60-40 lean towards -*sasō.* Verb-derived-adjectives are similarly divided, but with an apparent lean towards *-sō*, at least for *sumana-i* and *tsumarana-i*.

Wouldn't a language that can only be analysed diachronically mean that native speakers somehow have to memorise every form of every word in the language?
Considering that the language is also polysynthetic, that would mean that these forms would be potentially infinite.
The only other mechanism by which such a language could work is if the speakers still somehow retained a representation of the grammar of an older stage of the language to which they then applied the sound changes required to get to the modern stage.

For the majority of my L2 acquisition, I had been unaware that these sounds existed. Due to lack of them in my L1, which I'm sure is the case for many of you, I chose to pronounce &lt;th&gt; with the next best thing, which are the labiodental-fricatives. My incorrect pronunciation has never hurt me as much when speaking with my peers and other non-natives as everyone had seemed to have the same idea of the way these sounds should be produced. No one chose to correct my mispronunciation during the learning process as well, likely due to the fact that most teachers were also unaware of said phonemes.

Ever since I have moved to Britain, however, I could not help but notice all of native speakers producing dental-fricatives sounds instead. At one point, I had obviously learned about the mistake I've been making for all this time and shifted towards the correct /ð/ and /θ/. However, what seems particularly interesting to me is how I failed to notice either of these phonemes in my consumption of American media. 

Indeed, it had never occurred to me that /f/and /v/ are incorrect as both had been what I always heard in American movies, games etc. in place of aforementioned sounds. I had done my small research on this matter and it seems to me that /ð/ and /θ/ are universally accepted in British and American English alike, despite my doubts in this matter.

It truly fascinates me that I fail to acknowledge this despite being reassured by several sources upon a quick Google search. Therefore, I'm dying to hear your piece on this. What is the reality of common pronunciation of &lt;th&gt; in North America? Are my doubts at all justified or am I simply chasing ghosts and justifying my own ignorance?

linguistics,How accurate is my understanding of “what counts as a dialect”?,"Being multilingual can result in a variety of cross-over phenomena. Your skills in one language can get rusty, one language can influence the other, you may only become fully fluent in one language but not others. Languages with these incidental features take a number of forms: a second language with first language interference and incomplete acquisition is called an “interlanguage” or a “learner language,” a first language that isn’t fully acquired or is influenced by a second language or attrition is called a “heritage language.”

Due to the incidental and individual nature of these phenomena, these language varieties are generally kept distinct from “dialects.” However, when should these varieties actually be called dialects? After all, many “dialects” are heritage languages, and many originated as interlanguages.

Naomi Nagy points this out in [their essay](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=fdi7CgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=heritage+language+nagy+dialects&amp;ots=5nJuTJvqTB&amp;sig=Odx3lFVgMrXkKRAqo50YMlchj3I#v=onepage&amp;q=heritage%20language%20nagy%20dialects&amp;f=false) on the dialectal nature of heritage languages, that we don’t know what a dialect really is. Definitions vary between scholars, and many definitions are exclude a large number of dialects. Nagy’s solution is to reference [Schneider's Dynamic Model](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schneider%27s_dynamic_model), and suggests that attitudinal features of emerging New Dialects, such as a variety having a name, and people identifying as speakers, and being named in literature, help mark it as a dialect. Nagy is not the only person to do this; debates on the status of [Hong Kong English](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_English#Status) has also relied on this model, and [debates about Philippine English](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13488678.2016.1223067) in this model are ongoing.

If this is true dialects can be distinguished from learner and (mere) heritage varieties not by demographics or linguistic features, but by community perception. If a language is a dialect with an army and a navy, for varieties that emerge from language contact, a dialect is a shifted variety with cultural recognition.",1607458053,Hermoine_Krafta,1

linguistics,Are there any research/studies done on basic word order (SOV SVO VSO etc) in the context of neural load/processing capacity.,"Growing up learning SVOs as a mother tongue kinda biased me into SVO-*probably*-most-reasonable faction but i'd like to see some data/science done on this.

SVO appears to be extremely primitive, in the sense that if one were imagine a prehistoric human hunting a mammoth, the word order ""i spear mammoth"" would appear exactly as it would be drawn as a mural, with the spear being in between the subject I, and the object mammoth. 

SOV seems bit strange since, by its order, you'd put the object in some neural RAM(nRAM), then upon the completion of the sentence with the verb, extract the object back from nRAM for reconstruction. If SOV how did it evolve to become the most common order? I can't think of some rationalization that someone would impromptu come up with this. Additionally, what benefits would there be for an order like this; can't be the dominant order on the planet relying just on luck.

VSO is even weirder, but at least i can somewhat rationalize it; By placing the verb first, one may first convey the general idea of the sentence, then details. Again imagine a hunter who wishes to convey his plans of cornering prey during a hunt, placing the verb first may jolt the listener of his subconscious memory into recalling hunting techniques and concepts, thus reducing neural load interpreting minor details. 

The less common orders i know relatively little about so i can't talk much about them.

There seems to be quite objective differences between these word orders but when laymen speak about their languages, these are mere ""quirks"" that are, like young me thought, just a matter of course. 

Back to the point, my thoughts aren't scientific nor well thought-out so i'd like to see some expert talk about it, see what actual benefits are there or they're really just a matter of taste as speakers of various languages seem to consider.",1607447228,aortm,1

1. Recording 12-sec wav files. Recording is always on, but the player can pause it.

2. Within these wav files the user marks the start and the end of the spoken phrase while clicking on the button symbolizing the object. Each phrase is in a specific pattern about a specific object.

3. There are 10 objects, 10 phrase patterns, and one general question on the first level of the game. This level is named “Pointing quiz”.

4. There are four kinds of phrase patterns in this level. One pattern for an object’s name, three patterns for questions, three patterns for suitable answers to these questions, and three patterns for commands. All patterns include the object’s name.

5. While gathering data each phrase is marked: name of wav file containing the phrase, start time of the phrase within the file, end time of the phrase within the file, object ID and pattern ID.

6. Features are extracted from the marked phrases using the Essentia library.

7. Extracted features are arranged in normalized array.

8. Each array for each object and each pattern is labeled.

9. These arrays and their labels are saved in txt files for training and testing separately. This will be used as a dataset for machine learning, and this dataset starts from scratch for each language.

10. Convert the data from text files to Numpy npz files.

11. Use TensorFlow to create protobuf files from collected data.

Earlier I had a couple of really good programs from the UK (Edinburgh, Glasgow) on my list but they have only one-year programs (I don’t think that’ll be sufficient time to get develop a good enough understanding plus they are pretty expensive given the duration). Most programs in the US that I found are too “core” and have some prerequisites which I don’t seem to fulfill.

By 1200, In the modern day, only Welsh, Icelandic, and most varieties of English retain these sounds.

My question is whether the emergence and prompt disappearance of these sounds in all of these languages fairly simultaneously was related? Obviously the Germanic languages had dental fricatives due to Grimm's Law and lost them due in the most part because of the High German consonant shift. It could probably be handwaved that Old French gained them due to Germanic influence and lost them as part of widespread lenition. But that doesn't quite explain 

a) Why the Celtic languages developed and lost them, given that they are very much not SAE?

b) Why English and Welsh both retained them? 

c) Why the North Germanic languages mostly lost them?

linguistics,5 SIGNS THAT YOUR KIDNEYS ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY AS IT MUST BE," 

# 5 SIGNS THAT YOUR KIDNEYS ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY AS IT MUST BE

Our Kidneys have a central part of our own life. It eliminates waste products and extra fluid out of our bodies. The Kidneys are responsible for generating numerous hormones; these hormones aid in creating red blood cells and another hormone, which is accountable for coordinating blood pressure and maintaining metabolism.

*We should be sure that our Kidneys work in the right way because we will suffer from enormous health risks if they don't. There are ten signs which show that our Kidneys do not work well, and these signs are:*

**1-When, we face troubles while we are sleeping:**

If our Kidneys do not work in the right way, the toxins in our bodies cannot exit through the urine, and it will remain inside the blood. The increasing number of toxins in the body will lead to trouble sleeping, which may be a sign of chronic kidney disease.

Cautioning: whenever your doctor diagnosed you with chronic kidney disease, you may suffer from sleep apnea and might be signs of migraine pain. You may ask yourself exactly what the significance of sleep apnea is? Sleep apnea means you'll suffer from a sleeping disorder, which contributes to a couple of fractures of breathing through sleeping/mesothelioma symptoms. 

This can continue anywhere in the minutes to over one minute. We'll consider this situation dangerous and the need for a doctor to view it instantly.

**2-Headaches, weariness, and general weariness:**

Healthy and properly functioning kidneys convert Vitamin D in our bodies to maintain healthy bones and to produce a hormone called Erythropoietin (EPO). This hormone plays an essential role in the production of red blood cells. When kidneys don't function properly, they produce less EPO. The decline of red blood cells (those that carry oxygen/mesothelioma prognosis) results in rapid fatigue of your muscles and brain.

**Warning:** It's typical for individuals with Chronic Kidney Infection to get anemia. Anemia may develop when somebody has 20% to 50 percent of normal kidney function. If you are getting adequate sleep and rest but keep experiencing feelings of fatigue, low energy levels, and overall weakness, drop by your physician.... **open to read more**

linguistics,Morphologically accurate description on Japanese verbs?,"TL;DR This has bothered me for a long time. I know a fair share of Japanese, but I'm looking for a clear, morphologically accurate description of the verb system in Japanese (not the ichidan/godan with 5 different stems per verb depending on the use).

I think I've seen a post about that some time ago here but I can't find it anymore.

\-----------  
I'm a self-taught Japanese speaker with intermediate level. Learning that language was one of the reasons I got so interested in linguistics and I made it my major throughout university.  
I naturally started having doubts regarding the consistency of the traditional explanations of Japanese verb groups and stems, because for me it was circling around the actual system of suffixes without ever going into it.

Time has passed, I've been spending a lot less time on studying Japanese, and now my sister started Japanese Language and Literature studies at university. She often talks to me about her lessons when she needs further explanations, especially on grammar. Now, I often find my analysis of it to be different from what they are being taught (godan/ichidan, multiple verb stems for different uses...) and I'm like ""why do they not learn them as stems with consonant endings and suffixes, and factorise all that mess a bit?""  
I believe the kana system also doesn't help, for example, to see yomu/yomanai/yomimashou as yom- + suffix layers, instead of yomu/yoma- +nai/yomi- +mashou.

  
So I'd like it if somebody were able to clearly explain how the system works, and maybe what the earlier forms were, to understand why ichidan exists, and where all the actual suffixes come from.  
If you find the post where this had been discussed, it would also be awesome :)  


Thanks in advance for your help!",1607344678,kauraneden,23

linguistics,Re-introduction of voiced dental fricative in Old English?,"I'm a bit confused about the following:

"" The Proto-Germanic voiced dental fricative \[ð\], which was an allophone of /d/ in certain positions, became a plosive \[d\] in all positions throughout the West Germanic languages. Thus, it affected High German, Low German, Dutch, Frisian and Old English alike. It did not spread to Old Norse, which retained the original fricative. Because of its much wider spread, it must have occurred very early, during[ Northwest Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Germanic) times, perhaps around the 2nd century.

English has partially reversed this shift through the change /dər/ &gt; /ðər/, for example in *father*, *mother*, *gather* and *together*.""

linguistics,Partitive possessives,"Native English speakers, I wish to get your opinion on the meanings of partitive possessive determiners. Suppose there is a group of children and a man named Rob. I wish to express the notion that Rob is the father of one of these children. I could say ""Rob is the father of one of them"" (*one of them* being a partitive phrase). That's all well and good. But English, as you know, is equipped with possessive determiners (*my*, *your*, *Phil's*). And the phrase denoting the possessor can be of arbitrary complexity (*no child's*, *John and Mary's*, *the dog I ran away from's*). The question is therefore, how would you express the aforementioned idea while making use of a possessive determiner? I have three options below, but if you can think of another, please do let me know.

* *Rob is one of their fathers.*
* *Rob is one of their father.*
* *Rob is one of them's father.*

Of course, I have my own opinions about which I consider grammatical and what each means (if anything at all). I am keen to know what others think. Thank you in advance.

linguistics,"Grammatical gender of ""agua"" in Spanish?","Spanish is my L2. I encountered this today, although it may be as new to some of you as it was to me.

In Spanish, most words that end in -a are feminine, and most words that end in -o are masculine.  There are a few notable exceptions, such as:

* La mano (the hand)
* El mapa (the map)
* El problema (the problem)
* El agua (the water)
* El aguila (the eagle)

Spanish also has grammatical agreement between subject and adjective, and these words follow the same rules as any other word in the language:

* La mano negra (the black hand)
* El mapa plano (the flat map)
* El problema claro (the clear problem)

However, these two do not:

linguistics,Brackets and slashes in IPA,"Lately I've been seeing many people use brackets and slashes kinda irregularly, almost interchangeably. If I'm not mistaken, only phonemes may be put between slashes. If the transcription contains actual phones, then brackets are used.

However, I encountered a different definition. 'Slashes are used for ""broad"" transcription, whereas brackets are used for ""narrow"" transcription.' This definition contradicts the first definition as it obscures the difference in use of slashes and brackets. This way the use of either brackets or slashes seems more like a ""personal preference"".

For example, 'head' is transcribed as /hɛd/, and 'ahead' is transcribed as /əˈɦɛd/ instead of /əˈhɛd/. As far as I know, both [ɦ] and [h] are allophones of a single phoneme /h/ in English but the transcription suggests otherwise.

Neighbouring the Germanics for over a millennium (I'm a native Polish speaker, with some knowledge of Russian and Serbo-Croatian) it seems unexplainable to me, how in the world - comparing word roots - it's easier to me to understand Sanskrit than our neighbour's words. And the similarities are not slight. They are very clear, 1:1 in some cases. It makes the Balto-Slavic/Sankrit peoples' split seem like a recent event (compared to the speech similarities Slavic languages share with Germanic ones).

linguistics,How artificial is the German case system (or grammar for that matter)?,"To clarify, when the Dutch language was codified around the 16th century the 4 case system was already much on the decline, but was implemented regardless. This was artificially kept up even until the beginning of the 20th century (especially artificial was the masculine accusative article 'den'). 

I also read that around the time Luther translated the bible into German, the genitive was already on the decline there and he used a rather conservative grammar all around. So I wonder what part of German grammar and especially the case system has more or less been reintroduced/artificially maintained?

On a side note: I think but I'm not certain that the case system has disappeared entirely in low German (makes sense, since low German is very related to Dutch).

(I think the listener was Chinese.)

I asked this question on r/asklinguistics and received an answer:
&gt; It's really because the 't' is unaspirated following /s/, and the same applies to the affricate. On top of that, the ""voiced"" cognates /d/ and /d͡ʒ/ are usually pronounced de-/un- voiced word-initially in many dialects. The sounds written &lt;t&gt;, &lt;d&gt;, &lt;ch&gt;, &lt;zh&gt;, &lt;q&gt;, and &lt;j&gt; in Pinyin have a similar thing going on in Mandarin: the distinction is primarily one of aspiration.

However, I don't fully understand it.

linguistics,parapraxis vs unintentional double entendres,"**TL;DR** Do we have a term (linguistic, stylistic, psychological) for a person who has ongoing unintentional double entendres that reveal repressed feelings? (Where it seems like the unconscious mind has hacked the conscious speaker, and the speaker is unaware.)

*\*Due to the topic there is some light sexual/untoward material below, but I have a serious question please.*

David Cross, in Arrested Development, has perfected a character (Tobias Funke) who is a black belt at putting his foot in his mouth, but not understanding that he has done so. He says blatantly ""that's what she said"" double entendres without ever realizing the double meaning. This causes great awkwardness for the other characters who clearly are unsettled by his choice of words. Of course it's meant to be amusing for the viewer. 

For example, here are a couple of his ""worst"" unintentional double entendres:

\[*After painting himself blue to try out for the Blue Man Group, explaining why he can't participate in an event*\] “I’m afraid I just blue myself.” 

\[*Expressing his enthusiasm to be a friend's wingman at a bar.*\] “Even if I have to take a chubby, I’m willing to suck it up!”

\[*Talking to his brother in law.*\] “Michael, you are quite the cupid. You can zing an arrow in my buttocks any time.”

\------------------------------------------------------------------

A Freudian slip is when the speaker is surprised by the error also, like when you accidently call your husband by your ex-husband's name. 

And double entendres are intentional usually, used when the speaker wants to speak in a sort of playful code to someone she is sure will understand the gist. 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

But what about those double entendre examples I found which seem to be unintentional ""that's what she said"" moments written into TV programs in order to elicit giggles (from [this website](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/double-entendre-examples.html):)

\[*In an episode of The Simpsons, when Marge was about to board a ship to Skull Island, Smithers said\]* 'I think women and seamen don't mix.""

\[*In another episode of the Simpson's, gold is discovered in the river and Kent Brockman says\]* ""Thanks, Mayor Simpson! From now on, we'll all be taking golden showers.""

\[*In Finding Nemo, the characters are told\]* ""Ok, everyone, think dirty thoughts!""

These all seem unintentional; they seem unrealized by the speaker. What is the technical term for this?

linguistics,Is there a name for this human-made trumpet sound?,"The original title of my post is “Can anyone else make a trumpet sound?”

I recently posted this question on another sub, but I haven’t really gotten more information about this or even a name for what other people call this. So I may be stretching it by posting here, but I really wasn’t sure where to post. Let me know if this may be more appropriate in another sub.

I’m not sure how to explain this, but I can make a trumpet-like sound with my mouth. I’ve mentioned it to some friends and most of them are confused on what I mean or simply don’t know what to expect, then they ask me to do it and I do and they say they’ve never seen someone do that.

I’ve tried looking it up online but I’m not even sure how to search for this kind of thing “human trumpet sound?”

So here I am. 

I’m not sure how to describe it but basically I can make the sound of a trumpet with my mouth. It’s a bit like a whistle except that it also uses my vocal chords. The air that comes out of my mouth when whistling is slower than when I make this trumpet sound. I can play different “notes” with it like if I were singing. I have enough control over it to hit specific notes “on demand” and even “sing” (toot?) songs from memory. The lower I go with the notes, eventually I hit a note where I can no longer produce the trumpet sound and it’s just me singing a low note. I assume this has something to do with my voice.

It’s quite loud, louder than a whistle.

This probably seems really weird to most people but I’ve been able to do this for as long as I can remember and I’ve always wondered if it has a name or if anyone else can do it too. 

While I’m on this sub... Does anyone knows of a natural or constructed language that uses these sounds?

There’s a Reddit page on almost everything, but I’m not sure what this would even be called or if anyone else out there can do this, but I assume there must be *someone* who knows what I’m talking about. Anyway, thanks for reading!",1606848333,CubesandSpheres,4

This means that not only the people speak several languages, but it's also possible to do that in governmental offices.

I remember the island of Flores (Indonesia) - most people still speak their local languages. But from my information governmental forms are in Bahasa always. The situation in West Java (Batawi/Sundanese/Javanese) is similar.

The first examples were South Tyrol, but from my own experience the tension between Italians and Tyroleans are still present and according to my knowledge you can't obtain a mobile phone contract in South Tyrol in Italian. The conductors by Trenitalia often don't speak a single word German. 

In Carinthia there isn't a single Slovenian native who can't speak German, on the other side most German speakers barely understand Slovenian.

In Central Asia it was in my opinion truly bilingual in the 90s as most people still spoke Russian from their time at school but already many Russians were able to speak Uzbek or Kazakh.   
Nowadays the Turk population have a pretty bad Russian and the Russians consider the Turk languages as somewhat lower-class.

My guesses were:

* Northern India (as most languages there are related to Hindi)
* Papua-New Guinea as due to their many languages in each stage of school the student's are required to study a new language
* Timor Leste as the legislative is from my knowledge still mostly Portuguese, despite Tetum being the official language. Due to the Indonesian occupation everything related to trade is still in Bahasa and won't probably change for a while. Even the currency on the street is often IDR

linguistics,A question about Sino-Vietnamese readings and sound changes from fricative /s/ into stop /t/,"I was looking at some modern Vietnamese vocabulary and noticed that Middle Chinese /s/ was borrowed into Vietnamese as /t/ based on a few examples (i.e. 算学 suan4 xue3 as toán học, 心 xin1 as    tâm or tim). As a speaker of modern Korean, Japanese, and Mandarin, I found it incredibly curious that of the Sino-Xenic pronunciations, only Vietnamese used /t/ as an approximation for /s/. This led to a number of questions about borrowed words that I would like to learn more about:

1. According to Wikipedia, a number of different initials in Middle Chinese were consolidated into /t/ including /dz/ /s/ /z/ /ts/. Of these, /dz/ and /ts/ make sense to me, and maybe even /z/, but I don't see why /s/ wouldn't be realized as ʂ or ɕ. Apparently Proto-Viet-Muong saw systematic change from /s/ to modern /t/. Is there a name for this type of sound change?
2. Are there any examples of languages that borrowed a fricative like /s/ into a stop like /t/? A remotely similar phenomenon I can think of is the pronunciation of /s/ as a stop in modern Korean in a final position. However, this is not a Sino-Xenic borrowing as Middle Korean adopted /l/ for Middle Chinese /t/ (though it kept /s/) and from my understanding is a fundamentally different phenomenon than what might occur phonotactically when /s/ is an initial.
3. Modern Vietnamese has /s/ (i.e. xinh) but this didn't exist in Proto-Viet-Muong or Middle Vietnamese. When did /s/ develop in modern Vietnamese?",1606780466,Kylaran,10

What the fuck? Why do they do this? There's definitely a Hindi word for ""book"", and there's definitely a Hindi word for ""suggest"". So it's not like these words don't exist in their language so they have to use the English. So why are they using the English? Why is every single sentence spoken in Hindi, or really any Indian language, peppered with English words as half or nearly half of every sentence? Does ANYONE speak these languages in their ""pure"" form using only their native words and not peppering every single sentence with a bunch of English?

And if you're going to say ""something something colonialism that's why this happened"" yeah, I'm aware. But you know what? Lots of countries were colonized by other countries in the past, and THEIR languages didn't turn into English-peppered gibberish. So why have Indian languages?",1606770040,uwwgs,5
linguistics,Andalusian Arabic - any way to learn this? Any resources? Any speakers still around in North Africa or even as L2 who’ve revived the language?,"I am very interested in learning this dialect/language of Andalusi Arabic.

There’s still villagers in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia who are bonafide descendants of Muslim refugees of al-Andalus and they live separately from the locals. Do they still maintain their Andalusi dialect?

linguistics,"I pronounce ""-ng"" and ""-ing"" words with a /ŋg/ sound. Is it regional dialect or just me?","Hi there, linguists! Just dropping in to ask about something I've only just recently clocked.

Background: I co-produce and do a fair bit of performing on a Canadian horror anthology podcast called ""Wrong Station."" Over the last few months we've gotten a few reviews (a very small percent) on iTunes that have made reference to how I seem to pronounce ""-ing"" words ""a hard g,"" or as ""ink."" Usually with a very negative connotation.

Now, I don't really care about that whatsoever; it's how I speak, plain and simple. But now I've noticed it, done a little research on it, and have become quite curious. Because everything I've read suggests it's a regional dialect trait of North And Mid- England. Whereas I am from Toronto, Ontario, and have lived here my whole life.

English is my only language. I have immigrant parents (Italian and Portuguese), but they both immigrated at a young age, speak ""typical"" Canadian English, and there was only English in the house when I was growing up.

Is this a peculiarity of my Canadian dialect, or simply an anomalous verbal tick on my part? Very curious!",1606765053,AJVBotelho,5

linguistics,"Is there a ""the quick brown fox jumped..."" but for speech? Capturing all the phonemes of English?","So, if you aren't familiar, typography examples typically use the sentence ""the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"" for a sentence because it uses every letter of the english alphabet. It's an easy way to capture all of the letters in a readable manner for comparison.

I'm wondering if this sort of thing exists for speech? Many of the phonetic studies I read look at specific types of morphemes/phonemes (fricatives, sibilants, rounded vowels, etc) so they can use prompts targetting just these phonemes (/u_u/, /o_o/, /a_a/, etc.) But I'm wondering if you just wanted to capture someones full phonetic profile, if theres a way to go about it that is relatively simplistic.

I'm interested in language, particularly how/if peoples phonetic profile changes after periods of time after moving geographic regions. This is something that is just kind of sitting in my head and I've just been wondering how it would work logistically. Obviously it could just be done by giving a bunch of word prompts, or just having them talk with a friend (I've seen this a number of times), but it seems having some static prompt that could be used for every morpheme/phoneme would be way more convenient.

Our weekly Q&amp;A thread is the perfect place to post them! A new Q&amp;A thread goes up every Monday, but we have people who read them regularly throughout the week.

**What counts as a “quick question”?**

Any question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate discussion all of the time, here are some examples: 

*Quick questions:*

* Asking for an explanation of a technical term
* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature
* Asking how we would transcribe something
* Asking how a feature works in a particular language

*Not-so-quick questions:*

* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

Also, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first.

linguistics,Is the idiom ‘ pardon the pun’ a misnomer ?,"Genuine question:

The phrase pardon the pun is used to indicate that you are intentionally making a pun. 

Another word for pardon is, ‘excuse’ or ‘forgive’. 

Why should we ‘excuse’ or ‘forgive’ a pun, when the pun was INTENTIONAL?

For example, we ask to be ‘forgiven’, when we make a mistake and ask for atonement etc. 

But in the case of the pun, the pun was INTENTIONAL and not a MISTAKE. 

Wouldn’t a better phrase be something along the lines of “ that was a terrible pun “ instead of “ pardon the pun “ ?

When referring to a person of unknown gender, in English it is common to use 'they/their/them' as an anaphor. Some example I picked from an article\*:

* ""I think someone left their laptop behind.""
* ""Who's in charge of that campaign? I'll email them.""

linguistics,"Is there a logic, reasoning or source behind the choice of the symbols and the transformations in the IPA vowel chart besides the few that appear at the surface?","In the IPA vowel chart, there are a few symbols that seem to follow the following patterns - 

(1) Letter changes that reflect the phonetic change (Open / Close) 

(2) A letter that reflects an existing usage in a (popular) European language.

Examples of (1) letter reflecting phonetics - The Epsilon (ɛ) symbol is also known as the ""open-e"", and on the chart it is located in towards the ""Open"" direction of the regular ""e"".

Similarly the letter (ɔ) the Open-mid back rounded vowel also known as the ""open-o"" is located towards the ""Open"" direction of the regular ""o"".

And the reverse Epsilon (ɜ) i.e. Open-mid central unrounded vowel is towards the open direction of the Schwa (ə) and can be considered an ""open Schwa"".

Is there similar reasoning behind some of the other transformations. E.g. the barred i (ɨ) &amp; u (ʉ), the capitalized I &amp; Y, the script A or the reversed &amp; upside down transformations?

i.e. in terms of denoting roundedness, back/front or open/closeness?

W.r.t. (2) an example is the use of y the Close front rounded vowel, which is the symbol used for this vowel in Danish, Norwegian and Swedish.

I'm not sure if the umlaut-a (ä) or the schwa have a basis in another language that has been repurposed within the IPA.

Also, why wouldn't this reasoning be better documented as it would help with the faster learning/recall of the IPA. Especially since it is so widespread now in dictionaries and pronunciation guides.

linguistics,"Native speakers of English, how easy it is for you to understand terminology in scientific and technical texts?","  

Today I asked an American friend of mine a question that I would like to address to you guys as well: is it hard for native English speakers to understand terminology borrowed from Latin?

Latin borrowings make up a huge part of the English language. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think about 2/3rds of the English lexicon are words of Latin origin. 

Which means, a scientific text isn't vastly different from regular speech - sure, the organization is strict and logical, the words have precise meanings, and abstract colloquial terms see no use, but the bulk of the terminology consists of widely used words which have simply been ""sharpened"" and stripped of vagueness.

So, since most of the kind redditors here probably have an experience of reading scientific literature, was it easy for you to grasp the meaning of the majority of terms? Or were many terms unclear, and you had to consciously remember what their definition was?

Being a native speaker of Russian, I kind of struggle to read serious studies and books made for professional linguists. There certainly are many widely used Latin borrowings in my language, and even though the meanings of word's root and other parts aren't readily understood, at least I know the concept associated with it and can infer the meaning. A good example would be the term ""speech compression"". I don't actively recall that ""to compress"" means ""to make smaller in size or volume"". Unlike in English, the most common verb to describe it isn't of Latin origin, and sounds completely different. However, I know that there's a machine called компрессор (compressor) which is used to squeeze air, and therefore, just by looking at this phrase, I can tell that speech compression means ""making the speech shorter"".

It would be a bit of an exaggeration to claim that one HAS to understand the word by looking at its parts. Of course, a lot can be deduced from the context, and even if I didn't know of such thing as a compressor, I would still likely be able to tell what this phrase meant by seeing it in use. However, terms and names comprised predominantly of Russian roots are infinitely easier to wrap your mind around.

A good example would be ""воздухозаборник"" (I'm sorry, beginner Russian learners, it's probably painful to read for you at this stage:D). Apart from the connecting vowel (о) and the suffix (ник), it's comprised of 2 key roots: воздух (air) and забор (derivative of забирать - to take in). Ник is a suffix with several meanings, but it's often used to indicate an object or a person that is doing a certain job. So, after looking at the word just once, I can immediately tell that воздухозаборник means a certain machine, the purpose of which is to pump the air in.

Is the similar process common when you're reading scientific or technical literature? Can you tell what most of the terms mean just by looking at them? Or do you need to keep in mind the definition and make conscious effort?

I'm sorry it took so long to explain, but I'm really curious whether the experience of reading books with plentiful terminological words is different for someone who uses loads of these words in their everyday speech and is pretty well-acquainted with the general concepts behind them. Because for me, it is often quite a struggle. If I didn't speak English and didn't know a little Latin, I'd probably be very lost.",1606580521,Neel_Yekk,89

linguistics,Need help from settling an argument with wife,"Need an outside perspective, ideally from someone trained in early childhood linguistics.

Basically, my wife doesn't want my mom to speak to our 3 year old son in Mandarin, as that is not her first language and she makes some grammatical/pronunciation errors. 

My mom speaks 95% of the time with my son in English, occasionally switching to Mandarin 5% of the time, as he speaks both. Some phrases/terms of endearment are more easily conveyed in Mandarin, as that is what he uses. 

My wife's view is that even this 5% of the time will irreparably damage his mandarin speaking skills. She has asked me to tell my mom to not speak mandarin with him. 

My mom, at the age of 65, has a hard time ""toeing the line"". Probably in the moment of affection, she forgets this rule I've given her. To be certain, she only speaks a few phrases here and there in mandarin, she isn't carrying long conversations in mandarin with him.

So my impression is, using this sentence as an example:

""We like talking about things""

""We like talkin about things"" (with a normal n linking with the a vowel)

linguistics,How does recursion in syntax affect how densely information can be encoded in language? What is the encoding efficiency of a language like Pirahã?,"I've been thinking about a finding published last year ([Coupe et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaw2594)) that supports the idea that information density is relatively stable across languages and even speakers within a language. The authors say that this is arises from a balance between Shannon information and speech rate.

This made me wonder about how efficiently information can be encoded in languages lacking recursive structures in their grammar, such as Pirahã. I understand that whether Pirahã lacks recursion is disputed in the first place. But I imagine most people would intuit that information density would decrease in any language that lacks recursion, because more syllables are required to convey the same information.

Does anyone know if Pirahã has a similar information rate as other languages? If so, is this accomplished by an increase in speech rate to compensate for decreased Shannon information? Is the syntax of Pirahã already optimized for the amount of information per syllable? Would 'forcing' a sentence in Pirahã to have more conventional recursive structures lower the information density?

linguistics,What is a writing system that uses 'letters' without phonetic correspondence?,"So, after doing a lot of reading about opcodes in machine language (i.e. compiled computer code), I got to thinking about how, in essence, as long as you have a syntax for a language, natural or not, the words are just mappings from one set to a set of meanings e.g. words in spoken language exist as a set of permutations of phonemes mapped to a set of meanings—likewise, words in written language exist as a set of permutations of graphemes (or as singular, unique graphemes in the case of logographic writing) mapped to a set of meanings.

This got me thinking about how a word spelled out still carries its meaning even if you don't know the sounds associated with the letters. I could know absolutely nothing of how some language is spoken, but so long as I know the meanings of different permutations of letters and the morphosyntactic rules that they operate under, I could still parse it to read and write.

What I'm unsure of is what a writing system that uses non-phonemic 'letters' (graphemes with no meaning other than to act as components of *a permutation with meaning*) would be thought of as.

I've created an example language written with four graphemes. These graphemes could be anything really, it's simply the permutations in which such graphemes occur that matters; for simplicity of representation, I will use the unicode of card suits:

♠       Hello  
♢♡♢     Goodbye  
♠♢      Please  
♣♣♠     Thank you

♡♢♡     I  
♢♠♡     You  
♣♠♡     He/She/They

The ♡ at the end of pronouns is inflected into a ♢ in the accusative case.

♢♠♠♣    to Know  
♡♢♡♣    to Greet  
♡♣      to Say

The ♣ end is inflected into a ♢♣ to indicate the past tense.

Then using an SOV structure, I could write stuff like:

♡♢♡ ♢♠♢ ♢♠♠♣    I know you  
♣♠♡ ♠ ♡♦♣       They said 'hello'  
♢♠♡ ♡♢♢ ♡♢♡♢♣   You greeted me

Presumably any language with such a writing system would have more than four graphemes so that words wouldn't end up extremely long, but the point remains. This is functionally a written language, the components of which lack any correspondence to a spoken language (technically the written language could even work entirely on its own without a spoken equivalent).

What I'm wondering what such a writing system would be it would be considered. It wouldn't be an alphabet, syllabary, abugida, or abjad because those systems each represent some phonetic element. It also wouldn't be a logographic system because the graphemes themselves are more like the letters of the previously mentioned systems in that they are simply components of words with no meaning of their own. I have no clue what such a thing would be viewed as.

P.S. If it seems like I'm repeating myself in different ways, you are probably right. This question is partially one of very abstract areas in linguistics like semiotics and parsing, so putting it into words is difficult; I'm trying to reiterate my point in a variety of ways to improve my chances of communicating the ideas.",1606339245,NoPreference6356,4

linguistics,"How do languages develop a palatal/velar distinction like in Slavic and Celtic, where nearly every consonant has a palatal and velar version?","I've tried reading up on the subject on my own but I feel like there are some major gaps in my knowledge.   

All I've figured out is that it has something to do with vowels that end up merging but leave traces of their features on the consonants. So something like you have a front vowel and a back vowel merging and but the adjacent consonants hold on to a +front or +back feature which manifests as palatalization or velarization.   

But then where did all these vowels come from? Modern Celtic and Slavic languages still have decently full vowel inventories, so are we assuming that they once had twice as many vowels? PIE definitely didn't have that many vowels so how did Celtic and Slavic develop so many pairs of front and back vowels?  

I can see something like /kø/ and /ko/ turning into /kʲo/ and /kˠo/ but then what were the precursor vowels to /kʲe/ and /kˠe/ in the same language?   

Also, vowels merge all the time but they usually don't produce a new distinctive feature among all the consonants in the language so what were the specific conditions that gave this result in Slavic and Celtic?

For context I’m a native Norwegian speaker, so I have /r/ with the main realization [ɾ], sometimes [r] (we also have an approximant realization or /r/, but I actually don’t pronounce that one, so I guess I do have a bit of trouble with rhotic sounds when speaking, too).

I also speak fluent Swedish with a Stockholm accent with /r/ typically realized as [ɹ], and this one I can “pronounce” in my head without moving my tongue, but I have to focus to do it. If I don’t focus, it “sounds” more like a soft glottal stop. When thinking in English (GA), /r/ typically sounds something like /j/. I speak French with, I think, a fairly decent accent for a non-native speaker, and as mentioned above, I can’t “think” /ʁ/, but I’m also not 100% sure I can say it out loud or if I’m overestimating my French skills.

linguistics,Californian accent?,"Hey, I'm from SoCal and yes, I saw SNL's californians skits. As obvious as this sounds, I can't tell if we have an accent or not, but maybe it's because it's out own accent. I'm not talking about the way we talk or our grammar or anything like that, but a more tangible ""accent"" if ya know what I'm saying. People from other states or countries, feel free to respond with your observations. 

What I have noticed about the way we talk:
- We talk fast
- We say ""like"" alot when we actually talk but over text or smth I feel like we don't as much 
- Yes, we do complain abt traffic
- We generally perceive ourselves to have a ""neutral"" accent (for example we can identify a new york accent or an accent from the south) 
- What I have observed is that the way we talk reflects our lifestyle, no it's not all surfing avo toast and starbucks but we're generally laid back and talkative. In some other states I think people are slightly more outgoing and will go more out of their way to talk to people. Southern Californians are generally friendly and will say hi here and there but convos with complete strangers doesn't happen that often.

linguistics,Question regarding metonymies and metaphors in car names,"First of all I'm pretty new to linguistics so i may get simple things wrong.

I am currently doing a mini-research on car names, specifically those from Volkswagen Group. I've collected the data and most of them are metonymies (like the usage of location names ex: Monte Carlo) and metaphors (like the usage of animal names ex: Beetle). 

I'm pretty confused, however. What main theory should i use to explain this? 

I tried to use Fellbaum's take on lexical relations, but she considers metonymy and metaphor as lexical relations but not really conceptual, which in my case both of them are conceptual, like the relation between VW Beetle and the real beetle bug (i guess this is a word sense?). Also, her theory suggests that metonymy is a part of polysemy, which contradicts other theories like Saeed for example.

Is this Jackendorf's conceptual semantics? Or Jakobson's metonymy and metaphor poles? Any suggestions?

linguistics,How are the sounds decided in the reconstruction of PIE?,"I have a general understanding of the reconstruction of proto languages with historical comparative linguistics, but there are some details I still don't understand. Hope someone can enlighten me.

Say, two child languages have some cognates. The pattern is clear that consonant A in one child language is correspondent to consonant B in the other child language. They must come from the same consonant from the proto language. The question is how can we decide the consonant of the proto language? There are several possibilities: 

1, the proto language has consonant A, and one child language changed it to B;

2, the proto language has B, and one child language changed it to A; 

3, the proto language has consonant cluster AB, and one child language lost A while the other lost B; 

4, the proto language has consonant C, and one child language changed it to A while the other changed it to B.

There are other possibilities but let's stop here with these straight forward ones. 

In what I've read about the reconstruction of Old Chinese, method three is actually very common. That's probably part of the reason why some people are strongly against it. For instance, if there is a third child language which has consonant C, do we conclude that the proto language has consonant cluster ABC? Sometimes the result cluster is so unnatural and even funny.

I'm sure in the reconstruction of PIE researchers don't just pile the consonants together to form consonant clusters. So what actually do they do? How do they decide among the many possibilities?

linguistics,"French vs. Québécois pronunciation of English ""th""","The stereotypical Parisian speaking English says ""ss"" and ""zz"" for ""θ"" and ""ð"" respectively.

Does anyone know why this happens? Is it something about the divergent phonologies of French?  Or does it have something to do with the British English learned in France vs. the North American English in Quebec?   


One more eccentric theory that struck me is sociological. Whereas the French mainly picked up English directly from native Britons, non-elite French Canadians began learning English as they migrated from rural areas to the more multilingual cities, especially Montreal. They had to use English to communicate with the Irish, Jewish, Greek and Italian immigrants, who might have used ""d"" and ""t"" in the place of ""th"", and the usage stuck.",1606178407,MathematicianOther12,114

linguistics,What are some examples of language becoming more complex?,"It feels as though languages become less complex over time with words becoming shorter and more contracted and grammar becoming simpler.

For example Old English used to have lot's of cases and genders, and (I Googled random etymologies) words like ""feel"" come from ""felan"", ""become"" from ""becuman"" and ""time"" from ""tima"". They seem to all have lost their last syllables. And the development of ""I am going to"" into ""I'm gonna"" and even just ""imma"".

Of course it is not possible that language simply gets simpler because it has been evolving for hundreds of thousands of years and we would have reached the most simple possible point by now.

I do know about some explanations already such as the fact that proto-indo-european was an unusually complex grammar-ed language so that's why we the grammar is getting less complex and I also know about how the [h] in ""hue"" has become a new [ç].

* Asking how we would transcribe something
* Asking how a feature works in a particular language

*Not-so-quick questions:*

* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

linguistics,Strange similarities between Old Turkic and Elder Futhark,"A few years ago, while I was doing some research about the history of Central Asia, I noticed something odd: many letters of the Old Turkic script bear a striking resemblance to the runes of Elder Futhark, and while the sounds they represent don't necessarily correspond, some are actually written identically. This piqued my curiosity, so I looked into the Kharosthi and Sogdian scripts-- both supposed to be the most likely direct ancestors of Old Turkic. Neither shared any characters with Old Turkic, though several Kharosthi letters did look fairly similar.

I was also doing an independent study on the Child Ballads at the time, and while looking into the respective songs and folk tales of early Scandinavian and Turkic peoples, I found more intriguing possible connections. Most of my focus/energy were devoted to finishing a few term papers and studying for some final exams, so I unfortunately didn't write most of this stuff down and can't provide specifics, but I distinctly remember some similarities in funerary customs and cultural practices involving the sky that were just strong enough to make me wonder if they were more than coincidence.

linguistics,"Verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese, delimitative/diminutive?","Verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese is generally described in the literature as signaling a delimitative/tentative aspect (e.g. Chao 1968, Li &amp; Thompson 1981). The basic qualities are ""a short duration (i.e. transitoriness) and/or a low iteration frequency"" (Xiao &amp; McEnery 2004). For example: *kan* 'look' -&gt; *kan-kan* 'look a little bit, look for a little while'. It can (but not necessarily) also imply looking repeatedly (and each time briefly).

Recently,  I encountered some literature on verbal diminutives/iteratives/frequentatives/pluractionals, in part also realized via reduplication. They are defined as ""derived verbs denoting activities of low intensity"" and ""the activity they denote is often repetitive or characterized by a sequence of smaller sub-events, which results in an iterative reading"" (Audring et. al. 2017). For example in Modern Hebrew: *laxaš* 'to whisper' -&gt; *lixšeš* 'to whisper quietly', *caxak* 'to laugh' -&gt; *cixkek* 'to giggle'.

Now that the definitions and examples of delimitative and diminutive look quite similar, I was wondering if they are actually the same thing just with different terminology, and if not, what is the difference and what is their relationship? A quick search in Google Scholar didn't give me any reference on verbal diminutives in Mandarin Chinese (only some on nominal ones).

And since the delimitative meaning of verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese is often described as an aspect, can verbal diminutive be considered a kind of aspect, as well? Can both phenomena be described with the same/a similar structure?

Any discussion on the meaning and the structure of verbal reduplication in Mandarin Chinese (or in other Sinitic languages) is also welcomed!

Thanks in advance!

linguistics,Connection between language and cognition?,"I hope this sub is the right place for this question: 


Years ago, when I was a student, I did a project where I chose to research a link between language and cognition. 


Of course it was a very basic overview of available information, I was a high school student when I wrote it over a decade ago. I'm not a linguist or a psychologist or anything remotely close to. I've not studied languages in depth. It was just something that piqued my curiosity. 


I just found my old report buried in my hard drive and it got me to thinking about the topic again. I'm hoping someone has looked into this more deeply. 


The basic premise i was looking at was - if the foundations of a language (what it is and is not capable of describing succinctly) could define or constrict a person's ability to rationalize certain concepts?



If anyone has any links to articles or studies that they'd be willing to share I'd love to read them.

I'm a big fan of the new Italian series ""Romulus"" in which all of the dialogue appears to be in Proto-Latin. I was really impressed when I figured it out : one says ""Bhrater"" rather than ""Frater"" and ""Bhloses"" rather than ""Flores"". 

Anyway, I'm looking of any information on, or critique of, the Old Latin in the show in terms of what is attested and what is merely reconstructed. Especially, the feature where all the verbs that would later end in consonants end in ""i"" so lots of sentences end with ""esti"", giving it a very particular vibe. 

Its a new show so not much has come up yet. I kind of randomly found this show, so even if none can answer my questions I'm glad to share this with others interested in historical linguistics and reconstruction.

Would a writing system like Mandarin’s cause learners to have a harder time hearing words learned in a written context when they first hear them in a spoken context? Alternatively, do languages like English, Spanish, etc make it easier since every time you read a word you’re seeing a representation of its sounds? Or is there simply no relation at all?

Aside from obviously copying from each other (case in point: the lexeme ""winter"" was recorded as 由福 by every of the three writers, which probably read as \*yufu and suggests Japanese *fuyu* ""winter""), does these records truly represent a Ryukyuan language?

For example:

1. 日，非祿/飛陸。 The ""sun"" is \*firu, which suggests the Japanese morpheme *hi* ""sun"". However, all Ryukyuan languages (as far as I know) and even Kagoshima calls the sun *tida* or the like. We would have to assume a spread from Kagoshima post-conquest in 1609; is this possible?
2. 月，都急。The ""moon"" is \*tuki, which does fall in line with the Proto-Japonic morpheme \*tukuy (Japanese *tsuki,* Okinawan *chichi*). However we would have to assume the word undergoes \*tu&gt;tsu&gt;tsi&gt;chi within the 400 years available to us, which I think is quite a stretch.
3.  琉球人，倭急拿必周。A ""Ryukyuan"" is \*wokinaapichu. The modern Ryukyuan *uchinaanchu* has a possessive -n- but the record does not seem to have any possessive.

The e-mail:

""I am almost adamant the i did in fact sign the deferral form-- after all, it wouldn't make much sense to return an incomplete sheet to the office. Still, memory may serve me wrong, but i am almost certain that the form was signed.""

Problem 1: you don't remember signing it, youre just certain the form was signed because it wouldn't make sense to return and unsigned form go the office.

Problem 2: still, memory may serve me wrong, but i am almost certain that the form was signed. Well yeah that's saying i can be wrong about ""after all, it wouldn't make much sense to return an incompletr sheet to the office"" but despite that, i still returned the form back regardless of possibly having no previous intention of deferring because she didnt even say i remember signing the form in problem 1, she just said ""i am certain that the form was signed because it wouldn't make sense to return an unsigned form to the office.""

In details as to what i just explained and what my sister has said about it.

The e-mail you just read was composed by my sister and sent to me on whatsapp (i didnt ask her to nor did she tell me she composed this for me to send until she whatsapped it to me) to send to the campus director of admissions in regards to an amendment form that i signed which promises that my tuition would stay the same even when i defer my program. The two examples i have under (A) would suggest i have the intention of deferring and would not suggest ""after all, it wouldn't make much sense to return an incomplete sheet to the office"" statement to be true because she later wrote ""still, memory may serve me wrong"" followed in the sentence. In other words, that's saying ""i might've actually returned the form back regardless"" which means i possibly had no intention to defer when i returned the form back to the office in february 2020. Whereas, if she wrote ""i may have forgotten to sign the form"" it would not suggest the *statement* in the e-mail to be true. However, she says the two phrases mean the same thing which is wrong in may ways.

Just one simple phrase like the two examples i have under (A) 

(A) either one of my two versions work:

I remembered to sign the form.
OR
I may have forgotten to sign the form.

Simple as that.

OR to keep her long and tedious sentence but replace either almost ""certain"" to ""i remembered to"" or ""still, memory may serve me wrong"" to ""i may have forgotten to sign the form"" as either one of the replacement words would not be suggesting that the statement : ""after all, it wouldn't  make much sense to return an incomplete sheet to the office"" to be true when followed by the phrase ""still, memory may serve me wrong""

I will show you how either of the the replacement words work

Option 1: 
If you ""remembered to sign the form"" the director would not be able to say, ""you only (remember signing) the form because it wouldn't make sense for you to return an incomplete sheet to the office."" Which is in reference to the statement ""it wouldn't make much sense to return an incomplete sheet to the office"". Like, that just doesnt work because you already said you remember signing the form. Whereas, when she uses almost ""certain"" that the form was signed the director can say ""you're only almost(certain) that the form was signed because it wouldn't make much sense for you to return an incomplete sheet to the office"" in this case, you don't  ""remember"" signing it, you're just ""certain"" that the form was signed because of the statement mentioned before.

""I am almost adamant that i did in fact sign the deferral form-- after all, it wouldn't make much sense to return an incomplete sheet to the office. Still, memory may serve me wrong, but (i remembered to) sign the form.""

Option 2: 
Replace the phrase ""still, memory may serve me wrong"" to ""i may have forgotten to sign the form"" because when replaced, this new phrase would not suggest the statement ""after all, it wouldn't make much sense to return an incomplete sheet to the office"" to become true but when the original phrase is kept, that's in other words saying ""yeah, i probably did return the form back regardless"" of possibly having no intention of deferring back in february 2020.

""I am almost adamant that i did in fact sign the deferral form-- after all, it wouldn't make much sense to return an incomplete sheet to the office. I may have (forgotten to) sign the form, but i am almost certain that the form was complete.""


VS.


(B) her version: 

I am almost adamant that i did in fact sign the deferral sheet -- After all, it wouldn't make much such to return an incomplete sheet to the office. Still, memory may serve me wrong, but i am almost certain that the form was complete.

(My sister said neither of the replacement words are needed even after i explained all this to her above. She still insists that in this instance, ""still, (memory) may serve me wrong"" is the same as ""i may have (forgotten to) sign the form"" AND that ""i am almost (certain) that the form was signed"" does not need to be replaced with ""i (remembered to) sign the form"" BUT when she decides to keep ""still, (memory) may serve me wrong"" then that other phrase ""i am almost (certain) that the form was signed)"" needs to be replaced given in option 1.)",1605921323,Consistent_Ad907,2

Whereas, when she uses almost ""certain"" that the form was signed the director can say ""you're only almost(certain) that the form was signed because it wouldn't make much sense for you to return an incomplete sheet to the office"" in this case, you don't  ""remember"" signing it, you're just ""certain"" that the form was signed because of the statement mentioned before.

""I am almost adamant that i did in fact sign the deferral form-- after all, it wouldn't make much sense to return an incomplete sheet to the office. Still, memory may serve me wrong, but (i remembered to) sign the form.""

Option 2: 
Replace the phrase ""still, memory may serve me wrong"" to ""i may have forgotten to sign the form"" because when replaced, this new phrase would not suggest the statement ""after all, it wouldn't make much sense to return an incomplete sheet to the office"" to become true but when the original phrase is kept, that's in other words saying ""yeah, i probably did return the form back regardless"" of possibly having no intention of deferring back in february 2020.

""I am almost adamant that i did in fact sign the deferral form-- after all, it wouldn't make much sense to return an incomplete sheet to the office. I may have (forgotten to) sign the form, but i am almost certain that the form was complete.""

I was wondering what is the narrow transcription of the following words: **Can, might, friend, jittery, tackle, pleased, spies**. Your narrow transcriptions should indicate aspiration, liquid devoicing, Canadian raising, flapping/tapping, nasalization, and syllabic consonants, if applicable.

linguistics,Second language acquisition: motivation vs. exposure,"Hi there!

I am currently writing my master's thesis for Linguistics, the topic concerns, among other things, Second Language Acquisition. I am currently stuck, and I was wondering if you could help me out! I am writing one theoretic part about the factors that could influence second language proficiency, and how motivation could help fill in certain gaps where other factors cannot. My supervisor told me that exposure is often used as a factor to explain high L2 proficiency. However he told me that exposure does not sufficiently explain high L2 proficiency when an in individual has been more or less equally exposed to several second languages, and becomes the most proficient in one language in particular. He adds that motivation could explain such a cases.

Now my question is, how am I going to substantiate this, i.e. is there any literature in which this is addressed/challenges exposure as a factor? Cause I have a hard time finding it. I also get confused, because to me, exposure always accompanies motivation: if you are highly motivated in a language you (presumably) expose yourself more to that language, so as to learn more.

She is basically saying that i might've had no intention of deferring. She insists that in this instance ""still, memory may serve me wrong"" is the same as ""i may have forgotten to sign the form"" . she says that ""still memory may serve me wrong"" and ""i may be remembering incorrectly"" (since they mean the same thing) is the same as saying ""i may have forgotten to sign the form"" would suggest which is obviously not true. none of what she composed is suggesting that. Since she insists that there's nothing wrong with the phrase she composed which reads ""still, (memory) may serve me wrong"" is any different than ""i may have (forgotten) to sign the form"" would suggest then she must replace another part in her other phrase which reads ""i am almost (certain) that the form was complete"" to ""i (remembered) to sign the form"" because this and the ""i may have (forgotten)"" would not suggest the ""it wouldnt make much sense to return an incomplete sheet to the office"" to be true.. that i may have actually returned the form back regardless of having no intention to defer

(A) either one of my two versions works:

I remembered to sign the form.
OR
I may have forgotten to sign the form.

OR to keep her long and tedious sentence but replace either almost ""certain"" to ""i remembered to"" or ""still, memory may serve me wrong"" to ""i may have forgotten"" as these replacement words would not be suggesting that ""after all, it wouldn't  make much sense to return an incomplete sheet to the office"" to be true because ""i remembered to sign the form"" would suggest i have the intention of deferring and ""i may have forgotten to sign the form"" does too.

linguistics,"Relative Clause Strategies - What, When, Where, Why, and How?","Essentially, I want to understand the diachronics of the different relativization strategies. As of now, I know of 1) interrogatives (Eng. \*which\*, Latin \*qui\*, etc), 2) complimentizer/demonstratives (English \*that\*, Bantu iirc), 3) adjectival/attributive verb forms (Dravidian, Japonic), 4) genitive constructions (Turkic, iirc).

If there are any I missed, I would appreciate both synchronic and diachronic explanations for them.

So, to my questions:

1) What is the earliest reconstructable relativization strategy in PIE? Does it have reflexes in modern IE languages?

2) What was the diachronic process for PIE interrogatives to turn into relative pronouns? I realize they aren't 100% mappable, but they did derive from interrogatives.

3) I have heard that some IA languages have increased usage of adjectival strategies from contact with Dravidian languages. If this is true, how did they develop attributive forms in the first place?

4) Conversely, how do languages that employ an attributive strategy develop a different strategy?

5) How do demonstratives develop into relativizers? I have traced back English \*that\* to a merger of OE demonstrative \*þæt\* with the indeclinable \*þe\*, whose etymology I can't find. u/merijn has informed me that Bantu languages also widely employ this strategy. How does this occur?

As all of us are aware, English orthography is riddled with exceptions and inconsistencies. Most of these, however, stem from two main phenomena: 1) the Great Vowel Shift that took place in spoken English right when written English was being standardised and 2) an orthography that usually  prefers etymology over pronunciation.

However, as far as I am aware, the \[əl\] pronunciation precedes the Great Vowel Shift and many of the examples I mentioned are of (West) Germanic origin and have cognates in Dutch (appel, luttel, pekel, ratelen) or German (Apfel, lützel, Pökel, Drossel) that are written with -el instead of -le.",1605802620,Leiegast,68

I was sort of just fascinated by how many different sounds the letter ""R"" represents in scripts around the world. You have the rhotic ""R"" in American English (and I guess a silent ""R"" in non-rhotic dialects), the tapped ""R"" and trilled ""R"" in Spanish, the guttural ""R"" in French, and the retroflex ""R"" in the pinyin romanization of Mandarin Chinese. 

The letter ""C"" has also been utilized to represent various sounds. In English, you have the ""C"" like in *cat* and the ""C"" in *pencil*. In peninsular Spanish, you have the voiceless dental fricative ""C"" in *cenar*. In Italian, you have the voiceless postalveolar affricate ""C"" in *ciao*. And in Turkish, you have the voiced postalveolar affricate ""C"" like in *acı*. 

And these are just those that I've observed in languages that I've dabbled in and that use the Latin alphabet.

Our weekly Q&amp;A thread is the perfect place to post them! A new Q&amp;A thread goes up every Monday, but we have people who read them regularly throughout the week.

**What counts as a “quick question”?**

Any question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate discussion all of the time, here are some examples: 

*Quick questions:*

* Asking for an explanation of a technical term
* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature
* Asking how we would transcribe something
* Asking how a feature works in a particular language

*Not-so-quick questions:*

* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

Also, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first.

**What if I didn't get an answer to my question last week?**

Your question probably wasn’t answered because no one who knew the answer saw it.

It's been years since I've had to study grammar formally, and my knowledge is rusty. I hope I will be able to get my point across without too much struggle, but if you need clarification, just ask, and I'll try to oblige as best I can.

When I was very young, my mom spoke a lot of Japanese to me, and tried to teach me a bit. She once got stuck when I tried to ask her how to say the word ""and"" in Japanese, and basically just said ""It's complicated because it depends"". Fast forward to present day, and I'm learning Japanese at university, and now I finally understand what she meant. 

So far in my limited study, I've already learned 3 different ways to say ""and"". Probably oversimplifying, but ""と"" is used for a complete listing of nouns/noun phrases (e.g. I found my hat **and** my jacket in the lost and found), ""や” is used for incomplete listings (e.g. There are hats **and** jackets in the lost and found \[implied: amongst other things\]), and, hugely oversimplifying this one so apologies to anyone who speaks Japanese, ""て"" to link adjectives and verbs (e.g. My jacket is comfy **and** warm, so I wear it when I go outside **and** when I go skiing).

Now that I've started thinking about it, I can't get out of my head how many different functions ""and"" plays in the english language. A few more examples would be ""lost **and** found"" and joining complete clauses together. **And**, despite what my 7th grade english teacher claimed, you can start a perfectly sensible grammatical sentence with ""and"". **And** so on **and** so on **and** so on. There are definitely other uses of ""and"" that I can't think of right now as well.

My point with this is thus: how do other languages treat conjunctions in comparison to english? Is english abnormal in its use of a broadly specifying ""and""-type conjunction, or is Japanese abnormal here? Or does it depend on the broad language family (i.e. Indo-European languages tend to have a broad ""and"", but Japonic languages don't)? What are some other interesting features of conjunctions in other languages?",1605416836,Blooderised25592,27

Help!","I have been really interested in accents ever since someone told me that I don't sound like I'm from 'here', (Washington DC). This has made me really confused since I have moved around a lot as a kid and DC isn't known for a particular accent that stands out, primarily known for a general American (though I've read the Maryland accent is beginning to intrude into DC). This has led me down a rabbit hole of comparing my pronunciation of words with General American. 

One thing I have noticed is that I replace the vowel ""**ä**"", (in words such as top, cop, bop, or taught), with ""**ɑ**"". So instead of tahhwt, its Tawwt. I also notice I pronounced words with a long ""**O**"" such as boat, oat, hope, goat with ""**o̞**"". My parents are from New Jersey and Michigan, each with noticeable accents. I've lived in DC and California repeatedly. I would like to know if I fit in with a particular accent/dialect anywhere, and if so, where. Also would like to know if my parents and the places I've lived have made a large impact on pronunciation. 

**An important thing** is that my sister and I have both remarked with each other that we sometimes both pronounce House, About, and Out, like Hoçe, Uh-bote, and Ote, but of course only happens when don't concentrate on it. We have both been told by people in DC and in California (Southern California), that we don't sound like we're from there.

There are so many mistakes in this e-mail i had only found out after i sent it out (i only read it once before sending it). Shown below is not the entire e-mail sent it is just two of the bigger problems seen in the e-mail.

Her version:
I am almost certain that i did in fact sign the deferral form--after all, it wouldn't make much sense to return an incomplete sheet to the office. Still, my memory may serve me wrong, but i'm almost adamant that the form was complete. 

My version:
I remembered to sign the form so why else would the form be unsigned and returned. After all, it wouldn't make much sense to return an unsigned form to the office.

1st problem: She made it seem like the reason that i am sure that the form was signed is all dependent on the idea that it wouldnt make sense to return the form unsigned because she used the word certain instead of the word ""remembered (to sign the form)"". 

2nd problem: to say ""still memory may serve me wrong"" to me it seems that she's saying memory may serve me wrong as i might've returned the form regardless of no intention of deferring so that's why the form is unsigned ""still, memory may serve me wrong""",1605382959,Consistent_Ad907,25

linguistics,Why did Chinese Writing never become an alphabet?,"All writings started as logographs, which is true. But while most systems have become alphabetic, only Chinese remains stubbornly non-alphabetic and/or semi-alphabetic.

Chinese is a failed alphabet. No I'm not being racist, I say this as a background speaker of Chinese. Egyptian Hieroglyphs became Phoenician, then became Greek, Latin, Arabic. Chinese characters also gave rise to Japanese kana and Korean Hangul.

It means that Chinese characters *can* be phoneticised. Chinese people just really don't want them to be. Chinese has numerous dialects that are clearly separate languages - they are more distinct from each other than French is from Spanish, or Danish is from Norwegian.

Chinese governments have been using the hanzi characters to convince many separate populations that they are the same ethnicity and therefore the same nation, for millenia. Chinese regional cultural differences are as different from each other as the many different nationalities that make up the European Union. 

Yet because European nations use alphabets and therefore their writings and spellings look wildly different, they can convince their populations that they are indeed different peoples, despite their languages being closer to each other than many Chinese dialects are.

China failed to produce a truly phonetic alphabet/syllabry because the characters are convenient for the unification of several different peoples and cultures with shared history (as is the case in Europe) and no Chinese government wants to lose this unity.",1605355007,hapi4eva,26

linguistics,Compound Verb Tenses,"In Ancient Latin, they could say a lot with fewer words because of all the little endings they could tack onto a root. All those verb conjugations, noun cases, et cetera.

Those mostly became unproductive / obsolete /archaic over time as the Romance languages developed.

In Italian (purely as an example), one can use compound verb tenses like '(Io) ho trovato.' 'I have found.'

I don't know enough about Latin to say this with any certainty, but I feel like the Latin way of saying this would center around a complex form of their version of the root 'find'. Latin is condensed and curt, while Italian feels 'unpacked'. 

What is this phenomenon? Is this an example of a kind of shift from a more synthetic language to one that is more isolating/analytical?

The Philippines is basically adopted Spaniard culture in all but the tongue on the surface. Architecture, religions, social customs, traditional clothing, music, and so on are indistinguishable from Latin America. Even the main language has a lot of loan words from Portuguese and Spanish. Yet Philippines is classified under SouthEast Asian culture despite outsiders often mistaking pictures of the country as being Mexico or Cuba or some other Latin American place. The biggest arguments about why Filipinos are not Hispanic or even Latino is primarily because Spanish is not the tongue of the country and Tagalog is not romance either in the way Portugal is which is why Brazil is classified as a Latin country. Tagalog is far closer to Austronesian, the family language of Indonesia and Malaysia along with much of SouthEast Asia so Philippines is not considered Hispanic or Latino but within the Austronesian cultural grouping even with the major amount of Spanish in various Filipino tongues.

linguistics,About Proto-Germanic infinitives and past participles,"As far as my Wiktionary skills go, Proto-Germanic infinitives and past participles are reconstructed with -ą and -az endings respectively.

For example:

* \**etaną* (to eat), \**etanaz* (eaten)
* \**grōtijaną* (to greet), \**grōtidaz* (greeted)

These are also the endings for a-stems, neuter and masculine, respectively. Is this a coincidence?

In the W. Ge. languages I can think of (English / Low Saxon / German), past participles can act as adjectives, and may be inflected as such.

Is this a common innovation in this branch, or is the -az ending in the past participle shown in Wiktionary only for sake of simplicity i.e. past participle may decline as -az, -ą, and -ǭ stems?

Is there ""anything else"" interesting to say about the -ą ending in the infinite? Bonus points: how the heck did we reconstruct an -ą ending in the infinitive if not even Gothic preserves it?",1605217120,HannesHendrik,6

linguistics,"How do we read? Are there any theories of linguistics about how the mind, perhaps at an unconscious level, scans a page of text...","Are there any theories in linguistics about how the mind, perhaps at an unconscious level, scans a page of text and absorbs from it is some kind of crude meaning (perhaps a kind of “gestalt”), forms a feeling or opinion about it, before doing the higher-level activity of reading it sequentially and parsing out the meaning formally by reading the whole text?

Caveat: Some, if not all, of these questions fall outside the purvue of Linguistics, and I am asking people from other disciplines similar questions. But I'm curious to hear what linguists have to say. 

Consideration and Questions:

1) For example, might an experienced editor of a print newspaper look at a front page above the fold and decide “we’re sending the wrong message here.” The article’s writer, let’s suppose, wrote a glowing review about a certain politician’s actions. But the editor views it with his keen eye, and something about a) the prominence and frequency of words used and b) the way they are arranged upon the page that may lead a reader to from unintended conclusions about the subject matter. Is there any linguistic theory about this?

2) Anecdotally, my older brother “seemed” to have a “knack” (we’re talking about twenty years ago) for looking a single page document and making judgments about it; his claim to fame seemed to be (print) resumes. He’d scan it and say, “you have the word ‘high turnover’ in one of your job descriptions, and that sends the wrong message, especially the way you have it here so prominently along the left-hand margin…” From the perspective of linguistics, was there any validity to his approach?

3) Do we really read sequentially? I took a Digital Marketing course once, and the professor explained that the way we scan a page (or more relevantly to the course, our smartphones) is different from how we’re taught to read: left to right, top to bottom. Rather, our eye jumps around from the top, skipping over the “two o’clock” position (often filled with ads), down the left-hand side, then back to fill in the details. Aagain, I realize this question is out of the purview of r/linguistics , and more in the area of design, but there’s a lot of smart, inter-disciplinary folks on this sub who may have insight to share. 

4) Do any prominent linguists have anything to say about [WordClouds](https://www.keatext.ai/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/word-clouds-hero.jpg)? Are they in way an approximation of how the mind organizes data about text?

Is it more often used in written forms (such as social media posts) or orally?Are the neutral forms used frequently in coloquial/casual conversations?

But it looks like Min languages don't have this initial \[j\], at least from what I know of Hokkien and Teochew. The closest sound is probably words that simply begin with the vowel \[i\] like 饿 /iau/  伊 /i/  药 /ioʔ/. I guess it's very easy for the 'naked' initial \[i\] slip into a \[j\] when speaking fast, so it's possible that \[i\] and \[j\] are somewhat allophonic in Min languages.

linguistics,Nasal vowels in British English?(RP),"Hi! I'm a French speakers and I have noticed that many French speakers tend to use nasal vowels when they speak English and this even when they have an advanced level of English(even most of my non-native teachers do it). This is especially true when they decide to go for a British accent. They tend to replace the vowel /ɑː/ by /ã/, when it comes before vowels. So words like France, chance, dance or circumstance get pronounced with a nasal vowel. 

I never hear native speakers pronounce those words that way and they are all transcribed with /ɑː/ in the dictionary, anyway. I also know that nasal vowels are not supposed to occur in Standard English, except in some French loanwords such as ""en masse"", or my absolute favorite ""croissant"". However, when I was on YouGlish, something really surprised me: when I looked for the word ""can't"", I swear that for more than half of the recordings I could hear it pronounced as /kãt/(with a French nasal vowel) rather than /kɑːnt/ as in the dictionary. Yet, I couldn't hear that nasal vowel when I typed the words I mentioned above(like France or dance). So, do RP speakers tend to pronounce a nasal vowel in can't or am I just going crazy?

My question is then how is it that gender neutral language is not implicitly affirming the validity of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis? One of its implications is that language creates culture, which is exactly the assumption behind gender neutral pronouns. The idea that language determines thought also implies that our perceptions are relative to our language, and the basic assumption here is that you will no longer perceive a trans woman as a man if you use the correct pronouns, for example. So if the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is so widely rejected, why do people seem to uphold it regarding this specific issue?
Radical feminists such as Judith Butler do have an influence of 19th century German philosophy, more specifically of Hegel and Romanticism, from where the notion of linguistic relativity stems from.

linguistics,What determines the sounds that children use when they can't form the proper sound of the language?,"I was talking with a friend who speaks Brazilian Portuguese about how American children often go through a phase where they can't say ""r"" properly, and instead use a w sound.

What determines the sound that children who can't fully articulate their native sounds choose in place of the proper sound? Both English and Brazilian Portuguese have the L and W sounds, as far as I can tell. It seemed counter-intuitive to me that children who can't say an R would replace it with an L, but of course, I'm not a native speaker of Brazilian Portuguese so very little of the language would be intuitive to me. 

Is there some deeper structure going on here? Is the formation of the Brazilian Portuguese R in the mouth more similar to the formation of L in that language?",1605032897,lawpoop,55

linguistics,Does complementary distribution necessarily imply allophony?,"Usually complementary distribution is used almost as a synonym for allophony but fundamentally allophony is the idea that two sounds are realizations of the same phoneme, that the two sounds are considered ""the same"" in the speaker's mind. This should imply that native speakers would have trouble telling them apart when you swap the environments. They would be able to tell that it sounds ""wrong"", or ""foreign accented"" but not be able to point out exactly why that is the case.   

The reason why I bring this up is because of the case of the Standard Chinese alveolo-palatal sibilant series ""j q x"" (in Pinyin). They are actually in a complementary distribution with three different series of sounds: the dental sibilants ""z c s"", retroflex sibilants ""zh ch sh"", and velar stops and fricatives ""k g h"". Diachronically, they are the result of the merger of the palatal allophones of the dental sibilants and velar stops and fricatives. Synchronically, they are seen as allophones of the retroflex sibilants because of having more similar phonotactics.  

However, Standard Chinese speakers don't seem have trouble distinguishing them the way that is typical of ""normal"" allophones. They recognize them as distinct sounds. Case in point: when Standard Chinese speakers are learning Polish, they have no trouble distinguishing alveolo-palatal and retroflex sibilants when they appear in the same environment.    


So are they allophones or not?",1605019888,LokiPrime13,4

linguistics,"Is there any kind of guide that explores a link between sounds we make (regardless of what the words they create actually mean) and the implied meaning, connotation, or subtext that is likely to arise in the listeners'/readers minds?","I'm a writer (not a linguist per se). But I've had this question on my mind for over a year now.

1) One might put together a text containing sentences with a fairly clear meaning. For example, some of the sentences might read like this:

""Plastic gloves protect the fingers from liquid.""

On the surface, the meaning is pretty clear. But the reader might walk away from that text feeling, ""I don't know. But the text seemed sort of...sensual. Kinda sexy."" 

It may be some of the sounds chosen, all the L's: the las in plastic, the love in glove, the li in liquid, seems to suggest to the reader that, at least according to how those sounds are used in his native language. But  love/sex/romance probably isn't what the author was going for.

2) As a writer, I find myself wanting to manage (though not control) the subtext that emerges in the readers' mind. We have lots of rhetorical devices to do that: repetition, cadence, anaphora, polyptoton, etc. So good writers know how to lead the mind where they want to go. But it's happened to me many times that a reader will read something I wrote and get all kinds of ""vibes"" I never intended. I hear comments like ""I get a gay vibe in this scene,"" or ""this character comes off a bit arrogant,"" or  ""this part feels really sad,"" when I was not going for any of these. And I can't help think that perhaps it has to be with phonemes and morphemes that I am using that may be creating unintended consequences. (I'm well aware that weird interpretations of a text have as much to do with the background of the reader, where they're at in life, and so on, which is why ""controlling"" subtext is a pipe dream).

3) Are there any tools that assist with this? A chart, some list, some database? Ideally, it'd be cool if there was something like those readability analyzers where one copies and pastes a text into it, and it gives you back data about reading grade level, sentence length, and difficulty. Some tool where it looks at your sound and offers some broad generalization of meanings they may suggest apart from the direct denotations of the words.

I may be dreaming; given the subjective nature of the matter, such tools are unlikely to exist. 

But I thought it'd be fun to ask.",1605011356,niceguybadboy,27

linguistics,A question about japanese and the Kra-Dai languages.,"So Alexander Volvin proposed that the japonic urheimat is in Southern China, and that proto-japanese may have been a monosyllabic, SVO and isolating language. Now, Southern China on it's own is already a problem, since so many languages are underresearched, but he also points something I have a doubt about: Did he propose that these characteristics are because of intense contact between the proto-japonic language with the Kra-Dai languages, or that it was the result of contact between Japanese already established in the islands with the Kra-Dai languages? 

Also, is this areal contact that may have given the characteristics noted by him to this proto-japonic widely accepted, or more disregarded?

Forget the historical registers that allow us to clearly distinguish widespread Latin, Greek and Sanskrit loans from cognates or Wanderwörter.

linguistics,Pragmatics in Salish Languages,"I was browsing through wikipedia and I came across a claim in the article about Salish languages that seemed a little far fetched. I was under the assumption that negotiating the difference in assumed knowledge on the part of the speaker and listener was a universal feature of language. Is this another case of people exoticizing an indigenous language and drawing really broad conclusions based on features they don’t understand (like the idea that Hopi can’t express time,) or is this based on something real?


(article section quoted below. I know it’s really poorly cited, but I’d be interested to know if someone with a background in these languages could explain what, if anything, is being misinterpreted here.)

“At least one Salish language, Lillooet Salish, differs from Indo-European languages in terms of pragmatics. Lillooet Salish does not allow presuppositions about a hearer's beliefs or knowledge during a conversation.[8][9][10] To demonstrate, it's useful to compare Lillooet Salish determiners with English determiners. English determiners take the form of the articles ‘a’, ‘an’ and ‘the’. The indefinite articles ‘a’ and ‘an’ refer to an object that is unfamiliar or that has not been previously referenced in conversation. The definite article ‘the’ refers to a familiar object about which both the speaker and the listener share a common understanding. Lillooet Salish and several other Salish languages use the same determiner to refer to both familiar and unfamiliar objects in conversation. For example, when discussing a woman, Lillooet Salish speakers used [ɬəsɬánay] (with [ɬə] serving as the determiner and [sɬánay] meaning ‘woman’) to refer to the woman both when initially introducing her and again when referencing her later on in the conversation. Thus, no distinction is made between a unique object and a familiar one.[citation needed]

This absence of varying determiners is a manifestation of the lack of presuppositions about a listener in Salish.[citation needed] Using a definite article would presuppose a mental state of the listener: familiarity with the object in question. Similarly, a Salishan language equivalent of the English sentence ""It was John who called"" would not require the assumption that the listener knows that someone called. In English, such a sentence implies that someone called and serves to clarify who the caller was. In Salish, the sentence would be void of any implication regarding the listener's knowledge. Rather, only the speaker's knowledge about previous events is expressed.

The absence of presuppositions extends even to elements that seem to inherently trigger some kind of implication, such as ‘again’, ‘more’, ‘stop’, and ‘also’. For example, in English, beginning a conversation with a sentence like ""It also rained yesterday"" would probably be met with confusion from the listener. The word ‘also’ signifies an addition to some previously discussed topic about which both the speaker and the listener are aware. However, in Salish, a statement like ""It also rained yesterday"" is not met with the same kind of bewilderment. The listener's prior knowledge (or lack thereof) is not conventionally regarded by either party in a conversation. Only the speaker's knowledge is relevant.”",1604947382,hapaxlegoman,19

linguistics,Syntax - DP Hypothesis,"So I've been reading about X' schema and DP hypothesis (which claims that all noun phrases are actually headed by determiners in DPs). 

According to this hypothesis, every language has determiners, even if they're silent (like Russian or Polish etc.) They argue that it facilitates drawing parallels between different languages and creates a more uniform notation. Otherwise, every sentence would be easier to represent on a syntax tree (=there would be fewer nodes), but it would be at the expense of creating a lot more elementary trees (separate ones for NPs and DPs). 

My syntax teacher said that this ""may not be enough of an argument"" for the existence of silent determiners, but I don't really know what they might have meant by that?? For me personally, systemising the system is a pretty convincing argument and it's in line with generative grammar.

linguistics,"Can I have help with finding Eastern Massachusetts accent pronunciation of ""Bedford""","I was born Eastern Massachusetts, from Boston country but not Boston.

linguistics,Can't figure out if I'm in the wrong field or if research isn't for me,"I'm an undergrad who has been majoring in linguistics for about two years now, and I really enjoy it. At my school it's super common for undergrads to get involved with research, so it only seemed natural for me to seek out some research too. After many rejections, a sociolinguistics prof agreed to take me on. I wasn't  sure if all her research fit with my interests, but there was one aspect I liked, and that was bilingualism. Therefore, I got to work on the lit review that she assigned. That's when I hit my stumbling block. I strongly disliked reading the research articles. After some soul searching, I pinned down some possible reasons why. This prof focuses on sociolinguistics in a family context, which I found hard to relate to. Secondly, the research seemed to lean more towards the soc than the ling. 

I searched the school website for other professors, and I was overwhelmed with options. This time my search also turned up education, psychology, and applied linguistics profs. They all did language-related work, and I could see the merits of all their research. But that's exactly what I thought about the current prof. I don't want to switch projects and then realize I don't enjoy the research once again. 

That leads me to another issue. I don't know if I will even be able to switch professors. Undergrad research is pretty cutthroat. Most research groups are at full capacity, and when there is an opening the interview slots fill up super fast. If I leave my current prof I have no idea how long it will take to find a position, let alone something that interests me. 

Finally, I have been considering the possibility that I'm just not cut out for research. I love learning about linguistics, but perhaps that love doesn't extend beyond the classroom. I'm not yet sure if that's the case. I will admit school culture had a lot to do with my decision to try research. Before COVID there were tons of undergrad research presentations on campus. I was surrounded by classmates who were involved with research, and constantly heard about the important work they did. Perhaps my expectations were just too idealistic. 

Sorry for the long rant. This issue has been simmering in my head for a while now, and I needed to sort out all my thoughts.",1604891688,Sad_Shoe,6

linguistics,NSM explication of Discourse Particles in Singlish?,"Colloquial Singapore English (CSE), otherwise known as Singlish, is known for having a variety of discourse particles conveying pragmatic meanings. For example, ""what"" (with low, flat intonation) is used clause-finally to convey that what one has just asserted is an obvious truth, and ""meh"" (high, flat intonation) is used to convey scepticism. Consider the following conversation:

A: Let's drive to the supermarket.
B: Huh? It's very near _what_, we can just walk there.
A: Really meh? We have to walk for at least 15 minutes!

In some sense, I like to think of these discourse/pragmatic particles as being markers of different kinds of speech acts - in this case, ""what"" marks that speaker B's utterance carries the illocutionary force of a challenge to speaker A's proposal, and ""meh"" marks that speaker A's 2nd utterance is similarly intended to challenge speaker B's counterproposal by casting doubt as to its feasibility.

Now my question... Would such particles be decomposable into semantic primitives/does it make sense to study them from an NSM framework at all?

I'm assuming that semantically ""empty"" but pragmatically rich items like this can possibly be broken down into primitives (at least based on their functions), but I'm not sure if it even makes sense to approach pragmatic meaning/these particles using NSM, since on their own without the context of a sentence they are meaningless (""what"" is not a pronoun here), even if we can generally sort them by the different functions they carry.

linguistics,How are words and ideas connected?,"I’m literate in Japanese and moved to Taiwan two years ago, but didn’t immediately begin learning mandarin. My background in Japanese enabled me to understand simple written mandarin quite well: maps, signs, forms, and brief texts presented no problems. More than enough to get around on my own.

One day I was walking down a busy street and had a really peculiar experience: these characters had no sound for me, but they did have inherent meaning that actively jumped out at me. I don’t know how to describe this experience exactly; sometimes it was just a feeling, sometimes it was a picture. But it conveyed meaning.

By “no sound” I mean to say that, as these strings of characters would sound like nonsense in Japanese, I often didn’t pronounce them by their Japanese readings. But I’m also comfortable enough with Japanese that I don’t think in English when I see a character. And not yet speaking Mandarin, I didn’t know how they should be pronounced in Mandarin. So the characters were “silent”, but I understood anyhow.

So, there are a few separate entities here, and I’m not sure how they’re related:

1. A thing itself, as it exists in the world, observed or not

2. The thing as we imagine it, which may or may  or be accurate 

3. The phonemes we arbitrarily use to refer to that thing or concept 


Is #3 connected to #2 or #1? Both? What about in the situation of, say, the Statue of Liberty — something I’ve never actually seen and don’t objectively know exists? Can you separate these entities from eachother, and if so, to what extent?

linguistics,Is Russian это developing into a copula?,"это is the neutral proximal demonstrative ""this"" in Russian. Historically, copulas often develop from demonstratives and it seems that in some ways this might be happening to это. 

In modern Russian, the verb for ""to be"" no longer exists in the present tense so in the present tense there is zero copula. However, this can sometimes be confusing, particularly in the case of identity relationships (sentences like ""Noun A is definition B"") and in these cases speakers will insert an это where the null copula is. 

So instead of ""Noun A definition B"" you have ""Noun A this definition B"".

linguistics,I just wanted to say thank you,"Yes, I’m thanking linguistics as a science. But I’m also thanking you all, fellow linguists or passionate ones or whatever, you’re part of my family.

I’ve been feeling depressed and hopeless lately and I find solace in linguistics. It may sound dumb, but, when I learn about phonetic stuff, or work on a conlang or do anything related to this topic, my mind gets rid of all the negative thoughts it usually loves to drag around, and I focus on my ‘hipster’ language stuff.
Linguistics are such kind of an underground subject and hobby, it’s a bit sad but it also makes it even more beautiful: I’m glad I’m part of this weird-ass family of passionate people that love learning and creating stuff that nobody else understands even a slight bit.

I sometimes feel dumb or useless when I’m working on my conlang or binge reading wiktionary articles etc because I think to myself “What am I doing? Why can’t I have normal hobbies?”
Then I remember that I don’t care about what normality is. This is my passion and I love it, and I don’t care if there aren’t many people around that are like me. I also think about these times when I tried to explain something to non linguists and they were like “wow it sounds so complicated, very cool tho”. When you talk about something with passion, you sound captivating.

linguistics,"In Late Middle Chinese phonology/philology, what precisely is shè (攝)? Specifically, what does it account for besides vowel height and coda?","My understanding of 攝 is lacking a key piece.
If I understand correctly,
each 攝 is a partition of the set of all rimes.
But how is one 攝 different from another,
and how are the rimes in the same 攝 equal?
From what I have read,
rimes in the same 攝 have the same vowel height and coda;
vowel height is either inner (內) i.e. higher or outer (外) i.e. lower,
and coda is either none, -j, -w, -m/p, -n/t, or -ŋ/k.
However,
multiple 攝 have the same vowel height and coda:
*	果 and 假 are both 外 &amp; no coda;
*	曾 &amp; 通 — 內 &amp; -ŋ/k; and
*	宕, 江, &amp; 梗 are all 內 &amp; -ŋ/k.

Clearly then,
the combination of vowel height and coda alone does not make a 攝 unique.
To paraphrase my question,
each 攝 only contains all rimes with specific vowel height, coda, and X,
and I want to know what X is/are.

Furthermore,
many of the 攝 have more than one rime in the same division (等).
For example, 遇攝 has the rimes 魚 and 虞 in the third division.
How exactly are these rimes different from each other?
I do not see a general pattern across all 攝.

linguistics,Linguistic relativity and the color debate... and snooker?,"I was reading about [the work of Berlin and Kay regarding the names of colors in various languages](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity_and_the_color_naming_debate#Berlin_and_Kay), specifically about the (surprising) finding that most languages tend to develop words for colors in roughly the same order as follows:  

* All languages have words for white and black
* Next comes red
* Next is yellow then green, or green then yellow
* Next is blue
* Then brown 
* Then only after these do languages usually acquire words for pink, purple, orange etc.  


What struck me about this is the similarities to the modern game of snooker. The color balls (those other than white and black), are ordered as follows:  

* red
* yellow
* green
* brown
* blue
* pink

It’s a shame that blue comes after brown here, but otherwise you’ll see it fits pretty well. Is it a coincidence, do you think? It’s certainly close enough to be significant, so assuming it’s not intentional (the game of snooker predates the discovery about natural languages developing words for colors in a specific order), I think it says something interesting about the subconscious choices made when these colors were chosen for the game.

My question has to do with the very first words of the story that read as follows:

True! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses --not destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. **I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell.** How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you the whole story.

Would you know why Poe uses the definite article ""the"" for both ""heaven"" and ""earth"", but nor for ""hell""? Is it a matter of grammar or there is some type of interpretation behind it?

Most translators of this text to my language (Portuguese) overlook this detail and translate as if they were all the same, but I do not think it is something that trivial.

linguistics,Do English nouns have a concealed grammatical gender?,"Everyone knows that English nouns have no gender, unlike many other languages like German, French and Spanish for example.

My question is whether there are reasons to believe that the gender is still there, but concealed.

For example in German all nouns that are derived from a verb by adding the suffix -er have a male gender. And they are actually female if you add the suffix -erin. For example:
  machen (make) --&gt; der Macher, die Macherin
  lehren (teach) --&gt; der Lehrer, die Lehrerin
  sprechen (speak) --&gt; der Sprecher, die Sprecherin

A similar thing happens in English although the mapping is much more irregular. One big cluster uses the French derived -ess:
  to wait --&gt; the waiter, the waitress
  to act --&gt; the actor, the actess
  to host --&gt; the host, the hostess
  to steward --&gt; the steward, the stewardess

But there is also the Latin derived -or --&gt; -rix:
  to direct --&gt; the director, the directrix
  to create --&gt; the creator, the creatrix
  to act --&gt; the actor, the actrix

I would argue that all these nouns have a pretty clear grammatical English gender, which all speakers are cleanly aware of, when if they choose to ignore it.

As a result, I think critical gender theory would apply to all of these nouns, and they should all be reformed for the sake of the oppressed genders in our society. For the same reason that ""his"" should not apply to all people, and verb derived noun ending in -er or -or should also not be the default for all genders.

In addition to pronoun lists like ""he/him/his"", people should also be free to demand specific suffixes for verb derived nouns. This could be easily justified as a basic human right.

Non binary individuals could for example request the suffixes -trish to be used for them. This would certainly lead to much greater equity in society at large. For example:
  actor --&gt; actrish
  writer --&gt; writrish
  runner --&gt; runnrish

Some studies say that the vowel length is an indicator of voice, while others claim that the vowel's duration indicates fortis/lenis. For instance, it could be said that the vowel in *sad* is longer than in *sat* because *sad* ends on a voiced consonant.  However, other studies claim that the *a* in *sad* is longer because it's followed by a lenis consonant.

linguistics,"Chinese Characters and ""Amnesia""","I found this paper [http://fusehime.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/eastasia/e/activity/images/SAITO%20Mareshi](http://fusehime.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/eastasia/e/activity/images/SAITO%20Mareshi) from Mareshi Saito (齋藤希史) who seems to suggest that Chinese characters were only able to spread so far because other people would change their function a lot from their previous use. They would “erase” the previous use of them – hence, “amnesia” which Saito uses a lot. Let me just tell you, I had a very hard time understanding this.

Something he said that I thought quite interesting is that he said that the oracle bone scriptures are qualitatively different from what we know as ‘Chinese characters’ today, are are in a sense ‘Pre-Chinese characters’. Yes, their geographical roots are from China, but Saito seems to see that as a coincidence and did not have that same cultural power. They were acts of divination as opposed to scripts used for communication in the everyday world. Seems like a distinction of semantics to me, but I get his point.

Saito then says that the 士 class of people in China were critical in making Chinese characters transcribable as a script of communication. I’m not really sure how true that is, and frankly I’m not even sure I understand what he’s saying.

Another thing Saito says is that Japan and Korea’s encounter with Chinese characters allowed them to define their ‘national’ (I use this word loosely) identity, and uses them to fit their own vernacular in a way that bares little resemblance to the literary Chinese tradition.

""...[in the North], only one language prevailed, although later it was split up into many vernaculars by the Slavs, the Hungarians, the Teutons, the Saxons, the English, and several other nations. Only one sign of their common origin remains in almost all of them, namely that nearly all the nations listed above, when they answer in the affirmative, say iò.""

Obviously the point of ancient vernaculars is that they were not diligently recorded, as Dante pioneered this, but it seems implausible that Slavonic, English, and Hungarian would all have the same word for ""yes"". Maybe there was some ancient sprachbund, but even then, there could but have been such extensive contact between all the ""barbarian"" tribes across Europe 1000 years ago that they would have settled on a common word for ""yes,"" right? Especially as Dante goes on to delineate the 3 Romantic offshoots of vulgar Latin as characterized by different expressions for ""yes""...

Anyway, I thought Dante's treatment of the topic was certainly interesting, but he is unable to go into any more detail about Northern European languages, so hopefully someone here knows something about medieval vernacular sprachbunds...

linguistics,Cha versus Tea in Hiberno-English.,"Hello all,

Coming from Ireland, I generally call tea 'tea', as most English speakers do, but there is a phrase that I assume is fossilized, 'cup of cha'. 

I don't referr to tea as cha, when talking about the plant, leaves or tea bags, but if I'm asking some one what they want, I usually say 'cup of cha?'. Generally it comes out as /kʌp.pæ tʃæ↗️/.

Cha is not used in the Irish language, it's /te/. And it's not just me, it's pretty much every Irish person I know. Can any other's here back me up? Is it just Munster?

linguistics,"Something curious about ""Bouba-Kiki"" effect and Jorge Luis Borges","I was reading a wikipedia paragraph about ""Bouba-Kiki"" effect and noticed/concluded something

The article:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideasthesia#In_normal_perception

Also a cool video by Tom Scott [Which Is ""Bouba"", and Which Is ""Kiki""?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TDIAObsqcs)

&gt;[Over the past decade, it has been suggested that the Bouba/Kiki phenomenon is a case of ideasthesia.[16][17][18] Most people will agree that the star-shaped object on the left is named Kiki and the round one on the right Bouba.[19][20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideasthesia#In_normal_perception) *It has been assumed that these associations come from direct connections between visual and auditory cortices.[20]* (...) *However, Gomez et al.[16][21] have shown that Kiki/Bouba associations are much richer as either word and either image is associated semantically to a number of concepts such as* **white or black color, feminine vs. masculine, cold vs. hot,** *and others. These sound-shape associations seem to be related through a large overlap between semantic networks of Kiki and star-shape on one hand, and Bouba and round-shape on the other hand.* (...) *In other words, our sensory experience is largely determined by the meaning that we assign to stimuli.*

It's not mentioned but I noticed those things:

1. All properties of those 2 objects are **different** and **polar opposites** of each other.

2. All properties of those 2 objects are **correlated**. They are equivalent or caused by each other (probably)

And from that possibly follows:

- This ""semantic network"" should operate on a changing [feature space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)) (space of properties). Otherwise it wouldn't be able to encode more than those 2 objects or use all those features (properties) in a different context or would be just a really inefficient encoding. Just really think about it considering the points above

- Speaking simpler: all those properties of Bouba and Kiki are **polar opposites** and **correlated** — but only in a certain context

Did anybody try to give it a second thought or model it?

It looks very suspicious for me, because on the surface it doesn't look like an efficient encoding of information (you have a bunch of properties that mean the same thing)

Unless something very interesting is hiding behind it!

**P.S.:** an analogy to explain my confusion... this ""rich semantic network"" looks like a single [bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) that can only (it seems) encode ""1"" and ""0"" (2 oppostie things)... but that's absurd, so that's strange and interesting!

**How do those associations work with more than 2 objects?** - that is my question essentially. If there were experiments (similar to Gomez at al.) with **3** or more names/objects it would be extremely interesting, but I don't see too much experiments with more than **2** objects (only [the study Tom Scott mentions](https://youtu.be/1TDIAObsqcs?t=53)).

***

**Jorge Luis Borges**

In [Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tl%C3%B6n,_Uqbar,_Orbis_Tertius#Part_two) Borges describes very interesting languages without objects (without nouns)

&gt; **The noun is formed by an accumulation of adjectives.** They do not say ""moon,"" but rather ""round airy-light on dark"" or ""pale-orange-of-the-sky"" or any other such combination. In the example selected the mass of adjectives refers to a real object, but this is purely fortuitous. The literature of this hemisphere (like Meinong's subsistent world) abounds in *ideal objects, which are convoked and dissolved in a moment, according to poetic needs. At times they are determined by mere simultaneity. There are objects composed of two terms, one of visual and another of auditory character:* the color of the rising sun and the faraway cry of a bird. 

I have two points:

1. [Bouba and Kiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideasthesia#In_normal_perception) are actually examples of objects created by ""accumulation of adjectives"" (white/black + cold/hot + feminine/masculine + etc.). They are also examples of objects created of terms of different character (visual and tactile for example)

2. What Borges describes is similar to synesthesia/ideasthesia in general

I think if study of Gomez et al. is true Borges should be credited for a lingustic/cognitive science discovery, because it would mean he predicted the correct interpretation of Bouba/Kiki phenomenon...

Has anybody pointed out that connection?

linguistics,Is English special for inadvertently choosing the 'wrong' word for things that changed later? or is this common? (Spanish native perspective),"Spanish is my first language and there's a lot of simple words in Spanish that feel like someone sat down and thought up a new word on purpose to make it distinct from other words, whereas in English there's a lot of words or phrases that seem to have just been made up of multiple words or a specific description of the item that really has nothing to do with the essence of the meaning of the item. Is this unique to English? I know German joins words all the time to, but as far as I've seen it doesn't suffer from the specific descriptor problem. I think I may also be biased from the region in the US I live in and the place i learned Spanish, there are words in english that fix these problems, but people seem content to just fumble their way through conversation with the wrong/not as precise word.

It might be hard to follow my train of thought here so here is a few examples:

In Spanish a drinking container is a 'copa' or 'vaso' both of which are just a container. I don't think there's a scenario where those words would become 'wrong'. In english a drinking container is a cup or a glass; cup is fine for a cup of water or soda, most people use glass instead even when it's plastic, which even native speakers notice sometimes and chuckle at it. That might be petty, but there's some instances where there doesn't seem to be a good word to use instead. A plastic glass of water is a water cup, but what is a plastic wine glass? I've stumped more than a few native speakers with that one. Same with silverware. Flatware is a perfectly good word but i literally had a lady this week ask me  ""do you need any plastic silverware? plastic fork... knife?"" This seemed odd to me, i don't sound or look foreign, there's no reason to explain what plastic silverware is, even though the word ""flatware"" is out there there are plenty of people content to go on a journey of material re-design and linguistic description rather than use a different word. I'm exaggerating of course, it was 6 words vs 2, but i'm just wondering if spanish is unique for being clear and not leaning on the material of the item you're describing, if english is unique for being a mess about this (i know it's a mess in many other ways) or if it's just my perspective.",1604037673,lookoutneit,9

I had never heard anyone else pronounce the word like this. I also heard an actor from that crappy show “young Sheldon” pronounce it as such too. I was curious, so I decided to some research. Upon looking at forum posts about it, people had mixed answers on what they thought the pronunciation was. Some people said that people only said “wahnt” while others said that they had only heard “wuhnt”. Because of this confusion, I made a survey to try and figure out if this strange pronunciation is based on a regional dialect or not.

If you guys have any insight, want to do my survey, or want to give me critique on my survey, go ahead. I will accept any help. Sorry for the long paragraph, this is just a passion project for me.

In the early 2000s, [Shana Poplack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shana_Poplack) provided [corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_linguistics)\-based evidence[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPoplack2000?-9)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPoplackTagliamonte2001?-10)—evidence from a body of writing—from isolated enclaves in [Samaná](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saman%C3%A1_Peninsula) and [Nova Scotia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Nova_Scotian_English) peopled by descendants of migrations of early AAVE-speaking groups (see [Samaná English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saman%C3%A1_English)) that suggests that the grammar of early AAVE was closer to that of contemporary British dialects than modern urban AAVE is to other current American dialects, suggesting that the modern language is a result of divergence from mainstream varieties, rather than the result of decreolization from a widespread American creole.""

linguistics,First Principle Reasoning,"&amp;#x200B;

For those who don't know what First principle reasoning is, the idea is to break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up.

**An example of first principle reasoning from Elon Musk:**

&gt;After visiting a number of aerospace manufacturers around the world, Musk discovered the cost of purchasing a rocket was astronomical—up to $65 million. Given the high price, he began to rethink the problem.  
“I tend to approach things from a physics framework,” Musk said in an interview. “Physics teaches you to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. So I said, okay, let’s look at the first principles. **What is a rocket made of?** Aerospace-grade aluminum alloys, plus some titanium, copper, and carbon fiber. Then I asked, what is the value of those materials on the commodity market? It turned out that the materials cost of a rocket was around two percent of the typical price.”  
Instead of buying a finished rocket for tens of millions, Musk decided to create his own company, purchase the raw materials for cheap, and build the rockets himself. SpaceX was born.

**So, what types of problem do you think can always be solved by using first principle reasoning and what type of problems cannot - like what's the best movie on Netflix?**

linguistics,Does Mandarin Chinese have room for nonsense words?,"I am a native English speaker. When I was little, before I knew how to read, I had a set of magnetic letters and I would put random ones together and ask my parents what word they made. More often than not, they didn't make any word that was even pronounceable. But even when they made something that could be spoken, usually the word didn't mean anything. Expanding this idea to spoken language, it would also be true that more often than not, any string of phonemes put together in ways that were valid for English would also result in non-words. It seems to me that this would be different in Mandarin, however. Is it true that the hit rate for preexisting words would be much higher due to the more limited rules for syllabic construction?

Assuming this premise is correct, I was curious to know if any of Mandarin's syllables or combinations thereof were spared for use as ""nonsense"" or ""made up"" words in productive (or non-productive) Mandarin.

Using English as the example, what I mean by nonsense words can be captured nicely by James Joyce's *Finnegan's Wake* and Lewis Carrol's *Jabberwocky*. Both are full of words that aren't/weren't in use in English but that do follow the rules of English word construction (they aren't difficult to say), some of which are now productive in English (like ""chortle"" from Jabberwocky) and most of which are not. I came across a definition of this type of language use, which I like, called [nonce words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonce_word).

Are nonsense and nonce words possible, either in speech or writing, in Mandarin? For speech, it seems like Mandarin's relatively small inventory of syllables would make that tough to come about in the same way as in English. For example, ""chortle"" seems like a combination of the words ""chuckle"" and ""snort"". Is there flexiblity for that in Mandarin? For written language, Mandarin's logosyllabic writing system seems like it would make construction of novel words difficult (especially because characters are tied not just to syllabic pronunciation but to meaning as well). 

If these possibilities are indeed limited, what kinds of creative language use is exhibited in Mandarin (or in other languages with similar properties)?",1603804756,TheJoo52,11

linguistics,Any examples of allophony triggered by lexical category of following or preceding word.,"Right now I am writing a chapter in my dissertation where I argue against the idea that there is a null verb Zulu non-verbal stative predication. One argument for assuming a verb is that some morphemes, namely one of the negative markers -nga-, and the ""persistive"" marker -sa- (meaning ""still"" , or ""anymore"" in negative contexts), change their vowel from a to e when they precede a non-verb, as in ""ngisemuhle"" ""I am still beautiful"", where ngi- is the 1st person singular marker, and muhle is the adjective beautiful. The more or less standard analysis for this (at least for linguists from South Africa) has been that there is a null verb in the example above between -se-/-sa- and muhle, which is (depending on the particular analysis) -li-, -i-, or -e-, and this merges with -sa- and therefore -sa- becomes -se-. The same thing happens with -nga-: ""ngingemuhle"" ""while I am not beautiful"". One argument for this particular analysis is that -nga- can appear before -sa-, and then only -sa- is changed, as in ""ngingasemuhle"" ""I am not beautiful anymore.""

So my own analysis is readjustment akin to distributed morphology, the rule in DM used for things like irregular verbs. Here I say that nga and sa change in the context of them preceding a non-verb. People might think selection might be another option, but I assume several functional categories in between (in particular) the negative marker and the predicate, so that is not as attractive (although other people have described it as (indirect) selection). But most examples of readjustment are things like irregular verbs, and I am looking for things that are as similar as possible to the Zulu data. 

So what I am looking for is a morpheme whose form is dependent on the category of the word preceding or following it. A hypothetical example would be a language that has case marking, but not case agreement on adjectives, so ""for the good man"" would be ""good man-dat"", but if the noun is elided, as in ""for the good one"" the dative case marker would attach to the adjective (""good-dat""), and the form of the case marker would be different. There are a few things that I found that are somewhat similar to these Zulu data, but I am looking for more examples. These are the things that I found:

1. In Zulu itself there is some morphology that is dependent on the category of whatever it follows, like locative markers, which are e-ni for most nouns, but ku- for non-nouns. However, in all of these cases the form used for non-nouns is also used for many nouns as well, and is better explained as the default form.
2. Closest is probably Swahili, which has different subject agreement for noun class 1 depending on whether it is verbal or non-verbal predication. But I am not sure what happens if something is in between the subject agreement and the predicate.
3. In Basque, the form of the case marker is dependent on a lot of factors, including on whether it attaches to a noun or a quantifier (which follows nouns). However, as with the Zulu locative, the data are quite complex, and sometimes nouns can have the ""quantifier"" case marking as well. That said, I did found a paper that described some of the variation with readjustment.
4. In Hungarian, the plural marker is normally -k, but if you have an independent possessive (""the ones of Peter"") you use -i. This might be explained by selection though (that is, there are two plural markers, -k selecting nouns, and -i selecting independent possessives, although an argument for readjustment is that -i is also used with nouns if they have a possessive marker, although that also opens the window to a more syntactic analysis)

So does anybody have any other examples? Note that I don't think the different case marking on adjectives and nouns in conservative Germanic languages count, as the case marking on adjectives is better explained as agreement in case with the noun, rather than the case marker itself.",1603798409,merijn2,6

linguistics,"An interesting article about the ""hidden truth"" of Standard Chinese on the wikipedia talk page. I'd like to hear what the experts here think.","&gt;It is extremely difficult for me to find anything in this article with which I would agree.

&gt;The most serious problem is that it fails to recognise the essentially 'artificial' nature of Modern Standard Chinese. MSC phonology was constructed by meetings of Han Chinese intellectuals, whose sole aim was to allocate to each Chinese character a certain pronunciation. Little work was done on the phonemic construction of these syllables, although the theory put forward with the publication of the Zhuyin Zimu in 1914 was far ahead of anything which has appeared since (that Chinese syllables contain a maximum of four phonemes: initial, medial, final and tone.)

&gt;Nothing in this article mentions the problem of stitching these syllables together. It's not mentioned anywhere else, to my knowledge. After one year studying Chinese I concluded that what I had learnt was not a proper language at all. I think many people studying Chinese come quickly to form this view, although they may be unable to articulate it. They just give up in disgust.

&gt;Without discussing this problem, this article is in no way adequate as a description of Chinese phonology.

&gt;Actual syllables of spoken MSC do not coincide with the phonemic syllables of each character. The boundaries are different, and intrusive sounds are added. It seems that nobody ever saw this problem: they thought it sufficient to join syllables according to the rules of their native speech. (Actually, they probably never even realised that such rules existed.)

&gt;For this reason there is, from a 'descriptive' viewpoint, no such thing as MSC phonology. There are no rules, because everybody invents their own rules. There are no phonemes, because everyone has their own way of constructing syllables.

&gt;MSC is a delusion resting upon a delusion. The first delusion was that there existed a distinct ethnic group known as the Han. The second was to believe that 'Mandarin' was the common language of the Han, even though perhaps only one person in 1000 actually spoke it.

&gt;No thought was given to the people who had created 'Mandarin' Version 1911, as these people were mostly not Han Chinese but rather Manchus.

&gt;It was the Manchus who forced the final acceptance of refined Beijing speech as the accepted language of the Court, over the heads of those Han officials who hung on to the Jianghuai Mandarin imported from Nanjing.

&gt;This article makes frequent unnecessary reference to the history of the Chinese language. This is a breach of the most important rule underlying linguistics: that a (synchronic)description of a language should not make reference to its history, except where absolutely necessary.

&gt;A knowledge of a Chinese 'dialect' such as Cantonese leads one to an understanding that syllables [an], [ang], [am] and [ap] each consist of two phonemes. This can lead one to believe that MSC syllables [an] and [ang] also consist of two phonemes. Free of this prejudice there is no reason to believe that [an] is anything but a single phoneme, just as [ao] also forms one singe phoneme. MSC has seven phonemes of this type, consisting of a vowel plus a nasal. This point was understood in 1914 when Zhuyin Zimu was published, but now it is forgotten.

&gt;Seeing MSC through the lens of different 'dialects' is essentially the same error as confusion between synchronic and historical linguistics.

&gt;To describe the phonology of an artificial language, a phonology which has never been fully decided, may be greatly interesting to some linguists, but it is scarcely helpful to any person who wishes to learn Chinese. Although it is awful to the ears of many linguists, a prescriptive account, based on the Chinese spoken by Manchu officials in 1911, would be more useful.

&gt;Linguists, naturally enough, describe linguistics as 'the' study of language. This is doubly untrue. Linguistics deals with certain aspects of language and not others; other disciplines study language, including aspects which linguistics ignores.

&gt;It seems that the notion of ""good speech habits"" is quite foreign to linguists. It's easy to sum up. Good speech habits produce speech which is clear (i.e. distinctions are marked), elegant (i.e. pleasant to listen to), and sonorous (i.e. loud), all while requiring little physical or mental effort.

&gt;To my knowledge, to this day, no person has ever acquired fame as a model of good Chinese speech. As far as I am aware the notion of 'good speech habits' is unknown among the Chinese. State broadcasting authorities seem, about once each decade, to come up with a new fad, but these ideas never catch on. The way Chinese is spoken by CCTV newsreaders only makes people laugh or sneer.

&gt;Those who sought to create this artificial language never produced a complete draft proposition of what MSC phonology should be. The result is that all people who use this language are in the dark about what steps one would take to improve one's speech.

&gt;I obtained 17 recordings of short essays from Zhongguo Chuanmei Daxue (Chinese Media University) thinking that these would surely tell me what Chinese experts considered to be elegant speech. Of these 17, only four pieces were not accompanied by music! This I believe is typical of the contempt which most Chinese people show toward the spoken word. The blame must ultimately go to linguists.

&gt;Careful study of MSC phonology can allow linguists to reconstruct 'Mandarin' as spoken in 1911 by the Manchus. I personally am especially fortunate as I have heard this form of speech, on one single occasion. It was astoundingly beautiful, and something which I can never forget.

&gt;I believe that the path which I have suggested is the only viable way forward.

A follow up on the user's profile, entitled: ""This may be the only article in English on the Net which comes near the truth about the Chinese language""

&gt;Lower Yangtze Mandarin, also known as Southern Mandarin, was the lingua franca of Chinese administration throughout the Ming and through most of the Qing dynasties. It was not, however, replaced by Beijing Dialect. Rather, it was replaced by Northern Mandarin. Northern Mandarin had been the lingua franca of the Manchu Empire, but had never been spoken in China.

&gt;Some sources tell us that Southern Mandarin changed into Northern Mandarin under the influence of Beijing Dialect. That would be impossible, as the phonological bases of these two languages are quite distinct.

&gt;Northern Mandarin became the official language of China in 1870 entirely because of insistence by a Manchu-led government, but it took them 200 years of effort.

&gt;In 47 years I have heard excellent Northern Mandarin spoken 'live' by a Manchu on one occasion only. Han Chinese refuse to speaks this way, despite its simplicity and extraordinary beauty. (In the 1970s Hong Kong Mandarin films were all dubbed by Manchus, but it seems that nobody took the hint.)

&gt;I can only conclude that, since 1644, Han Chinese within the Great Wall have been at war with Northern Mandarin. Everything I read on the Net and elsewhere indicates that this war continues, but there will be no happy ending.

&gt;Chinese people are being led to believe that Northern Mandarin came out of Southern Mandarin, so therefore it can be turned ""back"" into Southern Mandarin. Can you turn a cat ""back"" into a dog?

&gt;These were two distinct languages, existing at the same time. Any attempt to turn Northern Mandarin ""back"" into Southern Mandarin can only result in fragmentation and destruction of China's lingua franca. Already these attempts have had a catastrophic effect, making Chinese an almost unlearnable sea of extremely ugly idiolects.

&gt;Despite the terrible standard of pronunciation heard everywhere in China today, careful study of a chart of Hanyu Pinyin readings clearly indicates the Northern Mandarin which underlies this system of spelling. To those who have studied phonology it is evident that spellings j,q, and x are inventions by Southerners, and cannot possibly represent distinct phonemes. (""No minimal pairs!"")

&gt;This explains why, for twenty years or more, Beijing-based 国际书店 was spelt Guozi Shudian, and not Guoji Shudian. For those who speak relatively good Mandarin 'j' simply does not exist. In good Northern Mandarin 'x' is pronounced exactly as [s].

&gt;I would urge anyone who wishes to study Chinese not to do so. For those who have spent much of their lives on such a project, I would advise them to show zero patience toward Southerners who wish to change Northern Mandarin ""back"" into a southern Chinese language. It's not their language, and it's absolutely none of their business.

&gt;Anyone who takes their ideas seriously is making a lot of trouble for themselves. Would they follow the advice of an ignorant German or Russian on how to speak good French?

&gt;China Daily recognises that good Putonghua is spoken only in Luanping. This town lies outside the Great Wall, and all residents are descended from Manchu loyalists of the Yellow Banner.

linguistics,Comprehensive explanation of phonemicity and allophony?,"Pretty much the title. I have recently got into phonology, and have tried asking about the phonemicity of phones in different languages. But I am now more confused as to what constitutes a phoneme. Here's what I think I understand. It is not a binary. You can have sounds that are not quite a phoneme, but not purely an allophone either (but I don't know how this works). A sound can be a phone because of the phonological environment, and thus not necessarily need minimal pairs (though I don't fully understand this, either). I know phonemes may be allophones for other phonemes.

That being said, can somebody give me a comprehensive explanation of how it works, what are the different criteria, what are the different relationships phones can have to each other? I would appreciate real world examples of the more complex cases.

For context, some of the examples I was confused about:

English nasalization in some dialects: &lt;honor&gt; [ʔɑ̃ɾ̃ɹ̃] vs &lt;otter&gt; [ʔaɾɹ]. Technically, a minimal pair, but still just allophones of /n/ and /t/ respectively?

Tamil voicing. Pronouncing a consonant with the wrong voicing sounds *wrong*, not just weird. But, there are still very few minimal pairs (if any, depending on dialect). Is this just a stage on the path towards developing phonemic voicing?

linguistics,"Does your language use a causative (let, make, get) to form pretensives or imitatives (pretend to X, act like an X)?","In Madurese, a Malayo-Polynesian language I'm studying, you get a 'pretend to X' (pretensive/imitative) meaning by reduplicating a causative stem (reduplication copies the final syllable of the root - *labu* in this example) :

labu 'fall'
pa-labu 'cause to fall'
bu-pa-labu 'pretend to fall' (also cause to fall plural)

There is also a similar imitative in nouns, formed by adding the nominalising suffix *-an* and reduplicating: 

roma 'house' 
ma'-roma-'an 'toy house'

linguistics,"What would it look like if you wrote a sentence in English, but using your native language's original sentence structure?","This question was originally posted by [u/TimArthurScifiWriter](https://www.reddit.com/user/TimArthurScifiWriter/) on [r/AskEurope](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEurope/), so full credit goes to him. I thought it was too good and fun of a question, not to share on a bigger subreddit also!

Here's my take own take on it:

&amp;#x200B;

**From Danish to English, version 1 (every word translated directly, but not in a confusing way):**

I have written this message on Danish first, and so translated each word to English for, so widely as possible, to preserve the words original placement in relationship to each other. I joys me to to see what the outcome of this little linguistic experiment becomes, when I once get translated these words.

Such a good and fun idea you have gotten OP! It is enormously entertaining to read they others comments in the thread, and cool to get an insight in how other people naturally structure their sentences.

Bothered know which influence it has on our individuel worldview, that we perceive language so different from each other.

&amp;#x200B;

**From Danish to English, version 2 (every word translated directly, but in a more confusing and comical way):**

I have written this message on Danish first, and so over-put every word to English for, so widely as possible, to conserve the words original placement in for-hold to each other. I joys me to to see what the out-fall of this small language-straight experiment stays, reaches I one-walk sheep over-put these words.

Such one good and funny idea you have received OP! That is enormously under-holding to read they others comments in the thread, and fat to recieve one inside-aim in how other humans natural structure theirs sentences.

Bothered know which inside-flow that has on ours individuel world-sight, to we up-understand language so different from each other.

&amp;#x200B;

**The original message in Danish:**

Jeg har skrevet denne besked på dansk først, og så oversat hvert ord til engelsk for, så vidt som muligt, at bevare ordenes originale placering i forhold til hinanden. Jeg glæder mig til at se hvad udfaldet af dette lille sproglige eksperiment bliver, når jeg engang får oversat disse ord.

Sikke en god og sjov idé du har fået OP! Det er enormt underholdende at læse de andres kommentarer i tråden, og fedt at få en indsigt i hvordan andre mennesker naturligt strukturerer deres sætninger.

Gad vide hvilken indflydelse det har på vores individuelle verdenssyn, at vi opfatter sprog så forskelligt fra hinanden.

&amp;#x200B;

**How I would translate the original message:**

I have written this message in Danish first and then translated each word into English so that I, as much as possible, keep every word's original placement in relation to each other. I'm looking forward to seeing what the outcome of this little linguistic experiment will be, once I have translated these words.

What a good and fun idea you have had OP! Reading everyone's comments in the thread is really entertaining, and getting an insight into other peoples natural way of structuring sentences is pretty cool.

linguistics,My father changed his accent from Pakistani -&gt; London English -&gt; Canadian as an adult?,"Hey all, I've always thought it was so interesting how my father had changing accents over his life as an ADULT. 

My dad grew up in with English as his first language in a Goan Pakistani, going to boarding school in Lahore and more or less living in Pakistan until 18 (he also spoke Urdu, but much less so now).

At 18, he moved to England where he tells me he noticed that as a survival method he learned the ""British English"" accent that was used in London during the 60's. He lived there for 10 years, and apparently was literally undetectable from another English person based on his accent.

At 28, he moved to Canada, where I think the most surprising change occurred at such a later age, he gained a Canadian accent fairly quickly I believe, videos of him in the 80's show a slight English accent but 85% Canadian. Most of my life 93-present day, he has sounded completely Canadian. He even likes to troll people over the phone pretending to be a white guy (no offense!). 

Anyway just wanted to see if anyone feels they may have an understanding as to how he did this? I feel like from his explanations it was never actually conscious, he just adapted. Which I find really amazing, I had a friend he moved at age 7 and still retains their original accent to some extent.",1603467267,jomommaz,1
linguistics,Are there any levels of sentence analysis (broad/narrow etc)?,"Are there any levels of sentence analysis? 

For example:
&gt; Which perfume are you using?

I know only one way to analyse (parse?) this sentence:
""Which"" is a determiner, ""perfume"" is the object, ""are"" is auxiliary, ""you"" is the subject and ""using"" is the main verb. 

I have seen different analyses, but I don't know any. 

In Phonetics, there are many ways to transcribe a word/sentence. For example, the word ""enlighten"" can be transcribed **[ɪnˈlaɪt(ə)n]**, but if I get a bit narrower, it becomes **[ɪnˈlaɪt̚n̩]**. I can further narrow it down to **[ɪ̃nˈlaɪ̯t̚n̩]**. It's just an example of how many levels of transcription we have in Phonetics. 

Like the Phonetics transcription, are there grammatical levels of sentence analysis? Like broad analysis and then narrow and then narrowest etc? Do they have names? How do I know them? Can anyone give some insight please?

linguistics,Do all languages have words that don't actually mean anything which they just include in their sentences when they speak?,"In my country (Philippines), Tagalog speakers use ""eh"" in some of their sentences but ""eh"" on its own does not mean anything.

But people still include the ""eh"" part when talking.  


Another example is also from my country but with another language. In Bisaya, people use the word ""gud"". It's for emphasis but it doesn't really HAVE to be there nor does it mean anything.

linguistics,Speaking and thinking only in 3rd person.,"Hi,

OP have had this idea for a long time of changing current languages by using only 3rd person to speak and think. This post is designed to be an example. English is not OP's native language, it's French (where these rules also apply), but English is the language of the internet and science so that's why OP chose r/Linguistics to discuss the topic.

TL;DR: OP develops the reasons and benefits to only speak in the 3rd person and ask for opinions and/or further reading on the subject. Speaking this way supposedly helps to significantly improve one's behavior and way of thinking through more mindfulness and awareness of the rest of humanity/life.

&amp;#x200B;

OP have heard some buddhist monks saying ""In emptiness, there is no I, the creator of negative karma, no action of creating negative karma, and no negative karma created"". Emptiness is the stuff one is trying to fully realise before being able to reach enlightment (or awakening), and in the end nirvana (concept as famous as karma). But enough of buddhist theories! 

When one thinks about this sentence, it is a clear and simple guideline to ethics, to what is wrong and what right. For millenniums human has created rules and law primarly to avoid and punish bad behaviors. And what clearly makes a bad behavior if it's not a behavior that benefits some people but not the majority of a community/tribe?

&amp;#x200B;

Thinking about oneself is completely natural as who is going to take better care of oneself if not the person him/herself? The issue here might be the way human formulates it in its mind. By thinking 'I', one focuses a lot on him/herself whithout really being mindful about it. It goes to a point where some people end up only thinking/talking about themselves and ending acting in a ""bad"" way because their actions do not benefit at all to the rest of their community.

&amp;#x200B;

To speak about oneself without using the first person makes the person realise how frequently his/her interest are put before the interests of others. For example someone called Chad talks to a relative called Stacy and says ""I need this"" and ""I like that"". If instead Chad says ""Chad needs this"" and ""Chad likes that"" he is clearly aware of the fact that it's only Chad that needs this and likes that. By saying to Stacy those sentences, Chad keeps in mind that Stacy might too have needs or like something completely different. Speaking only in 3rd person becomes a very efficient way to be constantly being mindful of the rest of one's community, and in a certain way, life in it's all. When Chad thinks ""Chad needs to cut a tree to get warm during the winter"", Chad is going to cut the tree but the chances Chad realise he is killing a life for his benefits is much higher than if he used 'I' and probalities that he will only use the minimum amount ouf wood increase. When one think and speak using its name, his/her name becomes one name in the middle of other names surrounding it. The special power and needs that comes with the 'I' disapear. 

&amp;#x200B;

To understand better, one can try right now to say out loud ""I'm reading this guy boring monologue"". Now if he/she says ""'one's name' is reading this guy boring monologue"", the feeling of equality between OP and him/her suddenly increase, along with respect and will to continu to read. What is funny is that if someone start to entirely avoid 1st and 2nd person one becomes aware of how frequently one talks about him/her. If Chad lives with Stacy and Chad constantly talks about Chad, at some point Stacy is more encline to say ""well it's all about Chad and never about Stacy"". People talking mainly about themselves get spotted easily and become more isolated and start to change because a name pops way more in the mind than a 'I' that anyone use all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the 'us'. 'Us' is also a special become it's 'us' against 'you'. It is division, it is ""we feel more important than you"". ""We"" brings people together, which is good, but it is necessary together against the others and finally the rest of the humanity. Therefore 'we' generates also division.

&amp;#x200B;

What about the 'you'? Well it exists only in reaction to the 'I' and 'we'. 'you' generates special treatment and lower mindfulness the same way 'I' and 'we' do.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now that readers get the idea, OP can share the pros and cons:

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

&amp;#x200B;

\-People talk and think less about themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

\-In 2020 almost the majority of humanity (3 billions) is bringing a smartphone everywhere, allowing to be connected instantly to these 3 billions people. The number is growing everyday and humanity is pursuing its impressive interconnection. Shifting to use of language that makes people more aware of other people could only be positive in that sense.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Its responsability in the climat change is one of the biggest challenge humanity is currently facing for its survival. Uniting humanity has become essential to answer all urgent issues related to climate. Using only 3rd person could help humanity to get awareness of other forms of life in its ecosytem. Moreover scientists conviced billionnaires to invest in research (see Breakthrough Listen) because there are now high probabilities that intelligent forms of life exist somewhere in the universe and it's worth putting hundreds of millions to find them. If someday humannity finds intelligent life outside of mother Earth it might be important for it to introduce itself as a responsible and united species taking care of itself as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Languages easier to learn for non-speaker.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Easier than learning a complete new language based on this idea (and others that could be beneficial).

&amp;#x200B;

\-Tendency to ask more for people's name and memorize them because it's often necessary to speak to them in a way that is not too formal.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Language and possibilities to think get poorer. Yeah, but one can argue it's for a 'good' cause. Also owners of the media tend to push people to use less and less words. Moreover the fact that people buy less and less books that could make their language richer is a proof that generally speaking they prefers to spend their time and energy doing something else.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Difficulties to start to change, specially for conservatives and/or edderly people for whom it's too late to restart to learn to speak. Changing drasticaly the way of speaking is more and more difficult the more you get older. The positive side is that young adults/parents have better capacities to reshape their way of speaking if they feel it's to improve themselves and the world. It's possible to get children growing only speaking with 3rd person in the next decades.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Division in society between people embrassing this and people against it. The trick is to start to only use it with relatives until they get use to it and feel the benefits (or not). At the same time one can continu to speak ""the old way"" with strangers or relatives pissed off by this. Over the time if it's really beneficial there should be a shift where a majority of people use it and it becomes the norm.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Energy spent to switch in different circumstances between the ""new"" way to speak and the ""older"" during years (probably decades) the time it gets mainstream.

&amp;#x200B;

\-When a name is forgotten it's difficult to hide it!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

OP would like to receives remarks and critics on this idea. If there are authors (not too difficult to read) who already discussed the subject OP'd be glad to learn about them!

linguistics,Size/crowding of vowel inventory affecting free variation in vowel system?,"Hiya peeps! So I've observed anecdotally in comparing languages with 5 vowel systems (namely European Spanish and modern 
Greek) with those with 7 vowel systems (Standard Italian) that the high vowels, particularly /i/, seem to have a greater range of realizations in the former two languages than in the latter. I've tried reading papers on the vowel systems of these languages in particular but those didn't reveal anything, as it seems to me that the prototypical realization of /i/ is more or less the same in all of these languages. What I'm interested in are instances I've observed where a Greek or Spanish speaker is articulating /i/ in a more 'relaxed' way and it sounds lowered enough that it could be mistaken for a high mid /e/ by an Italian speaker, but is still fully distinct from the true mid~low mid /e/ of Spanish and Greek. In the same vein, when I've spoken modern Greek I've been told that I sounded more natural when my /i/ was a bit lower than how I usually pronounce it in Italian.

I've found a paper comparing mandarin and cantonese vowels where it showed that a more crowded vowel space doesn't seem to affect coarticulation of vowels, but I'm not looking for info on coarticulation so much as just free variation.

In that process, you find that there are Morphological similarities between their Nominative, Accusative and Ablative cases. You even find that several conjuncts and pronouns are similar to each other.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.metafilter.com/24721/Naom-Chomsky#464906](https://www.metafilter.com/24721/Naom-Chomsky#464906) 

OK, this is going to be long, but you asked for it. Here's the citation stavros quotes as the heart of the essay (with footnote numbers deleted):

&gt;Gore's now classic introduction to Webster's Third outlines this type of Descriptivism's five basic edicts: ""1--Language changes constantly; 2--Change is normal; 3--Spoken language is the language; 4--Correctness rests upon usage; 5--All usage is relative.""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;These principles look prima facie OK--commonsensical and couched in the bland simple s.-v.-o, prose of dispassionate Science--but in fact they're vague and muddled and it takes about three seconds to think of reasonable replies to each one of them, viz.:  
  
&gt;  
&gt;1--OK, but how much and how fast?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;2--Same thing. Is Heraclitean flux as normal or desirable as gradual change ? Do some changes actually serve the language's overall pizzazz better than others? And how many people have to deviate from how many conventions before we say the language has actually changed? Fifty percent? Ten percent?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;3--This is an old claim, at least as old as Plato's Phaedrus. And it's specious. If Derrida and the infamous Deconstructionists have done nothing else, they've debunked the idea that speech is language's primary instantiation. Plus consider the weird arrogance of Gove's (3) w/r/t correctness. Only the most mullahlike Prescriptivists care very much about spoken English; most Prescriptive usage guides concern Standard Written English.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;4--Fine, but whose usage? Gove's (4) begs the whole question. What he wants to imply here, I think, is a reversal of the traditional entailment-relation between abstract rules and concrete usage: Instead of usage ideally corresponding to a rigid set of regulations, the regulations ought to correspond to the way real people are actually using the language. Again, fine, but which people? Urban Latinos? Boston Brahmins? Rural Midwesterners? Appalachian Neogaelics?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;5--Huh? If this means what it seems to mean, then it ends up biting Gove's whole argument in the ass. (5) appears to imply that the correct answer to the above ""which people?"" is: ""All of them!"" And it's easy to show why this will not stand up as a lexicographical principle. The most obvious problem with it is that not everything can go in The Dictionary. Why not? Because you can't observe every last bit of every last native speaker's ""language behavior,"" and even if you could, the resultant dictionary would weigh 4 million pounds and have to be updated hourly. The fact is that any lexicographer is going to have to make choices about what gets in and what doesn't. And these choices are based on ... what? And now we're right back where we started. 

First off, I have a copy of Webster's *Third International*, and there's no such list; in fact, there's no Introduction, just a short Preface that doesn't discuss theoretical matters. But I don't want to be unfair; rather than assume DFW is making the whole thing up, I'll assume my printing is lacking the Introduction. So. Taking it from the top...

1: It doesn't matter how much and how fast. There's a range within which change generally occurs (hence the attempts at [**glottochronology**](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glottochronology), a controversial method of determining how long ago two languages diverged based on how many words are different), but external events (wars, migrations, etc.) can modify that. The only important point is what Gove said: languages change constantly. Let me repeat that: *constantly*. They never stand still. Hence, the prescriptivist ideal of freezing usage is moonshine.

2: Same answer, because Gove (if he is being quoted correctly) is basically restating the same thing to drive it into your head (as I did above). Change happens all the time, it is normal, end of story. DFW's ""response"" is just silly. Imagine it applied to planetary motion: ""Is Heraclitean flux as normal or desirable as gradual change ? Do some changes actually serve the solar system's overall pizzazz better than others? And how far does a planet have to move before we say its position has actually changed?""

3: Here I have particular doubts about the correctness of the quote. But if that's what Gove said, he meant ""Spoken language is the *primary* language""—the first one we learn and the one without which written language would not exist. Obviously the point is not that written language is unimportant or disposable, but rather that it must in some sense reflect the spoken language—it can't reproduce it exactly, but if it gets too far away from it, it becomes sterile and moribund (as happened to Modern Greek when it was still trying to pretend it was Ancient).

4: Whose usage? The usage of any native speaker. Sure, there are different groups of speakers, and all those DFW names (urban Latinos, Boston Brahmins, etc.) have their own standards, each of which is internally consistent and ""correct."" The question of what's ""correct"" in social terms is **entirely different**, and this is perhaps the most important point I can stress here. Linguistically, ""ain't"" is just as correct as ""isn't."" Socially, you will be looked down on for using the first, and this is something any decent teacher will stress. But that no more reflects scientific facts than the comparable fact that brown skin is looked down on reflects any inherent worthiness. People do not run their social lives on scientific principles, and probably never will.

5: Again, I wonder about the accuracy of the quote, and if it's accurate what exactly Gove meant by it. But the general idea is clear enough: what's correct in Bed-Stuy or Appalachia isn't correct in the ""best"" social circles. DFW's response is childish. Obviously ""not everything can go in The Dictionary""; choices have to be made, and they're made on the basis of what words and usages are widespread enough to be taken into account. A word used by a few inhabitants of a remote area can be left to the dialect dictionaries; one that turns up in novels, newspapers, or reasonably nontechnical science writing should be included. There will always be borderline cases. So what? None of this has anything to do with the theory, which is perfectly simple: usage means the way native speakers use their language, not what William Safire or DFW or any other maven decides is right.",1603195217,Hot_Paper9272,50

Our most recent episode published earlier this week was about the GIF pronunciation holy war, so I figured I'd post it on this subreddit (slight spoiler but the episode concludes by citing a linguistics researcher's work). This episode was a bit of a stretch as a ""cult"" maybe, but then again, stretching that definition is sort of the point of our show :D 

[**S2E15 - The Holy War**](https://www.cultorjustweird.com/podcast/episode/285379df/s2e15-the-holy-war) ... also is available to download/subscribe on any podcast platform.

Would love to hear your thoughts/feedback/criticism etc!

linguistics,Ancient linguistic questions,"This may be more historical than linguistic, but I'm wondering if people of the ancient world were aware of the links between their languages. Were greeks aware that persians were speaking a language which was related to theirs? What about romans to greeks? Did they note that their languages had more in common than latin did with coptic or the semetic languages? 

When I imagine a Roman learning greek, learning different names for the 'same' gods. I imagine them seeing their cultures as distant relatives, but I'm not sure if this is how they would discribe it. Would they maybe see similarities but not put together that there was a common ancester culture and language? Maybe just thinking that they were of more civilised cultures than the others. Ones which share language traits because of that?",1603059335,timmytissue,8

linguistics,How well supported is Sino-Tibetan?,"Hey everyone. I don't have expertise in this area at all and was wondering: how well supported is the Sino-Tibetan family? A user on another sub just claimed to me that ""It's not \[mainstream among linguists\]. There is absolutely no 'theory' of Sino-Tibetan like there is  of Indo-European, Uralic, or Semitic. What little theoretical work that  exists is similar to the so-called Altaic hypothesis and the  Uralic-Altaic hypothesis, both of which have finally been dropped by most linguists outside Russia (where, again, the hypotheses serve political interests)."" They also claimed that ""Tibeto-Burman and Sinitic do not show similarities in"" morphology, sound system, and syntax, that Kra-Dai and Hmong have been included for political reasons, and that they haven't seen ""significant progress"" in the theoretical work on Sino-Tibetan, which they call ""a hypothesis with anecdotal evidence, nothing more.""

linguistics,Help with southwest US cultural communication style,"I'm not sure this is the right sub, but this is a new subject for me. 

I'm originally from New Mexico and while I've moved around quite a bit, I've been back 3 times now and I consider it home. I haven't lived there for almost 10 years now, and almost everywhere I've lived since then has a sort of cultural ""freeze"". People are kind of standoffish, and it takes a while to even figure out if someone likes you or not. Now I'm smack in the middle of the upper midwest, and my number one complaint is that communicating here is really fucking hard. I guess it could be described as ""passive""- they won't tell you what they're thinking, they'll just sort of talk around their feelings or thoughts on something and only sort of allude to it. I'm not an aggressive communicator, but I try and be clear and upfront- I think the term here is ""assertive"". And when I'm visiting and/or I speak with people from NM- or really just about anywhere in the southwest US- I find that they're the same way. For all of the problems I had with NM when I lived there, knowing exactly what people are thinking when they're communicating is not one of them. Or, as I described to someone here in the midwest, ""when you walk into a room and there is someone in there that has a problem with you, you will know almost immediately"".

Anyone have any insight into this and/or recommended reading? Cultural communication styles for the region or something similar? I tried poking around google and google scholar (1 million results for ""Mexico"" and not ""New Mexico"", as is tradition), but it's not really being helpful, and the FAQ reading list is basically a textbook dump. I'm mostly curious because I'd like to understand where I come from a little better.",1603056031,Tota11y_Not_Russian,0

linguistics,Pronunciation of American English diphthongs /eɪ̯/ and /oʊ/,"**Disclaimer:** I am not a linguist. I studied some psycholinguistic during my MA in psychology, but everything I know is based on binge-reading Wikipedia and some open-access paper on google scholar. So basically I know nothing! If this is a silly question or if it needs to be posted somewhere else, I apologize!

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a native English speaker, I am Italian, but I've been living in Toronto for a while now. These two diphthongs have been driving me crazy. They are reported as /eɪ̯/ and /oʊ/, but I would like to know what their actual pronunciation is!  


**/eɪ̯/ --&gt;** To me, words like *play*, *say*, or *day* don't rhyme with words like *OK* or *gay*. The former, I hear as \[eɪ̯\] whereas the latter as something more towards \[ɛɪ̯\], although not as ""open"". For instance, to me, *play* is close to the Italian word *déi*  \[ˈd̪ei̯\]  (some), while *OK* is close to the Italian word ""Dèi"" \[ˈd̪ɛi̯\] (gods).

**/oʊ/ --&gt;** As for the other diphthong, I hear it pronounced differently in different words. For instance, in *no* or *window* I hear \[oʊ\], but in words like *don't*, I do not hear \[ doʊnt\] but a sound more towards \[ɔ\], something like \[do̞ʊnt\] or even \[do̞nt\] with no diphthong.

As I said,  English is not my native language and I might be hearing these words with a ""biased"" and untrained ear. However,  \[e\], \[ɛ\], \[o\], and \[ɔ\] are all existing sounds in the Italian vowel inventory, so I should be able to tell them apart.",1603033860,Ad_dan28,10

So u cross verify such words with their respective grammatical texts written in classical age. You find out that all of them follow rules laid out by those texts.

In that process, you find that there are Morphological similarities between their Nominative, Accusative and Ablative cases. You even find that several conjuncts and pronouns are similar to each other.

linguistics,“There learnt that” — dialect or one-off grammar mistake?,"Scuse me if this is the wrong sub and just send me someplace else. This has nagged me for years and I’m wondering if you guys know the answer.

Years ago I was working for a student paper at a college in rural Appalachia (southeast Ohio, to be specific),  and talked to a older man who ran a horse-mounted unit of officers, he was probably in his 70s and had a particular way of speaking. In describing to me the first time they used the horses for crowd control when drunk students were rioting in a street, which was and still sometimes is a regular occurrence there, he said the mounted officers formed a line and slowly cleared the street. (I saw this same thing happen a few times. Picture a medieval shield wall except with police horses and drunk students.) 

He said that after three times of the students regathering and the officers again clearing the street, “there learnt that.” He meant the students learned not to return because the wall of horses would clear them again.

I sort of intuitively knew what he meant, but my editor, of course, removed the quote because grammatically it “made no sense.” I’d figured it was a regional thing, but I guess so. 

Does anyone recognize that phrasing? Was he talking his own crazy person talk or was that a traceable dialect?

NARROW TRANSCRIPTION: 1. \[nʊ̜̑ʏ pʰe̯ɛ\] and the ones I prefer: 2. \[nʊ̜̑ʊ̙ pʰe̯e̞\] and sometimes even 3. \[nʊ̜̑ʊ̝\]

I'll now break down the narrow transcription ones a bit: 1. I've here used different phonemes in the diphthongs, which is why I call them diphthongs. However, I don't like this approach, as in my opinion it doesn't give the same idea

2. Here I have signaled that the latter FOOT sound is pronounced with advanced tongue root (more like /ʏ/), and that the latter /e/ is pronounced lowered (more like /ɛ/). I personally prefer this one, as it gives the right idea, but is this a diphthong

3. Sometimes the latter FOOT sound is pronounced as a semivowel version. I wanted to include this, as with this I am even more unsure than example 2: The latter FOOT isn't even a vowel anymore, but in the same time if 2 can be a diphthong, can this be as well, as it is still here marked as an allophone of FOOT?

  
Basically, the question is, can for ex. \[ʊ̜̑ʊ̙\], \[e̯e̞\] or \[ʊ̜̑ʊ̝\] be a diphthong, even while only includes a single phoneme? If not, what are these called? They shouldn't be monophtongs, as the sound does change? What are they called? Am I stupid? Who ate the last cookie out of the cookie jar?",1602790796,EdwardPavkki,5

linguistics,Our school lesson duration just got cut by half; I'm at a loss,"Apparently, during the spring lockdown, quite a few parents in my city have written tons of complaints about how their poor children spend all their school day by the computer wearing off their eyes and stuff. I should note that the graduation exams (kind of like SATs) were held regardless. In fact, they were even more difficult than usual.

Anywho, our mayor decided it was time for kids to stay at home once again. At first, he made the school break last one week longer, so an entire week of lessons just fell out. Now the department of education at out city has released an order to switch to distant education, with lessons NO LONGER THAN 25 minutes (instead of the usual 45).

I, a teacher of chemistry for pupils who specialize in medicine, am at a loss, because the idea is I should teach my students quite complex aspects of chemistry so that they had a chance to pass their graduation exams for chemistry as best as they can. Even though I have up to 7 lessons a week with some kids, we've still got quite a few things to do: 3 times a week we learn new material, which is usually me giving a lecture on some complex topic and answering what seems like a torrent of questions from my students; 2 times a week we recall information from previous years (this is their first year at our school, and it turns out there's quite a lot they don't remember), and 2 times a week we spend dealing with things that caused problem and misunderstanding during the former 5 hours. Even with 7 times a week, we often take some time from the break (with the students' approval) to neatly wrap up all we have learned.

Now it's just twice as little that time. I simply do not know what to do. The department's answer is ""give them something to read and learn by"". Well, from my experience, school pupils just don't digest information that well when they read it off the textbook. They think they understand the words and that's all that's needed. They don't internalize the information they read in a textbook, they don't spend time reading the same sentence over and over again until they see exactly why it's a logical extension of the sentence that came before, they don't spend 30 minutes staring at the same figure making sure that every part of that figure matches the description in the text. And that's why there's a teacher. To give a detailed explanation not just to the information given, but the logics behind it and how best to remember it and understand it.

Plus, since I teach chemistry as a specialty, I give quite a huge chunk of it from a certain point of view that I personally developed in my many years of studying chemistry. It combines information from all kinds of textbooks for both school and university, taking the angle that both explains everything a school student needs to pass the exam but not delving way too deep into hardcore chemistry. There's literally no textbook, expecially in the language native to my students, that gives them the same amount of information that I give during my lessons, in the same order.

To top it all, this is my part-time job, which means that I also have a full-time job that I must do, a condition that the school totally agreed to when I applied. And now, per the departments order, I must spend hours upon hours finding digital material for each and every lesson throughout the school year, which students aren't even allowed to read outside our lessons, because that would classify as spending to much time by the screen. Yeah, students aren't supposed to read stuff off their screens the moment our 25-minute long lessons elapse.

I'm not sure whether I want advice or just to complain about my life, but this is a disaste. All teachers at our school are in a state of shock, looking very depressed and distraught.",1602772145,Shevvv,0

I relate to that top comment. I’m Polish. Pierogi is already plural, and pierogis just irks me. It will always be less correct to me than the proper pierogi.

But I also recognize the other side of the argument: cannoli, ravioli, pierogi, etc. are already very popular in English-speaking countries. The words are commonly used, and English grammar assigns an s to a plural word. It’d certainly be strange to say “pizze” instead of “pizzas.”

linguistics,"DAE notice an Uncanny Valley effect when an L2 speaker masters the phonology near perfectly, while struggling with other aspects of the language?","I'm a bit of a human parrot. For some reason, learning to mimic the subtle quirks of the way another person talks has never been hard for me. This has made me an eager foreign language student; I've never been daunted by learning to produce sounds my native English doesn't use, or learning to distinguish two sounds that English doesn't distinguish. This has definitely given me a leg up and a boost of confidence whenever starting a new second language, since phonological differences are one of the first and most formidable barriers to beginners. From my understanding, similarity of phonology to one's native language is a major factor in how easy or hard a language seems to students.

But this has been a mixed blessing. After striking them as a quick learner in the beginning, I've had language teachers feel let down by me, when I reach the advanced levels and struggle to express myself as much as my classmates do. I've had language teachers conclude I'm not applying myself as hard as I was in the beginning, or have lost interest in the language (or worse, the culture that speaks it).

There have been times when I've felt especially sharp and energetic when meeting with a native speaker of a language I'm learning, and been unusually quick at coming up with the right vocabulary and grammatical structures to have a conversation with them. Combined with a pretty good grasp of the language's phonology, I've unintentionally convinced the native speaker I'm much more fluent than I am. Soon enough though, things get awkward when they realize I'm not grasping what they're saying nearly as much as they thought I did. I've even had some appear to feel misled, and recoil, and thereafter resist speaking their native language with me.

My theory is that there's something about a speaker's phonology and prosody which signal to a listener's brain, *This person in front of me is a fellow native-level speaker of my language; I can speak spontaneously in my native language and according to the norms of my culture, and be understood with no trouble.* Having this perception, and then having it broken, feels jarring. How much of what you've already said didn't register with them at all? How much of what they've said can you trust is what they *really* wanted to say? You thought you knew exactly what they were thinking and intending. Now you're not so sure.

From my experience, I would certainly recommend any beginning student of a language practice the new phonology enough to prevent misunderstanding. But I would caution against being a perfectionist about pronunciation until your vocabulary, grammar, and most of all *usage* are at an intermediate to advanced level. You want native speakers to want to speak the language with you, after all. And fronting with near-perfect phonology can send the wrong message.

Has anyone else noticed such a thing? Has there been any research done on what factors are likely to make a native speaker feel [un]comfortable using their native language with a non-native speaker?",1602646252,hononononoh,158

linguistics,How we mentally define words,"I am not educated in linguistics at all formally, so I'm sorry about that, but I wanted to see if this idea would fall into any existing theories or frameworks and what people would think of it generally. 

I get a couple different word a day emails, and I've begun to realize that when I read a word in isolation before preceding to its definition, I don't conceptualize it through other vocabulary mentally. For example, I remember that ""chomping"" came up at one point, and as I read it, not potential synonyms but a vivid but foggy mental image came to mind. I certainly heard and saw ""chomping,"" kind of a diorama of plato's world of forms. 

My assertion/observation that I want to understand better is this: we don't remember words by comparable definitions, but through tangible experiences. The brain, at least from what I've felt, doesn't seem to access its bank of verbal knowledge in this context to explain the word to the waking mind. I think this changes with more esoteric terms, something like hegemony doesn't have a clear physical parallel, but I suspect that there's an expansive grey area in between the two.

Our weekly Q&amp;A thread is the perfect place to post them! A new Q&amp;A thread goes up every Monday, but we have people who read them regularly throughout the week.

**What counts as a “quick question”?**

Any question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate discussion all of the time, here are some examples: 

*Quick questions:*

* Asking for an explanation of a technical term
* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature
* Asking how we would transcribe something
* Asking how a feature works in a particular language

*Not-so-quick questions:*

* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

Also, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first.

**What if I didn't get an answer to my question last week?**

Your question probably wasn’t answered because no one who knew the answer saw it.

""Pig"" is either *lamboresy* (""defeated wild boar"", where *lambo* (""wild boar"") is hypothesised to come from Malay *lembu* (""cattle"")) or *kisoa* (from French *cochon*). 

All native dogs in Madagascar are descended from dogs from mainland Africa rather than southeast Asian dogs (which should be the case, as the first Austronesian migrants to Madagascar came from the Malay Archipelago). The reason for this has been supposed to be that while the Austronesian migrants would have brought dogs (and chickens and pigs) with them, they did not survive the journey to Madagascar.

Based on my cursory look at the Austronesian Comparative Dictionary, I have supposed that the Malagasy for dog could have been \**aso* (using Malagasy orthography where &lt;o&gt; = \[u\]) and the word for pig could have been \**vavo*.

&amp;#x200B;

The paper makes an interesting claim: 

&gt;Much of the best contemporary work in the philosophy of language and content makes appeal to the theories developed in generative syntax. In particular, there is a presumption that—at some level and in some way—the structures provided by syntactic theory mesh with or support our conception of content/linguistic meaning as grounded in our first-person understanding of our communicative speech acts. This paper will suggest that there is no such tight fit. Its claim will be that, if recent generative theories are on the right lines, *syntactic structure provides both too much and too little to serve as the structural partner for content*, at least as that notion is generally understood in philosophy. The paper will substantiate these claims by an assessment of the recent work of King, Stanley, and others....  
&gt;  
&gt;We have seen that syntactic structure, as understood in recent generative theory, is out of step with the kinds of demands philosophers make of it. It contains both too much and too little. As hopefully made clear, this dissonance is by no means problematic for the linguistic theories, for they do not presume to capture the same intuitions or notions that animate philosophical research. They might be off course in other ways, but it would be obtuse to condemn them on grounds quite outside their empirical and theoretical range. Equally, my plea is not for a veil of silence to fall between linguists and philosophers—quite the opposite. The work of King, Stanley, and others exemplifies the fecundity of a philosophy of language oriented to our best science of language. If my considerations show anything, it is perhaps only that a closer integration is required if linguistic results are to play a genuine role in shaping philosophical accounts of language, as they must, if such philosophy is to be a serious area of inquiry 

&amp;#x200B;

linguistics,Is this article a case of bad linguistics?,"Article: https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20201006-are-some-languages-more-sexist-than-others

I'm not a linguist, but I've been following this sub for a while and a couple of things in this article seem to go against what I've read on here. In particular, two assumptions the author makes stand out, namely:
1) that different languages affect the way we think and see the world,
2) that the masculine gender is ascribed as a default by language (author seems to oscillate between all languages and some languages on this point, but seems to assume that at least some languages do).

From similar posts here, I thought I'd gathered that mainstream linguists these days reject the idea that language affects the way we think, and also that the feminine gender (at least in IE languages) is an offshoot of a common gender, the animate half of an original animate/inanimate gender distinction. At least from a historical perspective, the reason that masculine gender is default is because of this evolution, not because of some normative rule of language.

Am I wrong or misunderstanding something here? I'd be grateful for anyone who takes the time to answer, or even read the article and give me their thoughts.

The reason I'm asking is because I've always heard that Dari and Iranian Persian are more or less the same language with minor differences, for example some systematic sound changes and locally influenced vocabulary, but I've also heard that Tajik and Persian are also more or less the same language with minor differences. If that's the case and Dari and Tajik are both just variants of Persian, I'm curious what distinguishes Tajik as it's spoken in Afghanistan from Dari as it's spoken in Afghanistan. Are they quite different or are they quite close to each other? Was it physical separation via mountains or something similar that led to divergence? Are they closer to each other in pronunciation or vocabulary than either of them are to Iranian Persian?

In words like ""better"", ""bat"", it's in the syllable coda. That could be one rule. But then ""mental"", which according to thefreedictionary is syllabified as |men·tal|, has a glottal stop. Is it because people colloquially understand the word as |ment·al|? Then also I remember Danny Dyer say ""fourTEEN"" with a glottal stop, as in ""she was fourteen"", which completely shattered any rules i might have come up with. Or is it just because it's ok to pronounce ""FOURteen"" with a glottal stop so he ignored the change of stress and went on to pronounce ""fourTEEN"" with one too?

This was all wildly interesting and theoretically beautiful to me, to understand movements, subcat frames and various other transformations. 

My problem is now that I’m working on my MA, looking into statistical methods in the study of syntax, where generative grammar once seemed beautiful, it seems mildly useless now.

But I've never been able to understand why words like ""for"", or ""so"" count as coordinators rather than subordinators.

In particular, in English we teach that any of the ""FANBOYS"" (For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So) form coordinate clauses. While words like before, because, while, after etc. form subordinate clauses.

I was angry *because I was confused.* (Subordinate clause)

I was confused, *so I was angry.* (Coordinate clause)

I was angry, *for I was confused.* (Coordinate clause)

These to me seem to express the same logical structure: the confusion is the cause of the anger. Why do words that express a causal dependency still count as coordinate? Basically, ""and"", ""nor"", but"", ""or"" and ""yet"" seem fine as coordinate conjunctions, but ""for"", and ""so"" feel like they should be subordinating conjunctions.

linguistics,"Is ""Durr"" a word?","/r/showerthoughts doesn't allow questions.

""Durr"", ""derr"" or ""duh"" was a very popular utterance in high school, in Australia in the late 90s. It appears to be somewhat universal. Community had [a subplot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YClAMYTEuZ0) about it, so it's clearly still around and in America.

I don't think I've ever read a book that included a fictional character saying it though. It's almost never written. It also seems like you can barely even use it in a sentence.

If you use ""durr"" in a sentence, it's probably going to have quotes around it:

&gt;What did he do?

&gt;He went ""durr.""

It appears to convey meaning, and is somewhat versatile. You could be saying ""This is how stupid I think you're being"", or you could be just announcing that you're refusing to engage with the present matter or people with your intellect. It can be defiant, especially when used on authority. I think it's generally intended to make the target give up all hope of having a meaningful conversation. To deny them their voice.

Is it a word? It's *verbal*. Is it an expression?

Words generally need grammar. ""Durr"" doesn't have grammar. It doesn't even need to be a response to something. It can be used to pre-emptively avoid intellectual engagement.

What the hell is ""durr""? Does anyone know where it came from, how old it is, how culture-dependent it is? Did we have something else before ""durr"", or have we always had it?

linguistics,"Cross-Linguistic Relationships Between Adjectives, Adverbs and Nouns (and possibly Verbs)","I was thinking recently about how adjectives are inflected in Tamil, my mother tongue. Almost all I could think of have a noun root; *-ana* is added to make it a descriptor, *-a(ga)* is added when it is being described in a state of being, and to make it an adverb. E.g, *vegam* = speed, *vegam-ana vandi* = fast vehicle, *vandi vegam-a(ga) irukkinradu* = the vehicle is fast, and *nan vandi-ai vegam-a(ga) otigiren* = I drive the car fast(ly). To make it substantive, you would ad a *-var* (animate) or *-du* (inanimate) to the descriptive form; *vegam-ana-var =* the fast one (animate), *vegam-ana-du* = the fast one (inanimate). There are some adjectives that have a state-of-being/becoming verb derived from the same root, but this is not productive. Having studied Japanese, I am familiar with (i-) adjectives really being state-of-being verbs. This got me thinking about the adjectives and their inflection (or lack of) cross-linguistically. In English, it looks something like: &lt;adj&gt;, &lt;adj + \[ly\] = adv&gt;, &lt; adj + \[variable nominalizing suffix\] = noun&gt;, and like Tamil, there are certain verb derivations which are now unproductive. What are the linguistic reasons for the different development of adjectives.

From what I gather, adjectives generally derive from nouns or verbs, the choice of which explains their behavior in sentences. In Tamil, it looks like they are derived from nouns, in Japanese, the na-class from nouns, and i-class from verbs. In English, I am a bit more confused. What about other languages? Is there a trend in IE, or does it vary based on branch? Are there any languages that inflect adjectives as their own thing (i.e. not declension or conjugation) based on function/agreement/tense/etc. In more analytical languages, how do they treat adjectives. Do adjectives even exist, as we think of them, in all languages? If not, what method do they use to describe stuff? i'm sure the more synthetic languages have a boat load of stuff they can do with adjectives.

TL;DR I just want to know everything about adjectives",1601697178,yutani333,2

linguistics,Question about the Use of 'guy' and 'guys' to Refer to Something,"I have a question about a particular construction I have been hearing more often in the last few years. It is prevalent in both men and women.

it is the use of 'guy' and 'guys' to refer to something. 

For example, 

a) I \[24m\] found myself saying, ""can you grab those guys?"" when asking someone to pick up some boxes.

b) Overheard a co-worker \[22m\] say, ""pass me that guy"" referring to some items in the back of the car. 

c) Two female co-workers \[\~20\] talking about books they are reading while looking at each other's e-book collections:

Female co-worker 1: ""what are these guys about?""

Female co-worker 2: ""... this guy is similar … and these guys are ...""

d) on the bus, someone didn't know how to open the door to exit, and another passenger \[m\] pointed to a specific location on the door saying, ""hand under this guy"", referencing the sensor above the door.

All of these are recent. The book example is from yesterday. 

I find it interesting that

1) 'guy/s' is always used with a demonstrative determiner (this, that, these, those), at least of what I have heard.

2) it seems to be to be some kind of an empty word, akin to 'it', in phases like ""it is raining"". 

in all of these examples, the sentences work just fine, at least for me, without the inclusion of 'guy/s':

a) “can you grab those”  (Cf. “can you grab those guys”)

b) “pass me that”   (Cf. “pass me those guys”)

c) “what are these about”  (Cf. “what are these guys about”)

d) “hand under this” (Cf. “hand under this guy”)

Regarding demographic stats, I have only two things to add: 1) it is mostly young adults who I have heard say these things, &amp; 2) it is primarily men I have heard use it.

linguistics,"Hello linguists, I was wondering if you could entertain an experiment I have been thinking about for a long time","I am not a linguist, in fact I'm a design student currently. But I've always been interested in the science of language, so I decided to conduct an experiment.

[Hornet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71gVMmYvuZc) (0:26) is a character from the videogame hollow knight. This game is incredibly unique due to its nonsense phrases featured in each of the main characters voice lines. Despite having no meaning, they are incredibly emotive and add incredible depth to each of the characters. 

Hornet specifically caught my attention because her voice is so beautiful, and the nonsense phrases she spoke stuck with me for some reason. Personally, I heard a very specific mix of languages in her voice, but I won't tell you what they are because I don't want to skew the results of my experiment. 

My experiment is this: Listen to Hornet's voice lines (linked at top of page) and transcribe them in the comments how you think they are spelled. There's a few grunts and gasps which you can ignore. 

We can compare the responses and see the wide variety of interpretations. The different spellings and separation of syllables into words may teach us a lot about how we interpret speech, and can show how we align what we hear with languages that we already know.

linguistics,A Question Regarding CommonApp / Essays,"Hello!

I have been interested in linguistics for a long time. As a young child, the most accessible and natural way this interest in language came out was in creating little codes, playing language games, and being fascinated by other languages I heard. Eventually, this grew into a more refined hobby: conlanging. Yes, yes. The thing that is looked down upon in some linguistics circles for whatever reason (really—there are a LOT of good arguments in favor of conlanging, especially with more serious and applied versions of it, but I concur). For those who may not be aware, it is, very briefly, the creation of languages (**con**structed **lang**uage). 

Conlanging naturally leads to a study of more formal linguistics— scouring research papers and interestinf case studies of specific phenomena or cross-linguistic patterns, delving deep into currently interesting topics to try and understand it through and through, etc. At this point, reading through papers on LingBuzz, reference grammars and compiled journals in drive folders, studying natural languages, and of course, expending true intellectual effort into conlanging is a major pass time of mine. 

At this point, as has been for a little while, I am really only interested in pursuing linguistics in university, though likely pairing it with compsci, cognitive research fields, etc. to open up more career opportunities (and because they're adjacent topics I can find interesting, just not nearly as much).  

Now, to the present. I am, or will be, working on an admissions essay based on the prompts supplied by Common App. The main prompts I'm looking at are the following:

1.) Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, please share your story.

2.) Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging it makes you lose track of all time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?

3.) Share an essay on any topic of your choice. It can be one you've already written, one that responds to a different prompt, of one of your own design. 

That last one surprised me a bit Got me thinking. My question, which by now you may have an idea of, is this: would it be ""unacceptable,"" unprofessional, or less likely to be noticed if I wrote something about conlanging? Specifically, I was thinking of potentially writing a research essay diving into a specific topic with examples and explanations in a conlang of mine. What it would be I'm not quite sure, and it may be more than what they're looking for if it were to have autosegmental diagrams or syntax trees, but it definitely seems like something that could pique interest and its pretty much the first thing that would ever come to mind. I don't have the resources to properly research specific natural languages at this point, maybe besides something mundane in English, but this could definitely be possible. 

Thank you! Any additional comments, expectation, questions, etc. welcome because I wasn't able to ask every detail I may have for specific things.",1601505006,chiflido-del-sapo,5

linguistics,The Curiousity That is Graislandic,"Just earlier I was looking at Instagram and I came across a strange language called ""Graislandic"". I seen it under a post by @languages.5 (I've linked the exact post [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFrbhkMC5GC/?igshid=fbi70c85kxrn)) by a user with the conspicuously strange name of @sdcvbmyjlkratpdfzqwertklpfddhg, which is what caught my attention . The user claims that *queioùe* (with the unusual IPA transcription of [qioweː]) is the word for 'key' in a language they called ""Graislandic"". My interest was further piqued when I saw that someone else was equally confused by it, and claimed that they'd found nothing but an Instagram account for the language.

I did my own digging, and so far there has been suspiciously little to be found online. Searching ""Graislandic"" brings up a few different sites of (what I presume is) an archived video by Vivien Reis (link [here](https://youtu.be/gV3KMSOXQyg)), under which is a comment by a user named Stelio Const. I've got a [screenshot](http://imgur.com/a/yRVTboF), but you can find the comment if you sort by new and scroll down to comments from a year ago.

Most notably the first line:

&gt;I made a language that called Graislandic language family [sic]

And the fact that this is under a video about making one's own language leads me to suspect that Graislandic may be a conlang.

Secondly, I found the Instagram account: [@kingdom_of_graisland](https://instagram.com/kingdom_of_graisland?igshid=jd3sntlpp8ct). Here, the term ""Graslakian"" is seen also, and the account talks about Graisland/Graslakia being the entire island of Sant'Erasmo, in Venice, Italy ([this video](https://www.instagram.com/p/BmA1dDYnAGD/?igshid=nymd3qluftzj) pointing it out explicitly). In [this post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BU1cna3hqZd/?igshid=1h15dymqge30r), the account states:

&gt;Graslakia or(Graisland)(""Grey Island"") will [be?] a new country in Europe

And in [this one](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bgrdx3SBItF/?igshid=kuun7d2oxj0w), they claim Graisland 

&gt;is Venice actually And [sic] we want independence

Which lead me to think that maybe Graisland was an small independence movement that was unknown, but the evidence of the YouTube video, and the fact that searches for ""graisland venice"", ""graisland sant'erasmo"", and ""graisland independence movement"" either bring up the stuff I've already discovered, or instances of ""Graceland"" and ""grassland"" being misspelt, makes me highly sceptical of this.

Also, Sant'Erasmo's [Wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sant%27Erasmo) says nothing of this supposed linguistic community, nor of any ""kingdom of Graisland"". Searches for what I think is the Graislandic word for Graisland, *Graćlakía/Graćlakĩa/Graislånd* turn up nothing either.

So what's the deal here? Any Italians or even Venetians want to weigh in on this? Have you ever heard of ""Graislandic"", or of there being a significant independence movement on Sant'Erasmo? Are @sdcvbmyjlkratpdfzqwertklpfddhg, @kingdom_of_graisland, and Stelio Const the same person? I still can't even figure out if they're trying to present Graislandic as a real language or not. It's not a big deal or anything, not doing any harm like that kid on the Scots Wikipedia did, but I'm still curious.",1601477784,dubovinius,8

I am also not recalling anything like a school roll call. I have no idea when or where I learnt the first and last names of many girls at school.

To him he observed that some languages do not have words that are abstract and when people introduce some ideas they need to word it in a material context. He used the example of a contract that in one language was introduced as ""binding one's feet"" since the language didn't originally have a word for ""contract"" so they had to try and explain it physically but that lacked a more abstract component. 

Also if there is no dictionary and no writing, then every word in the language needs to be known by each speaker. The people said that they were surprised that people of complex languages don't know every word in their language.

Is this true? Is complex thought, abstract thought, philosophy, and so on, only possible in a language/culture that has a dictionary to include more words than any one person can memorize? I read that some of the oldest dictionaries come from Akkadians-Sumerians and that our alphabet came from the Phoenicians. Is it therefore correct to assume that before such practices spread, that everyone else who lacked writing was incapable of abstract thought? Certainly people have religious ideas but more abstract ones like a contract or questions about ""what is truth"" or even math beyond simple addition seem impossible without writing and a dictionary.",1601366881,pimpdaddy_69,16

I was listening to French music to learn some French, and I noticed that it was quite common to use phrases that sounded similar, but with different meanings. Sort of like rhyme or alliteration, but like whole phrases where just a single sound is changed to completely change the meaning.

Is there a word for this, and is it common in other languages? It would seem like this would require the language to have a large number of homonyms to be able to do this. This is at least not common or easily doable in Norwegian as far as I know. Artists and writers usually just use rhymes, as we have many words ending similarly at least. 

Some examples I noticed:

* Tu étais *formidable*, j'étais *fort minable* (Stromae - Formidable).
* *Aime en silence*, ce que tu penses, *emancipense* (Yelle - Emancipence).

linguistics,"Why do linguistic relationships between Indo-European language families (Greek &amp; Armenian, Italic &amp; Celtic, Balto-Slavic &amp; Indo-Iranian, Albanian &amp; Germanic) not reflect geography?","It is pretty much consensus that of the branches of the Indo-European linguistic tree:

1. Greek and Armenian languages share common roots,
2. Italic and Celtic are the closest to one another,
3. Albanian, while an isolate, is closest to the Germanic languages,
4. The Baltic and Slavic languages are closer to Indo-Iranian languages than the other European branches of the tree are.

Based on geography, the only one of these that makes sense is Italic and Celtic being related. Not if you look at the modern distribution of the Celtic languages which is restricted to the western fringes of Britain and Ireland, but the ancient distribution across northern Italy, France, and Central Europe, combined with the knowledge that the Celtic languages originated in Central Europe. When the Romans conquered northern Italy, for instance, its native population was Celtic-speaking Gauls, and the Gaulish language would have been more recognizably related to Latin than would be Irish Gaelic or Welsh.

But the others do not make sense.

There may have been Greek-speaking populations in Anatolia, including the Black Sea region known as Pontus, right next to Armenia, but the Greek language originated in the Balkan Peninsula, not in Anatolia, and was not particularly related to the Luwian languages (Carian, Trojan, Lydian) which were spoken in a geographic location closer to Greece, while Armenia is not particularly close to Greece geographically.

Similarly, Albania is nowhere near the Germanic countries, so even though the relation is only distant, it seems strange and implausible how this happened.

Finally, the Baltic and Slavic languages being the closest European branch to Indo-Iranian does not make a lot of sense.

Since presumably these alternate pronunciations both come from African influence from both islands being slave trade hubs early in their colonization why is the change different?

linguistics,Why do we pronounce words we learned from foreigners differently?,"  I cannot find the answer to this anywhere, and I don’t even know what to call it, but I’m sure this is a known linguistic phenomenon, and I would so appreciate someone explaining this. On the surface it sounds pretty obvious, because we see it all the time, but my own personal experience with this phenomenon makes me think it’s much more complex than we give it credit.

I’m so curious as to why certain native speakers of a language will pronounce particular words in another accent. For example, it’s common for second generation Spanish-speaking Americans to have a “standard” American accent when they’re speaking English, but when they say a Spanish word it’s *accented* (“Please hand me that *mojito*” or “My name is *Juan Quintanilla*”). Please refer to this example:

[https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anchor-explains-her-spanish-pronunciations-to-viewers\_n\_55e72121e4b0c818f61a0b39](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anchor-explains-her-spanish-pronunciations-to-viewers_n_55e72121e4b0c818f61a0b39)

I only became curious about this when I took a literature class with a professor from Dominica, in the Caribbean. One of our heavily discussed books was a “coming of age” novel, which in literary circles is apparently known as a “bildungsroman.” I was entirely unfamiliar with this word, but I understood the concept perfectly. As I had never encountered the word before, I pronounced it just as she did. I had no frame of reference for what this word would have sounded like if it were spoken by any other accent, including my own (American).   After hearing her use this word often, and using it myself in one-on-one discussions with the professor, it dawned on me that I was using her Dominican accent to pronounce the word “bildungsroman.” But I was doing it entirely unconsciously, with zero attempt to imitate her accent. To this day, I’ve never heard “bildungsroman” spoken with an American accent, and I suspect that if I had just encountered this word in a book, and attempted to pronounce it in a way that made sense to me, it would not sound the same as the way I pronounce it now.

Another quick example: a friend from Virginia went to college in Philadelphia, where she was exposed to “water ice” for the first time, and presumably heard the words “water ice” spoken by native Philadelphians. This woman still pronounces “water” like she always has, but when she says “water ice” it comes out as “warterice” (with a Philadelphia accent). This could be an affect, but I think it’s more than that, and it seems similar to my bildungsroman example above.

linguistics,"Is it normal for a bilingual to distinguish two phonemes in one language perfectly, but not be able to distinguish the same two sounds in the other language at all?","I'm sorry if the title is confusing, I'll give you an example right here. So, I'm a bilingual that speaks Italian and Russian natively (Italian being slightly more dominant, something like 60-40). 

I recently got really interested in linguistics (we have a basic course at university since I'm studying to become an interpreter), and our professor explained to us students that [s] and [z] are allophones of the same phoneme /s/ in Italian, and the pronunciation depends on the environment (e.g. it's pronounced as [z] before voiced consonants). One cool gimmick about this phoneme is that its intervocalic realization (e.g. &lt;casa&gt; ""house"") depends on whether the speaker is from Southern Italy ([s] realization) or Northern Italy ([z] realization), so technically you can guess where an Italian comes from by paying attention to the intervocalic /s/. So I've been listening to a lot of people lately, just to catch which realization a person makes, but the crazy thing is, I have to concentrate **really hard** in order to be able to tell for sure if the ""subject"" is using one or the other pronunciation. But even crazier, Russian HAS /s/ AND /z/ AS DIFFERENT PHONEMES, and while speaking or listening to Russian I've NEVER had trouble differentiating between the two in my entire life, so I don't get why I'm not able to tell the difference as flawlessly while engaging in a conversation in Italian :c.

The same thing happens the other way around, e.g. Italian distinguishes between an open-mid /ɛ/ vowel and a close-mid /e/ one. Russian has only one /e/ phoneme, but I've recently found out, while reading a Russian linguistics book (and it freaking blew my mind), that the &lt;э&gt; in &lt;это&gt; ""this"" /'eto/ and &lt;эти&gt; ""these"" /'etʲi/ are pronounced differently, with /e/ being pronounced as close-mid before palatalized consonants, and as open-mid before the non-palatalized ones. I had to repeat these two words for a dozen times before hearing any difference between the two, despite the fact that their realizations sounded **exactly** like the Italian /ɛ/ and /e/, and I still can't hear any difference when paying attention to the /e/ in normal speech (unless concentrating very hard of course). 

Last thing, the only non-native language I'm fluent in is English. I've noticed that I can perfectly tell whether someone is pronouncing [s] or [z] and [ɛ] or [e] while speaking it, I don't have to concentrate or anything. It's like I have this preset of both Russian and Italian sounds in my mind when speaking foreign languages, but while speaking one of my native languages, I kinda put aside the phonological preset of the other native language, if that makes sense.

I was just curious if this is a known phenomenon in linguistics, and if so, I would like to learn more about it.",1600906253,Lapov,102

linguistics,Looking for research/ a cross-cultural list of the ages at which it is most common for children to learn different words and concepts.,"I'm sure this is extensively studied but I don't know what to call it well enough to find via Google.

I'm looking for the common order/ages at which children across cultures tend to learn or seem to understand different words and concepts. For example, what are the most common first words? What are the most common first 20? Do they tend learn the word mama I before you or vice versa? At what age do they seem to understand that their name refers to them? Or that mom refers to mom? 

I'd like to find the raw data for this, but also am interested in any meta-analysis of trends and categories(are nouns first? Are words associated with asking for needs to be met? When do time concepts begin to arrive and in what order?). Also, interested in what the order these things happen in might mean for the philosophy of language and especially the development of ethics.

Aaaand finally, maybe a longshot, but anything tying any of this into Wittgenstein, Merleau-Ponty, or Levinas would be spectacular.

Sorry for the long list. I really just need to be told what the words for these concepts are in the field of linguistics so I can find the research about it. Book or source recommendations would be helpful as well.",1600719132,reasonablefideist,0
linguistics,What would have British Romance sounded and looked like had it survived to the modern day?,"British Romance was a variety of Vulgar Latin spoken in Roman Britain. On the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons, the language of the land switched from Brittonic Celtic and British Romance to Anglo-Saxon (old English).

Of course, today English has a lot of Romance vocabulary to the point that some people say it is a hybrid Germanic-Romance tongue. However, that is not due to British Romance but rather due to Middle French and Latin influencing English during the days of the Norman occupation of England.

So had British Romance survived in Britain, how would it be? If it survived the Anglo Saxons, would it be a Romance language with a heavy infusion of Insular Celtic and Germanic? Or had the Anglo-Saxon invasion failed on a linguistic level just as the Germanic invasions did in France, would British Romance possess a Celtic substratum with just minor Germanic influence?",1600716308,chonchcreature,7

linguistics,What Alternative Forms of Transcribing Percussives Are Accurate To Use?,"The only percussives with symbols, as you may know are the bilabial percussive [ʬ], the bidental percussive [ʭ], and the sublingual percussive [¡]. 


On the extIPA, percussives are the row under Lateral Approximants which is under Nareal Fricatives. When I transcribe percussives other than those in the places of articulation I mentioned, I use a nareal fricative symbol and a lowered articulation diacritic (I can't use lowered art. on a lateral approximant, because that'd be a lateral tap). For example, alveolar percussive = [n̞͋]; palatal percussive = [ɲ͋˕]; uvular percussive = [ɴ̞͋]; etc.


I find this do look a bit messy since ◌͋ doesnt look that great and each symbol will need at least two diacritics (◌͋ + ◌̞). I recently thought of using a plosive symbol + ◌̝ but idk if that's accurate, as in idk if a raised plosive is a percussive. Do you have any suggestions that don't look as messy as ◌̞͋ but still accurate?",1600699621,Mr_Dr_IPA,0

linguistics,"This week's Q&amp;A thread -- please read before asking or answering a question! - September 21, 2020","Do you have a quick question about language or linguistics that doesn’t merit its own thread? Our weekly Q&amp;A thread is the perfect place to post them! A new Q&amp;A thread goes up every Monday, but we have people who read them regularly throughout the week.

**What counts as a “quick question”?**

Any question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate discussion all of the time, here are some examples: 

*Quick questions:*

* Asking for an explanation of a technical term
* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature
* Asking how we would transcribe something
* Asking how a feature works in a particular language

*Not-so-quick questions:*

* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

Also, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first.

linguistics,Any one willing to share their journey with learning a new language?,"Hi. I have to write a paper for one of my classes on the struggles of learning a new language. Although I was suppose to learn Spanish in high school, I never really got to do it due to the personal issues I was facing during the time. I really have no experience in learning a new language.

 My teacher told me I could interview someone or ask these questions to someone else who learned a second language and then apply the material we are learning in class to it. 
So, if anyone is willing to share there experience and answer some of these questions that would be greatly appreciated. You don't have to answer all the questions, just anything you're willing to share. Thanks in advance!
Btw, I will be applying the information we learn in class to these topics as it is a linguistics class. It won't be my just writing about your experiences. 

1. What was it like for you to learn a second language? What helped? What didn’t help? Why?

2. Do you feel that your age was a factor in your ability to learn a second language? Do you think your experience would have been different if you had started learning at a different age? If you feel that age was a factor in your learning, how was it a factor?

3. In what environment did you learn your second language? Was it in a classroom? Was it in a country where the language was spoken? Was it outside of school in the community? What were the characteristics of the learning environment? How do you think the learning environment influenced your ability to learn the language?

4. What individual personality traits played a role in your language learning? Think about traits like risk-taking, extroversion vs introversion (outgoing vs shy), and so on. Were you willing to make mistakes or did you feel the need to be correct all the time? Did you seek out opportunities to use the language or did you rely primarily on classroom time?

5. How did your attitudes impact your ability to learn a second language? Were you motivated to learn the language or were you required to study the language? Did you feel the need to learn the language? Did you like people who spoke the language or did you have any negative stereotypes of those speakers? In what ways did your attitudes impact your language learning?

6. Were there any social or cultural factors that influenced your language learning? In other words, were there any expectations based on gender, socioeconomic background, etc. that impacted your language learning? If so, how did these expectations influence your learning?",1600633601,RosaceousPueblo,4

linguistics,"What would have been the phonology of Andalusian Arabic, had it survived to the present day in Spain and Portugal?","Would it have been a highly conservative form of Arabic? That is, given that dialects isolated geographically or linguistically turn into conservative forms of their ancestor like Romanian and Sardinian are with regards to Latin.

Or would Andalusian Arabic have been highly divergent from all other forms of Arabic given its proximity and contact with Romance languages, and its isolation from other Arabic “dialects” (really, languages). An example is Maltese, essentially a form of Sicilian Arabic which has diverged to the point of being unrecognizable as even being originally an Arabic dialect except, reportedly, some mutual intelligibility with Tunisian Arabic.

Personally, here is what I think Andalusian Arabic would have looked like phonologically: /q/ -&gt; /g/, /dʒ/ -&gt; /ʒ/, /ɮˤ/ is maintained and doesn’t become /dˤ/ or at most it becomes de-pharyngealized /ɮ/, /sˤ/ -&gt; /ts/ or /tsˤ/, dental fricatives are maintained, /ðˤ/ is maintained or turns into /dz/ or /dzˤ/. /tˤ/ is maintained. /p/, /v/, and /tʃ/ are introduced. /dʒ/ gets re-introduced after the original turns into /ʒ/. The velar~uvular fricatives become pre-uvular/post-velar.

linguistics,I think I want to study Linguistics but idk if it would fit my research area! Looking for some guidance &amp; thoughts of studying abroad for a Masters.,"A little background- I earned 2 bachelors in marketing and psychology a year ago (in the US), and have been working in marketing since. I recently decided I would like to become a social psychologist but want to get my masters in something else first (due to minimal research experience in undergrad/wanting to diversify my education). As a social psychology PhD student, I know I will want to study something along the lines of humor, but that’s all I have- and seeing as it’s a few years out, I’m not super focused on finding my topic atm. 

1) For my masters, I would like to study specifically the language in comedy/comedians, either looking at cultural differences in humor or between genders or both! I’m sure there are a few areas that I could probably research this in- cultural anthropology, communications, etc. but I feel like linguistics makes the most sense? Looking for guidance on this to make sure I’m not completely coming out of left field. Does this research make sense from a linguistics standpoint?

2) I would like to study abroad for my masters if possible (seeing as how I’m unsure how much a psych PhD earned abroad will translate for work elsewhere - from what I’ve researched, it looks like the US Psych PhDs translate well to get work in other countries (primarily EU), but not always the other way around). For studying linguistics abroad (I’m looking primarily in England but maybe Sweden or Germany), will being a foreign student possibly minimize my Masters research if I’m studying linguistics in a country that isn’t my native country the US? I’m afraid that my American English may make it difficult to understand patterns/humor for my Masters, or not be respected when I apply for PhD programs in the US.

Now, it was quite a conversational moment, and this kind of playing with language is not unusual, especially in direct statements like this. However, later the same day, I was hearing her talk to someone else about another person (B), and she said:

&amp;#x200B;

Boss: ""Yo no sé si B se va, o si **la van a ir**"" 

&amp;#x200B;

|Yo|no|sé|si|ella|se|va,|o|si|la|van|a|ir|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|I|NEG|know.1S.PRES.IND|whether|she|REFL|leave|or|whether|Acc.F.S|go-3P.PRES.IND|to|leave.INF|

Lit. ""I don't know if she's leaving, or if they're gonna leave/go her"", again meaning ""or if they're gonna fire her.""

&amp;#x200B;

She said this in a much more natural way, without skipping a beat, and without a particularly playful tone. Like I said before, I wouldn't be surprised by playing with how the language works in direct statements, but it is a lot less common in periphrastic constructions (such as the *ir +* verb future used here), and especially not with any degree of naturality. 

&amp;#x200B;

linguistics,Hard vs. soft TH,"I'm curious about a phenomenon I've learnt about only quite recently, which is that it seems quite widespread to call the voiced TH sound a ""hard TH"" and the unvoiced TH sound a ""soft TH."" Mostly I'm just curious about why this is the case, and why it seems to be, as far as I can tell, totally uncontested, because it strikes me as extremely counterintuitive. To my mind, there's an obvious link between unvoiced sounds being ""harder"" than voiced sounds--K is ""harder"" than G, S is harder than Z, CH is harder than J, and so on. It just seems so obvious to me that I""d never even given it a conscious thought until heard someone calling a voiced TH a ""hard TH,"" did a double take, did a Google, and then did another double take when I saw the entire internet agreeing with my interlocutor.

linguistics,Have you ever heard genuine Corsican language and its peculiar accent/pronunciation ? Top widespread beliefs about Corsican language.," Have you ever heard genuine Corsican language and its peculiar accent/pronunciation ? If it's not the case, check this video with North Corsican speakers : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBVg3S1xywo&amp;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBVg3S1xywo&amp;)

**Top widespread beliefs about Corsican language:**

&amp;#x200B;

* ***Corsican is not a language, just a dialect of Italian.***

Italian and Corsican are both derived from old Tuscan, so it’s like 2 brother languages.

&amp;#x200B;

* ***I went to Corsica and I’ve never heard Corsican language, it means that the language is almost dead.***

Wrong Conclusion:

The Corsican language is still alive and spoken, even by **young native Corsicans**. But, especially in the big Corsican cities, even Corsican speakers will speak French most often **because they are mixed with French people who don’t speak a word of Corsican**. Indeed native Corsican are today barely the majority of the population (\~50-55%) in the island. Over the past half-century, the Corsican population has grown by nearly 129.000 people, including 120.541 arriving from outside (mostly continental France). So all the Corsican speaker will use their language at home or with friends who speak Corsican but not spontaneously with strangers. Moreover in touristic area, the most seasonal workers (in bar, restaurant, beach…) came for continental France just for the summer, so tourists could rarely heard Corsican language.

&amp;#x200B;

* ***Corsican language is a mix between French, Italian and Ligurian (Genoese) languages.***

Corsican is not a mix between French and Italian. The only French influence concerns some loan-words for moderns concepts e.g. *ordinatore* for computer, *vittura* for car, *aviò* for airplane…

The island has been under Genoese control for \~5 centuries. But Tuscan remains the official language under Genoese domination until the middle of the 19^(th) century. The Genoese language does not seem to have left a deep mark in the Corsican language (*i.e.* just few words: *brennu, carbusgiu , spichjetti, mandile, tisori, arrimbà, bancalaru, carrega, carrughju, scagnu*).

&amp;#x200B;

* ***A Corsican speaker from the North can’t understand a Corsican speaker for the South because there are differents Corsican dialects with huge differences.***

The dialectal variation is overestimated by some, who want to find an argument against the officialization of the language. There is the same degree of incomprehension between a North and South Corsican speaker than between a British and American speaker (*i.e*. \~100%). There is no regional variation of the syntax and grammar of the Corsican language.

The main differences are:

1. The most highlighted point is the vocabulary difference. It indeed exists but in fact for quite a few words, especially for the vocabulary of fauna and flora. NB: the same goes between UK and US English *e.g.* highway/motorway, eggplant/aubergine, elevator/lift … This does not mean that UK ans US English are two different languages !
2. Some word-end *i.e.* in the south, when the letter “e” at the end of a word is unstressed, it is replaced by an “i” in most of the cases or “a” for the infinitive verb. For example: *pane, mare, induve, accende* in the north become *pani, mani, induva, accenda* in the south.
3. The groups of letters g, ll, gli and rn in the noth become ghj, dd, dd and rr in the south.
4. Some differences in the accent and pronunciation (*cf.* linked video description).

&amp;#x200B;

* ***Corsican is just an oral language:***

Wrong today:

The first texts written in Corsican *by choice* are found at the end of the 18th century. Then at the beginning of the 19th century, the first famous writer in Corsica appeared like Mgr. De La Foata or Salvatore Viale (who wrote the first printed Corsican text in 1817 ""*u sirinatu di Scappinu*""). The older texts were written in Tuscan (elite language), but with a strong Corsican influence in terms of syntax and vocabulary.

However, the spelling system was not standardised until the 1970s. The orthography proposed by P. Marchetti and D. Geronimi is actually the standard used in the Corsican media, literature and education. With this spelling standard, some sounds specifics to Corsican (absents in Italian) can be written *e.g.* the famous consonants “chj” and “ghj” which correspond to the sounds \[ɟ\] and \[c\] of the International Phonetic Alphabet.

&amp;#x200B;

* ***They all use the ""French r"" pronunciation and nasal vowel like in French:***

The situation of the /r/ is particular: 

1. Some Corsicans, even olders, use often the ""French r"" *i.e.* voiced uvular fricative = \[ʁ\]. In the video, ""Ghjuvanna"" uses often that sound. 
2. The there is still Corsican speakers who use the ""italian r"" *i.e.* voiced uvular trill = \[ʀ\]. But, especially in the north, we use also the voiced alveolar tap = \[ɾ\] in alternance with the \[ʀ\] (*e.g.* \[ʀ\] at the begining of a word, and \[ɾ\] between two vowels). In the video, ""Paulu use the ""Italian r"" \[ʀ\] and the \[ɾ\].
3. Many Corsican speakers mix this three sounds of /r/ like ""Petr'Antò"" and ""Maria"" in the video.

 About nasal vowels: they are not a feature of the French influence, it has been proved by linguists like Marie-José Dalbera-Stefanaggi: 

1. **Corsican nasalization does not coincide with the French model, neither standard nor regional.**
2. Even old native Corsican speakers (who learnt Corsican before French) use nasal vowel. 
3. The elderly in the most remote villages tend to nasalize more than the youngs.",1600349788,spectator_nouus,8

I finished my PhD in linguistics a few years ago, and I've been stuck in perpetual adjuncthood since then. It's frustrating, it's tiring, and every year the university I'm at tells me ""we're going to try to open up a tenure line soon, maybe next year!"" But it never happens. Every now and then they'll scrape together some extra funds and pay me a visiting assistant professor salary for a semester or two, but usually I'm getting paid as an adjunct. I make the same amount as an instructor teaching linguistics at a university (pretty much carrying the entire program while the other linguists are serving as interim dean, or interim chair, or they're on sabbatical) as I did as a 20 year old working as a cashier at a video rental store. That was a fine wage for a 20 year old with no responsibilities, but now I'm 35, I have a PhD, and 3 kids, so this isn't going to cut it forever. I've applied for dozens and dozens of academic jobs at other universities, and I've only gotten 4 interviews. Obviously, none of those resulted in a new job. I do have another job interview later this week, so we'll see how that goes, but if it doesn't work out, I'm seriously considering leaving academia. I love academic work. But I also love being able to pay my bills, and having job security.

So, does anyone have any ideas on what a PhD holder in linguistics might do outside of academia?

People I know have suggested that I look into working for an indigenous tribe that has a language program, and while that would be an interesting gig, those types of jobs are few and far between, and I worry that I'd end up dealing with some of the same issues that I'm already dealing with (in terms of job security, for example).

Somewhere along in our convo he said ""since of"" in place of ""because of."" I forget the exact wording of the full sentence, but it was along the lines of ""x happened, so since of x, I will do y.""  
  
I asked him if he had just meant ""[in the] sense of"" and just phrased it weird, but upon further questioning he confirmed to me that definitely meant s-i-n-c-e, used as a synonym to because, and that ""since of"" is natural to his idiolect and he uses it regularly.  
  
I have never heard this construction before, and I find it extremely interesting. For me, I can essentially subsistence 'because"" for ""since"" in every context, except for ""because of"" specifically (Could be forgetting something though.)

I'm working on my corpus right now in which I want to count the number of occurrences of a few specific words. in my corpus I can, among others, divide into male and female ""mini corpora"" of which the male part is substantially bigger (\~1.600.000 word tokens) than the female part (\~250.000). yet, I would like to calculate the normalised frequencies of the words I'm analysing and see in which of the two ""corpora"" they occur more frequently. having calculated the normalised frequencies of the words the numbers could be compared easier to one another than simply using the absolute numbers.

usually when calculating a normalised frequency you divide the number of occurences of the word by the total number of word tokens in your corpus and depending on the size multiply the result by whatever factor makes sense for the given corpus (10.000, 100.000, 1.000.000 etc.) to have numbers comparable to one another. when I choose to multiply by 100.000 tho, which I thought would make more sense in this case, I get really strange numbers which don't really feel right. would it be better to multiply by 1.000.000 in this case? or is this just a case in which I shouldn't be comparing these two sets of data in the first place due to the big differences in size?

Our weekly Q&amp;A thread is the perfect place to post them! A new Q&amp;A thread goes up every Monday, but we have people who read them regularly throughout the week.

**What counts as a “quick question”?**

Any question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate discussion all of the time, here are some examples: 

*Quick questions:*

* Asking for an explanation of a technical term
* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature
* Asking how we would transcribe something
* Asking how a feature works in a particular language

*Not-so-quick questions:*

* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

Also, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first.

In Alaska, recognition of 20 of the indigenous languages seemed to inspire one grocery store chain to offer signage in local languages.

What does giving a language, particularly indigenous languages, “official” status mean in practice, though? From what I’m finding, it seems to fall into the realm of nice, but not enough.

&amp;#x200B;

When indicating possession, I pronounce it as have (""I have a dog""), but as ""hæf"" in sentences like ""I have to (do something)"". This distinction seems pretty consistent in my own speech, but I'm wondering if maybe the reason is because the t in ""to"" is unvoiced so it assimilates the v in have. Maybe this is more widespread than I realize but isn't really talked about very often. Even in sentences with possession that also have an unvoiced consonant, like ""I have tuberculosis"", I pronounce it as v even though a t follows. Furthermore, in ""I have shoes"", the same occurs. I pronounce it as v, so it can't just be because of the voicing. It seems to me like my brain knows when to use each according to the meaning, and it isn't just choosing f or v based on which is easier to pronounce with whatever sound comes next.

linguistics,Cross-linguistic occurrence of historically inclusive “we”?,"I just saw a documentary from the British Museum where the presenter asked a curator “What were we doing in London [while the late Roman Emperors were up to this and that]?” Similarly, when I went on a guided walking tour in Cambridge a few years ago, the guide said proudly “We built this church in 1096”. My family and I found this very amusing. 

Is this “we” that connects yourself centuries back in time common in English, and does it also exist in your native language if you have another one? 

I haven’t noticed this tendency nearly as much in my native Swedish and find it strange - when I listen to history podcasts in Swedish, my impression is that it’s much more common for the presenters to use “man” (approximately generic “you” or formal “one”) or just “they” to refer to what Scandinavians did in the past. I mean, it wasn’t me who went raiding in England or Russia and it wasn’t my 25-year-old English tour guide who built that church.

linguistics,Old east slavic loanwords in Latvian,"I'm confused by the etymology of a lot of words in Latvian (LV) who were according to dictionaries borrowed from Old east slavic (OES) but exhibit consonnantal reflexes which are clearly more archaic than their OES counterparts.

For exemple the word ""cilvēks"" (human) was apparently borrowed from OES čelovekъ, that itself comes from an earlier form *kelovekъ. How do we know that this is a borrowing from OES given that the palatalization of k to č had already long happened in OES  when the word was supposedly borrowed but the LV word shows a palatalization from k to c instead (which is the normal way k is palatalized in LV). Wouldn't it be far mor logical that this word be an earlier borrowing from proto-slavic or simply that they both come from Proto-balto-slavic kelovekъ?

Idem with the word ""nazis"" (knife), the dictionary indicates that this word was borrowed from OES nožь (which comes from an earlier *noziti) but i don't understand how that can be the case since the palatalization from z to ž had already happend even in proto-slavic, and is not reflected in the latvian word which keeps z (the palatalization does happen in the plural ""naži"" but it is due to the LV's declension paradigm)

Let's see if I can make myself more clear with a fake example:

Let's say Portuguese and Spanish, two closely related languages within the Italic branch of the IE family, actually had different roots. Portuguese first began as language X from family A and Spanish first began as language Y from family B, which were unrelated to one another (as much as, say, Latin and German are, or as much as Latin and Mandarin).

But since language X and language Y were in close proximity, interacted all the time, etc., they began borrowing from each other (vocabulary, grammar, etc.). Eventually, the two languages became very similar (let's say as similar as English and German), forming a new branch from two unrelated language branches/families (so like a right-side up 'Y' shape in a language tree instead of the typical upside down 'Y' shape).

linguistics,Test for Phonemic Vowel Length,"Is there any standard procedure or best-practice test to determine if vowel length is a contrastive feature in the language? I am working with the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah to try and standardize their language's orthography, and the phonemic status of long vowels is still somewhat of an open question. 

Here is my current plan: I have found a short list of minimal pairs for long vs. short vowels in a reference grammar book for the related Southern Ute Language. I will attempt to elicit and audio record the words or Paiute cognates of the words on the list by asking our Elders to translate sentences from English to Paiute containing the minimal pair words. I will also ask them for the translations in a random order and not give them an indication of what I am looking for. Once I've collected the raw data, I intend to isolate the presumed minimal pair words and then measure the time of the nucleus in each syllable with our audio editing software (Studio One) in milliseconds. Ideally, there will be a significant difference in vowel length, and that will provide good evidence to support that long vowels need to be indicated in the orthography (probably with just a double vowel \[aa\] or a macron \[ā\]).

Does this sound like a decent experimental design or is there another, more standard way to do it better? Are their standard ratios for determining if a long vowel is contrastively long?

linguistics,Dropping auxiliary verbs beginning yes/no questions in English: Why is it more common than in “wh” questions and statements?,"TLDR; looking for linguistic terms regarding this I can google, suggestions for articles or links where I can read more; opinions, ideas, and whatever you have to share also appreciated! 

QUESTION:
I’ve noticed recently I tend to drop auxiliary verbs at the beginning of yes/no questions in speech:

“You have a minute?” (Drop [do]  ✔️)
“They leaving now?”  (Drop [are]  ✔️)
“That mine?”               (Drop [is]    ✔️)

But it feels strange for me to drop them in the statement form with the exception of [do] (although I’m aware it’s common in some dialects):

“I leaving now.”*    (Drop [am] ✖️)
“That yours.”*        (Drop [is]   ✖️)
“I have a minute.”  (Drop [do]  ✔️)

And for questions with a “wh” word before the auxiliary verb, it seems to be a mixed bag:

“How ya doing?”         (Drop [are] ✔️)
“Where he going?”*    (Drop [is]   ✖️)
“Whatcha want?”        (Drop [do]  ✔️)
“What that?”*              (Drop [is]   ✖️)

Does this have something to do with question transformation, like it’s comfortable to drop the auxiliary verb at the beginning of a question, but not when it comes in the middle of a statement or question?

Does it have to do with pronouns? It seems I drop auxiliaries more before [you] than before [I], [he], [that], etc.

Does it have to do with auxiliary reductions in contractions? Like “what’re” is 2 syllables so the contraction gets dropped, but “what’s” is only 1 syllable and not more effort to say than “what”, so it doesn’t get dropped? (That might explain why I tend to drop [are] before [you] and [they] but not [is] before [he] and [that].)

linguistics,What would this process be called?,"I recently saw a tumblr post alleging the following:

Automatic captioning on YouTube videos almost always transcribes ""due to"" as ""dude to"" in streamer videos, supposedly because it expects gamers to say ""dude"" a lot (I don't know anything about the algorithm, so I'm not going to comment on this hypothesis).  People who watch a lot of YouTube streamers then become convinced that ""dude to"" is in fact the correct spelling/morphology, and thus you get people writing ""dude to"" in gaming wikis.

In fact, if you search google for ""dude to the fact"" in quotes, you do find a lot of hits and they all seem to be instances of this.  (I have yet to see any hits in gaming wikis, however, so this may not in fact be a gamer-specific issue.)  So my question is: if this is indeed correct and people are picking this usage up from YouTube automatic captioning (as opposed to mishearing it naturally or simply making a typo) what would this process be called?  If someone just misheard ""due to"" as ""dude to"" and assumed that's what it was, that would just be a folk etymology, I think.

linguistics,Sign language dictionaries,"For an article I'm writing on dictionaries and language contact, I'm interested to know whether people here can point me to dictionaries of sign languages with certain characteristics. The word *dictionary* is used loosely here, so that if you know of a set of online videos, a small print glossary, etc., that meets any of the criteria I'm looking for, I'm interested in hearing about it.

First, I'm wondering if anyone knows of monolingual sign language resources. This means being able to look up a sign without knowing a different, written language's equivalent, and seeing the definition in that same sign language. Or even something that's mostly monolingual, where the written word might bring you to the definition, but then the entire rest of the entry is a definition of the sign (not merely the translation equivalent, but an actual definition).

Next, I'm wondering whether there are any bilingual sign language dictionaries that do not include a spoken language. In other words, some sort of resource that tells e.g. a BSL speaker the ASL sign.

Lastly, I'm interested to see whether SL dictionaries exist that are aimed principally at Deaf people to help them with the spoken language of their territory (e.g. an English-ASL dictionary that is aimed at the ASL learner of English, not the English learner of ASL). Ideally, this would be made clear in the front matter of the dictionary, but this is not always the case.",1599600032,Choosing_is_a_sin,7

So here I am!

***

**The Test (what I mean by ""patterns"")**

By existence of patterns I mean possibility to do this:

You give to a research participant a marked list with N short quotes of person A (Alice) and a marked list with N short quotes of person B (Bob)

(The participant may ask to change the pair or continue the test)

(The participant doesn't know Alice and Bob at all, Alice and Bob don't have obvious differences in speech and etc.)

Then you give unmarked lists with N quotes each... all quotes on a single list are from the same person (Alice or Bob), but the participant doesn't know from which now

The participant has to correctly mark or separate the unmarked lists

You can do this test with quotes of more persons (not only Alice and Bob)

You also should try to make sure there's no obvious ways to tell the quotes apart

...

Were such tests done, researched?

***

I make two naive assumptions:

- If pattern's exist it's something gigantically big

- Tests weren't done or weren't successful 'cause otherwise it would pop up somewhere, for example in the articles about [Stylometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry) or [Linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics)

linguistics,Articulatory Basis of Prosody,"The [paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gpmdgwqgyhyd) linked to has results from work on a theory of prosody based on how things are said rather than how it sounds, similar to phonetics and the organization of the IPA charts. Here is the abstract:

Current studies of prosody transcribe speech based on auditory and acoustic properties, and thus are dependent on the sound produced by speech. In contrast, the field of phonetics analyzes speech using articulatory properties, and thus is concerned with the mechanisms which produce sound rather than the sound produced. In the following, we introduce a novel theory of prosody which aligns with phonetics, and presents articulatory features of prosody, identified through tactile, auditory, and semantic analysis. This is complimented by a new theory of semantics, based on notions from propositional logic, basic set theory, physics, and a novel, eschatological benevolence function. Each piece of semantic information may be identified by means of a prosodic feature, or some combination of prosodic features, and as such, the prosodic features form the organizational principle of both theories.",1599521146,cogsci_propp,4

linguistics,Research on language/communication in pets like cats and dogs,"Hi everyone. I majored in linguistics and did take a psycholinguistics class where we learned about cases like Koko the gorilla and Washoe, and basically, the gist I remember is that monkeys can *communicate* and sometimes even *approximate* language but don't have the capacity for *actual* language, with true mastery over syntax or grammar.

I was wondering whether there was any work in the research literature on pets, especially cats, and their capacities or lack thereof for language. Some people are absolutely convinced that their pets can understand English, and my time in linguistics makes me inclined to be rather sceptical of that. I haven't watched the videos or looked into it, but some people even point to a pet cat using an augmentative/alternative communication (AAC) device as ""proof"" that they have the capacity for language. 

I am much more inclined to believe that cats are highly intelligent and capable of forming complex systems of association around words and phrases, which allows them to react in pragmatically appropriate ways to human speech in many situations, creating the illusion that they have the capacity for language, when in reality they lack the ability to work with the semantics, morphology, or syntax of linguistic output (in other words, they lack the capacity for language as a hierarchical, rule-governed system). They may realise, for example, that ""come here"" is in indicator that they should go to the person who's calling them (or that it's a way of calling to them), but I doubt they understand that the phrase is made up of two words/morphemes, the logic behind the ordering of the words, or what ""come"" and ""here"" mean on their own and how they fit together syntactically to produce the intended meaning.

linguistics,Hypothetical Development of Case in English,"Of course, I know English did have (and still has vestiges of) quite an extensive case system at one point. But now that it is mostly gone, I am wondering how it might return.

So, if my understanding of grammaticalization is correct, the best chance would be the cliticisation and incorporation of prepositions in English. However, in English, we have quite rigid/mandatory usage of articles, and they are prenominal as well. How would this affect the grammaticalization process? For example, I can see how we can go from ""I live in house"" to ""I live inhouse"" to ""I live inouse"" as a locative case. However, adding in ""the"" would complicate things. ""I live in the house"" -&gt; ""I live inthe house"" -&gt; ""I live ine house""? But that would only develop the case on the article. As OE started developing definite articles from demonstratives, they already had case, so we could have case on both article and noun. However, now that we already have articles, how would case develop?

Additionally, are there any languages that did develop case on top of/after having articles (where both articles and adpositions are on the same side of the noun)? How does that work? Do they inflect just the article, or did they develop noun inflection by agreement/analogy? Or maybe the process is completely different.

Are there any dialects of English that are in the process of grammaticalization? I am not talking about dialects that retain the old case system, but ones that are developing a new one. If so, how are they doing it? Which cases specifically, and what are the processes that led to it?

Lastly, I want to know of what grammatical changes *are* in fact taking place in English, non-hypothetically. Are any dialects developing new constructions? Grammaticalization of any sort? More analytical auxilliaries? Maybe more inflection? Just any non-lexical development in the English language, in any dialect, in any register.

linguistics,First-person relative sentences,"So in English, a relative sentence modifying a first-person noun/pronoun has to be in third-person, right? Like:  
He didn't ask me, who is a certified specialist.

But this also sounds natural to me:  
I, who have nothing, am sad.

But not:  
He didn't ask me, who am a certified specialist.

In Latin, I've only ever seen it in the first person:  
""ista decent umeros gestamina nostros, qui dare certa ferae, dare vulnera possumus hosti, qui modo pestifero tot iugera ventre prementem stravimus innumeris tumidum Pythona sagittis."" (Metamorphoses, Liber I, V. 457-460)

In German, you'd translate the ""qui possumus"" as ""die wir können"", with ""können"" in the first-person plural as in Latin and ""die"" referring to a first-person plural implied noun/pronoun. ""Ich, der ich es habe"", or ""I, who I have it"" is fine for translation, but my German friends told me that you wouldn't say this in regular speech.

Is there any history behind this? Where is the distinction in English (if there actually is one)? Why is something like ""nos, qui possumus"" allowed, ""wir, der wir können"" sometimes allowed, and ""I, who I do this"" not? Why do ""I, who do this"" and ""I, who does this"" both sound fine? And why does ""me, who does this"" sound fine, but not ""me, who do this""?

As an example, the above rendering munāẓaratu l-ḥurūfi l-ʻarabīyah of the [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language): مناظرة الحروف العربية‎ is a transcription, indicating the pronunciation; an example transliteration would be mnaẓrḧ alḥrwf alʻrbyḧ.

linguistics,Opportunities in Linguistics,"This is a topic I’ve been thinking about lately, along the lines of: how can we make more opportunities for people to get involved in linguistics (as an academic field)?

I’m not quite referring to pop linguistics, or getting the layperson interested/learning about linguistics, as valuable as that might be, but rather several related questions:

1. how can we get high school/university students who have never heard of linguistics to consider it as a field of study?
2. how can we provide opportunities for students interested in linguistics who don’t have (many) classes available?
3. how can we provide opportunities (mainly for undergrads, I suppose) to get involved in research in linguistics?

So I’m hoping to start a discussion for:

1. meta-discussion, e.g. about benefits, possible drawbacks, reasons for making linguistics more accessible
2. current opportunities and resources available (so undergrads browsing this sub can learn about them, and others can contribute)
3. ideas for future opportunities and resources  (to possibly inspire grad students/profs(?))

In terms of ways to learn linguistics, I think books or courses are the main way to go. I feel like Youtube/podcasts, while great, are pretty general most of the time and don’t allow students to fully engage with the material, but any in-depth channels are definitely worth presenting here.

I know we have a list in the wiki for books, but I was surprised there are no links. If any are available for free online, I think it’d be great to link them. The only one from the list in “general linguistics” that I know of that is free is [Hayes](https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/20/index.htm). Of course there are ways to acquire books in sketchy manners, but I think it’s also good to promote freely available resources. I’m not sure if I missed it, but I also don’t think it’s clear if there’s a way to contribute and add resources.

I do have quite a few links bookmarked so I won't list them all here, but to give some examples:

* a textbook: [http://eecoppock.info/bootcamp/semantics-boot-camp.pdf](http://eecoppock.info/bootcamp/semantics-boot-camp.pdf)
* course materials: [https://wp.nyu.edu/introsem/](https://wp.nyu.edu/introsem/)
* teaching page of a professor: [https://sites.google.com/view/maria-bittner/teaching](https://sites.google.com/view/maria-bittner/teaching)
* publisher with lots of books: [https://langsci-press.org/catalog](https://langsci-press.org/catalog) (they have volunteers proofread and typeset books, so this is one way anyone can contribute to the cause)
* MIT open course ware: [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/linguistics-and-philosophy/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/linguistics-and-philosophy/)

These should not necessarily all be on the book list, but I would appreciate if people in this community could contribute to some kind of list of freely accessible resources that anyone can browse through. And a further step could be to give some brief review, e.g. “these course materials are easy/hard to use for self-study”, or “this book covers X topic well/poorly”, or “the 2015 version of the course materials is best”, etc.

In terms of research opportunities for undergrads, besides cold-emailing professors, I think [NSF REUs](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/) are the main “structured” way to get involved in the US. [CSLI](https://www-csli.stanford.edu/csli-summer-internship-program-2020) has a great program and some other ones I’ve heard of include [Ohio State](https://u.osu.edu/blnsummer/) and [Swarthmore](https://www.swarthmore.edu/linguistics/national-science-foundation-reu-site). I used to check on LinguistList frequently when looking for new opportunities, but I think the main problem is that there aren’t that many, compared to, say, biology or math.

And for high school students, I believe LSA has a committee working on [adding linguistics to the AP curriculum](https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/ap-linguistics-committee-how-help), but I’m not too familiar so I can’t comment much on that. But I think most intro textbooks would be accessible to high school students too, if they are interested, so questions 1 and 2 are somewhat related.

In terms of ideas for future opportunities:

Online schools: Because of the pandemic, some summer schools which are typically in person have shifted online, such as [WeSSLLI](https://www.brandeis.edu/nasslli2020/) (typically NASSLLI) and [V-NYI](http://nyi.spb.ru/genInfo/) (typically NYI). While there were some drawbacks (timezone issues, larger number of students means more questions which can reduce lecturing time, less natural networking/socializing opportunities, etc.), it also allowed people who wouldn’t normally be able/willing to attend, for example, due to high costs (tuition, travel, accommodations, etc.) Some people at WeSSLLI proposed that some form of WeSSLLI continue in future years, even if an in-person NASSLLI became feasible again, which I think is a great idea definitely worth exploring.

Research: Besides the obvious one of “creating more REUs”, which I’m sure is a lot of work and difficult to get funding for in itself, I think there’s possibilities to create more informal opportunities. I recently heard about [Twoples](https://sites.google.com/view/twoples/about?authuser=0), which to my understanding is a recently-started program for grad students to mentor undergrads on reading/research projects, all online. We’ll have to wait to see how it goes, but I think there’s potential for something similar in linguistics. And it’s also possible for students to work on their own independent projects, but I think it would be hard to know where to even start. Maybe a guide to getting started, or a list of books/topics like [this](https://sites.google.com/site/uwmadisondrp/projects/project-ideas) and [this](https://sites.google.com/site/uwmadisondrp/projects/past-projects) could be helpful.

A final disclaimer: my main interests lie in formal semantics, and because of that, a lot of the resources and ideas I’ve presented are related to that. Since math was my second major, I’m also inspired by the math community (ex. I think there should be things in linguistics similar to what is available in math), though of course different areas of linguistics may be similar to other fields, like psychology. But that’s why I’m posting, so we can have such a discussion as a subreddit and talk about different subfields and bring in different perspectives.

linguistics,"Where does ""preacher speak"" come from? REVISITED and EXPLAINED","There isn't one style of Black Preaching just as there isn't one style of White Preaching. Nor can the styles be defined by theological tradition or denomination.  Like all registers of language, they must be defined by the users and their communities.  One can see the written legacy of Black sermons from the Black Puritan Lemuel Hayes (July 1753 to September 28,1833), Black Methodist like Richard Allen  (February 14, 1760 – March 26, 1831), and Black Abolition preachers like Sojourner Truth and Frederick Douglas. 

Just as there are White differences in the sermon format and length based on denominational practices and levels of education and training between ministers and between denominations, the same can be said of African Americans.

At the turn of the century, James Weldon Johnson translated the orality of the free churches' pastoral sermon forms and practices into written lyrics.  His original composition is entitled *God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse* (1927).  The   Works Progress Administration (*WPA*)  did audio recordings of southern African American sermons during the 30's and 40's that you can hear. (Again, I must caution you that just as there are differences in White Southern, Northern, Eastern and Western practices and class registers involved, the same can be said of African American preachers. These recordings were made in the deep south and targeted the illiterate or barely literate masses, i.e. they are not representative of the full range of Black preaching and Black orality.)  The great migration brought those styles to the North. 

Now for the original question regarding where African American ""preacher speak"" come from in the modern post- 60's period. For context and comparison, you can hear recordings from preachers of the 50's and 60's like Rev. Dr. Benjamin Mays, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Rev. Adam Clayton Powell Jr.,  and the Rev. Clarence LaVaughn Franklin (Aretha Franklin's father), who is a prototype of a Whooping pastor. (I can't find the reference, but it is reported that he had a slight case of asthma so his hacking was not a purposeful rhetorical invention, but was done to clear his lungs).

The whooping style of Rev. Clarence LaVaughn Franklin was occasioned by his asthma and you can hear him clearing his lungs--hacking. However, when listening to other preachers with a similar sing-song style, you will discover that they did not have the hack. One can compare Stanley Green portrayal of Reverend Dawson in the 1960's movie, *Nothing but a Man* (which shows the same style, but without the hacking) and Bishop Louis Henry Ford of St. Paul's Church of God in Christ in Chicago (again without the hacking).  

Many pastors would imitate C. L. Franklin's style of whooping in the 60's through the 80's because his sermonic LP's were best sellers and widely distributed. They imitated his hack without realizing that his hacking was a response to his asthma.  Many Black preachers are ignorant of these historical facts just as White preachers are ignorant of the history of their sermon styles. I hope this helps.",1599284938,Visible_Command_3315,0

daily conversation ( must be from real life ) ----&gt; more complex topic, more advanced vocab, longer sentence...

the idea is simple:

the app will allow user to upload their phonecall record and share with those who want to learn that language.

I never, ever noticed it until my fiancé pointed it out. We live alone, so she would question me about things in the fridge: “They have soup? Who is they? Do you mean WE have soup?” I was perplexed about how to resolve this until I realized that my use of “they have” was closer to “there is”.

Anyway, I just think it’s a linguistic oddity, but I was wondering if it’s a regional thing, or if anyone else does this. We were over for dinner at my parents house the other day and I used this phrase and was teased by my fiancé, and when I explained it to my mom she said that she also used the same expression when talking about things in the fridge or the pantry, and that my dad (who is from a different region of the country) always thought it was weird too. That strongly leads me to believe it’s regional, but it could also be something I simply learned from my mom.",1599196867,stephanonymous,18

linguistics,Development of Agglutinative Features/Languages out of Fusional Features/Languages?,"Does anyone know about the development of agglutinative languages out of fusional languages?  I am thinking in particular about the development of Nepali out of Sanskrit or the Sanskrit-derived fusional language that was a mother to Nepali.    


In Sanskrit and other older fusional Indic languages, you have case endings which vary depending on the stem; in Nepali there is a regular set of post-positions, regardless of the stem word:

\-*le* – ""by"" (instrumental)  
\-*lāī* – ""for"" (dative)  
\-*bāṭa*"" – ""from"" (ablative)  
\-*ko* – ""of"" (genitive)  
\-*mā* – ""in,"" ""at,"" etc. (locative)

Whereas in Sanskrit, and presumably in the Middle-Indic language that directly produced Nepali, the case endings will vary depending on the stem, for example:  


Skt.: *hastāt* ""from the hand"" ( *āt* ablative)                Nep.: *hātbāṭa*  
Skt.: *hastinaḥ* ""from the elephant"" (-*(n)aḥ* ablative)    Nep.: *hastibāṭa*

Skt.: *devyāḥ* ""from the goddess"" (-*āḥ* ablative)        Nep.: *devībāṭa*

&amp;#x200B;

It seems this may be a common occurrence, a fusional language naturally developing into an agglutinative language.  Or is there influence from other agglutinative languages (e.g. Newari or Tibetan) that may explain this?",1599193435,DorjePhurba,0

linguistics,I love defective verbs. Are there any cool defective verbs you know of from any language?,"I think I gained an appreciation for defective verbs when learning French, falloir just makes me happy ok?? I'm am an English native though, so I could say that I should have already had a decent appreciation of them already. Does anyone else know of any defective verbs which they just can't get enough of?

I will start by saying what I like about falloir. It's meaning relates to nessesity, or reponsibility. Often translated as must. It can only be conjugated with il (he/it). My favorite part is that the meaning can be left vague. eg. il faut partir, means most acurately ""It's nessesary to leave"". But could also mean ""I gotta go""  or ""you need to leave"". I won't go too deep into it but it can be made more specific in a high register by saying ""il me faut partir"". I believe people wouldn't say that normally though. More casually you can say ""il faut que je parte"".

In English my favorite defective verb is ""can"" with its utterly adorable infinitive replacement ""to be able to"".

So please leave your favorite defective verbs if you have any and tell me how they work and what they can't do.",1599170094,timmytissue,293

linguistics,Teabagging - the in-game language of Dead by Daylight,"I've been playing Dead by Daylight mobile for a couple of months now and I am fascinated by the in-game language the players have created over time: teabagging 

What is teabagging?  It's an in-game action where your character would crouch to reduce its height and hopefully hide itself from the killer. Players hit the crouch button many times to convey a message to other survivors. Came by my generator while wounded?  I'll teabag you to let you know I will heal you first before we pursue mission objective. The community called it ""teabagging"" because it mimics the act of dropping your teabag many times in a cup of hot water to make your tea.

It's a very contextual language wherein depending on the game elements present, you message will be interpreted based on how familiar is the other player to the game logic. For example, towards the end of the game and I know I'm the only one left (makes the mission objective almost impossible to complete) I will teabag the killer to let me go. My fate as a survivor now rests on the killer's hands. Since killers in the game essentially cannot crouch (except for 2 specific killers), they will try to wave their weapon in the air or swing it on other objects to let me know the message is understood, otherwise I will just be struck down to denote that the killer doesn't agree.

It's amazing how universally it's understood within the game.",1599168109,i-cussmmtimes,3

linguistics,Indo-European Methodology and Eurasian Agglunative Languages,"One thing that I have been thinking on is that linguistics as a science had developed on Indo-European languages which is very natural considering the first scientists were from Europe. So the methodology developed accordingly to traits of Indo-European languages.

I think this may cause some problems in the studies of other language families and maybe the biggest  example to that is Eurasian languages.

Indo-European languages spreaded relatively very recently. There are even common words between Persian and English. Persian and English! Star-sitare, brother-birader, new-nev, name-nam, grass-gars, wine-vin...

I mean 4000 to 1000 BC isnt really that old and actually there were other native civilizations and people in the places Indo-Europeans migrated and became dominant. The reason they came out on top is bound to their invention of horse cars, chariots etc.

So the fundamental evidence that scientists came to the conclusion of one common ancestor for Indo European peoples is that they can reach to a proto-indo european language.

So in linguistics there was this methodology produced that if a proto language can be reached  between languages theorised to be of common origin then they are of common origin.

See where I am coming from? 

This method was built around the researchs on indo european languages which can be a relatively fresh language family. 

So if Eurasian languages for example seperated way before this methodology doesnt really follow. Today as far as I am aware an ultimate Eurasian language is denied in linguistics because they cant reach to an ultimate language like they do in Indo European.

I mean I am sceptic of this because there is a very continuous agglunative language with SOV build area spanning from Anatolia(ancient native Anatolian: Hattian and Urarto-Hurrian were also agglunative) to Sumer from Ural to Japan a very continuous agglunative language area  that spanned all through Asia. Actually even goes further to American continent through Bering Strait. Yes, native american languages were also agglunative suprise suprise!

I dont know how else this is explained in linguistics. Coincidence? Were human masses were more proned to, more inclined to produce agglunative languages and SOV build?

I know that Turkic and Mongolian is today explained with Sprachbund(which I am also sceptic of) but overall yes Turkic and Mongolian peoples have historically been closely affiliated but overall the area I am talking about is so huge! From Anatolia, from Ural mountains to North America via Bering I am talking about.

linguistics,Emphasis in Lists,I’ve noticed that there are certain stereotypical linguistic patterns across given groups that seem to serve as symbols of affinity.

linguistics,How did early printing press affect English,"Here is what I know so far. It led to a boom of literacy. The literacy rate in middle English period was estimated to be 2 percent and after the introduction of the printing press, the literacy rate was estimated to be 60 percent. The printing press acted as a distributor in the process of standardization the English language. I think the selected variety that became the standard was the east midland dialect spoken by the merchant class in London. The reason it was selected was because London was a geographically central location meaning more people were familiar with the dialect, oxford and Cambridge were within 100 km of London and the printing press greatly increased the influence of the selected variety. I am not sure how much of what i said is accurate.",1598908503,ritizzzz,15

linguistics,/ɧ/!!! What kind of a consonant can the infamous /ɧ/ be classified as given its articulatory properties? (Swedish AND Kölsch Ripurian),"The Swedish /ɧ/ seems to behave as a fricated version of /w/ or /ɥ/, depending on the Swedish dialect.

However, the Kölsch dialect of Ripurian (a Germanic dialect or language very similar to German), contains a sound that is described by the IPA symbol /ɧ/ as well. This may be different from the Swedish /ɧ/. In Kölsch Ripurian, /ɧ/ is an allophone of /ʃ/, with the other allophone of this phoneme being /ɕ/. Interestingly enough, we have a consonant /ɧ/, which is not thought of as a sibilant, being an allophone for a sibilant which itself has another allophone that is also a sibilant. It may indicate that the Kölsch /ɧ/ is actually a new and unique kind of sibilant.

What could Swedish and Kölsch Ripurian /ɧ/ be classified as then, given how they are articulated. Particularly the Kölsch /ɧ/ which seems to be treated as a sibilant.",1598902768,chonchcreature,1

Our weekly Q&amp;A thread is the perfect place to post them! A new Q&amp;A thread goes up every Monday, but we have people who read them regularly throughout the week.

**What counts as a “quick question”?**

Any question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate discussion all of the time, here are some examples: 

*Quick questions:*

* Asking for an explanation of a technical term
* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature
* Asking how we would transcribe something
* Asking how a feature works in a particular language

*Not-so-quick questions:*

* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

Also, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first.

linguistics,Spoonerism as wordplay,"In my native language (Vietnamese) spoonerism is a very productive type of wordplay, used by everyone from kid to grandpa (especially to make fun of people's names). The ""rule"" of spoonerism wordplay in Vietnamese is that the onsets, the rimes, and the tones of syllables in a phrase can be switched around and created another phrase with a different meaning.

linguistics,Is the intuitive ability to split words into syllables learnt or somehow innate?,"So I've been thinking of how when I was about 5 years old, we did some tests before being enrolled into elementary school, which involved being tasked to split given words into syllables. Now I don't ever being specifically thaught how to do so, only being able to do it. 

Another thing that is weird to me is that I can intuitivelly, to an extent, split words into syllables in languages I have absolutely no understaning of and have never really been exposed to them (Turkish being an example I looked at in Google translate)

So when does that intuitive understanding come from? Is it derived from some property all the Indo-Europan (I can only speak for myself as Western slav) languages share? Are there languages that don't have the notion of syllables? Are the ones that syllabificate differently that for example English? Or is there something innate in our brains that gives us the understanding of them?

Syllables have always been a weirdly specific thing to me, yet pretty much everyone has an understanding of them.",1598868899,999avatar999,29

linguistics,How to denote tongue width in IPA?,"Pretty self-explanatory really, which is why I'm surprised I didn't find anything online or in the IPA.

Say, pronouncing /l/, you move the tip of the tongue to the alveolar ridge, directing the airflow to the sides of the mouth. However, it looks like there is no way to denote whether you are broadening your tongue or not, and it seems it makes a difference when you pronounce it. 

By broadening the tongue I mean, more area of the tongue touches the alveolar ridge, so the side channels are narrower, in the case of /l/.

Is there any way to denote this, like a diacritic or something?

linguistics,Are diacritics commonly omitted when informally texting in your language?,"I've been wondering about this because I'm mostly only familiar with informal messages in English, a language that doesn't even use diacritics in most forms of communications let alone informal. It's even a hassle because they can't be typed out in regular computer English input methods. I know that in informal text messaging, there are many aspects in the orthography that can deviate from formal writing, and they're meant to be more efficient to type out. For example, typing in all lowercase is popular because that reduces the need to press the shift button; some punctuation is omitted because the message can already be understood without having to type them out; popular abbreviations are used (all lowercase, no punctuation like *brb*) for efficiency. 

So I figured that it'd make sense that a person who types like that in informal messaging would also omit diacritics if it requires pressing more keys or holding down one. For sure English does that extensively (for instance, it's mainly in official contexts that you'd ever see *Pokémon* spelled out the way its company meant it to be spelled). But that's just English, and I'm been trying to find out if that idea is similar in other languages. Searching up often results in conflicting responses such as ""In informal messaging we do sometimes omit the diacritics and we may understand by context, but it's best that you put them in"" or ""It's important to have diacritics because it'll result in misunderstanding"", and so forth. It's confusing to me, especially in the latter example, because informal messaging in English also resulted in mergers (*ur* to mean ""your"" or ""you're""; *ill* to mean ""ill"" or ""I'll) that are still completely understandable via context. Hence I'm curious to know for you guys how diacritics are treated in informal messaging in your language.",1598822721,excusememoi,48

linguistics,Who are our models for second language acquisition? (Does it matter?),"Consider, for a second, running. (This will become pertinent.)

Gym teachers or high-school track coaches trying to improve their charges' running times don't study the running techniques of a pudgy sophomore in a vacuum. They look at somebody like Usain Bolt. While almost none of us are ever going to outrun Usain Bolt no matter how hard we try, he's still using techniques that transfer to anybody trying to improve their speed. The very top slice of runners is used as a model for everyone else. The median runner, the office worker trying to get some exercise in on a Saturday morning, might be studied on purely descriptive grounds to see what the average runners *are* doing, but not on prescriptive grounds to decide what new runners *should* be doing.

It has been a while since I've read Krashen or the other big names in 2LA, but my recollection is that they're doing something rather closer to the latter. There *are* language-learning whizzes out there, and not all of them are necessarily classic savants like Christopher Taylor; some of them are otherwise normal people who are simply quite good at learning foreign languages, like the interpreters who work for the UN. Probably we are looking at a situation rather like running: some of us are dealt a bit more raw talent at language-learning than others, and not everyone is going to (or can) end up at the UN switching between five different languages at C1-C2 level, but the interpreters aren't simply products of innate talent. They're using particular techniques which can be transferred, even if the rest of us mortals will never be able to use them quite as effectively.

But a lot of the 2LA literature, as far as I can tell, is doing more of a spherical-average-learner-in-a-vacuum sort of thing, trying things out on whichever undergrads can be lured to the lab with promises of a Starbucks gift card, rather than seeing what the whiz kids are doing.

I am having trouble understanding speech acts. I understand the concept of speech acts being utterances that do things, but I get lost when Austin switches to illocutionary forces? And then I get MORE lost reading Searle's development! 

So, illocutionary forces are the intention behind a speaker's utterance (and the hearer's acknowledgement of the intention). But, isn't an illocutionary intention necessary for ALL utterances, not just speech acts? So are all utterances speech acts? Especially since Austin dejects the performative/constative distinction, it makes me feel like everything we say can be categorized into the typology of speech acts. Also, how do implicatures differ from indirect speech acts or are implicated meaning a form of illocutionary force?

Does a language's phonology affect the rate of droplet production? Are, say, fricatives or labials or nasals more/less likely to produce them? And would a language with more droplet-producing sounds be more likely to spread the virus than one with fewer, or could it be balanced out by a favorable consonant-vowel ratio?

(I sure that the overall effect would be dwarfed by, for example, the impact from wearing a mask or staying distanced, but I'm also curious about whether the effect would be measurable at all.)

This question may come across as absurd to some, perhaps asinine to others, yet I post this here hoping to get some feedback on the mere plausibility of it. As most astute readers on Gothic likely already know, Crimean Gothic is not directly related, is little attested, and contains very few characters compared to the lexicon necessary to write it. Of course, there is Gothic itself (though I am unsure of the difference in dialect between the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths) except, as far as I know, Ulfilas's Bible and the Skeireins are the only two major sources of the language. That being said, however, taking what we know from those sources, is it possible to borrow from other lesser-known familial branches of Gothic, namely dialects that have roots in North Germanic ***and*** West Germanic (i.e. Faroese, Hessian, Palatine, Flemish, East Pommerian, Highest Alemmanic, Baltendeutsch, etc), to create a hybrid dialect altogether unintelligible by the sum of its collective parts? If I understand it all correctly, would these dialects all have conflicting syntax, morphology, and conjugation, or do they all follow similar, if not identical, rules? Vowels and consonants I think I irrelevant as this exercise is merely stitching together words and phrases. Pragmatics is another thing altogether though...

linguistics,How did Roman Names work?,"Sorry if this isn’t the right subreddit, but, I wanted to know how names worked in ancient Rome. From what I gather, Praenomen were essentially your first name with your Nomen and Cognomen being your last names. Agnomen were a type of cognomen given for performing a good deed or adoption. But, that doesn’t make sense to me, Augustus’s name was “Imperator Caesar Divi Fillius Octavianus Augustus” But Caesar was a cognomen, and the word “Imperator” meant “Victorious commander”, right? So wouldn’t that be an agnomen? And “Divi Fillius Octavianus Augustus” were all a collection of different latin words meaning “Venerable“, “Divine” and “From Octavius”.

linguistics,How ]the word 'magazine' came to mean two different things - a journey of two words,"The most beautiful thing about language is its ability to adapt. Languages evolve over centuries, and that's what makes them beautiful. I read about this a while ago, and thought someone might find it interesting here. 

Part I

'Magazine' has Arabic roots. Trade is a major contributor to acquisition of new words. Medieval Arabia was a trade hot-spot. Arabic is a consonant based language. For example, a 'qitab' is a book, a 'qatib' is a writer, and a 'maqtaba' is a library, with  'q-t-b' being the dominant consonants. Similarly, a maczan was a storage unit - which was used to refer to a collection or a list of caches - an index for goods stored, but in its plural form - maczin. Soon, when it was carried back to the west, the word was stretched too much, to refer to books, registers, and periodic publications called 'magazines'. 

Part II

The second field that contributes to language next to trade is the military. Maczan, as we saw earlier, meant a storage unit, where the soldiers stored their valued goods - gunpowder. This word was also used in its plural form, and was carried back to the west. Even as late as 1900s, castles and fortresses had a 'magazine', as important as a granary, where gunpowder was stored. WHen modern firearms were developed, what  word was chosen to refer to the small unit that stores powder-packed projectiles? That's right. Magazine.",1598294211,Jabberwockkk,2

I've done some research and I know the distinction between the -hez/hoz and the -ben/ban endings have something to do with vowel sounds and whether they're long or not, and the ""remarks about Hungarian pronunciation"" are somewhat helpful. I'm currently assuming that any word with the ü and ö variants naturally have the -ben endings – perhaps meaning they're more stressed and longer? However, the ""acute accent"" part confuses me. Why does ""hím"" have a -ben ending while ""dám"" has a  -ban ending if they both have accented vowels? Following this logic, why does ""cet"" have a -ben ending if it is unaccented and thus shorter? 

Aside from Hungarian grammar tips, I'm also hoping to get some advice on how to tackle this question - how would you solve this question if you didn't know Hungarian?

linguistics,Latvian verbs can have more than 500 different forms,"Hi reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

so lately I've been studying the morphology of Latvian. It a Baltic language spoken in Latvia, a small country in Eastern Europe, by about 2 million people. Latvian is an inflected language with many grammatical categories. What caught my eye was the extremely complex verb morphology that is able to produce an astonishing number of different forms. If you include all the verbal, participial and nominal forms, one verb can yield up to 500 different forms, possibly even more.

Latvian verb has the following characteristics: mood, tense, voice, gender, number, person. There are six tenses, five moods, the active and the passive voice, the masculine and the feminine gender, the singular and the plural number and three persons.

So, combined, we have 36 indicative forms, 10 imperative forms, 4 quotative forms, 2 conditional forms, 3 debitive forms. 55 true verb forms in total.

Then there are the participles. Two participial forms are not declinable, 4 forms decline only for number and gender, and 4 forms are participial adjectives, meaning they decline as true adjectives. The adjective can have 132 different forms (they have the categories of gender, number, case and definitiveness (like the English articles 'the'/'a' but encoded into the ending of the adjective)). The present active, present passive and past passive participles have 132 forms, like the adjective, and the past active participles has only 52. So, 132+132+132+52=448.

There are also two nominal forms that decline like nouns. 14 forms for normal verb and 6 for reflexive.

Some verb can take a reflexive ending. These reflexive verbs and participles have less forms, maybe a few hundred. These forms mirror all the aforementioned forms, except some are missing. I didn't count them, because some of them are archaic and obsolete, but if I did, there would be a total of 700-800 different forms for a single verb.

&amp;#x200B;

Fun fact: to my knowledge, Latvian probably has the most L2 speakers relative to the number of native speakers.I don't have any official data, but I assume that roughly 300k-500k people speak it as L2. These are mostly the ethnic Russians who remained in Latvia after the collapse of the USSR. Given the extremely complex morphology and the fact that Latvian is very different from Russian, Latvian is a much dreaded school subject among Russians. Other languages in a similar situation are Lithuanian and Estonian.

**Humor**. This seems to be a method of exploring the implicit themes in thought or in a relationship. The method of exploration involves the use of messages which are characterized by a condensation of Logical Types or communicational modes. A discovery, for example, occurs when it suddenly becomes plain that a message was not only metaphoric but also more literal, or vice versa. That is to say, the explosive moment in humor is the moment when the labeling of the mode undergoes a dissolution and resynthesis. Commonly, the punch line compels a re-evaluation of earlier signals which ascribed to certain messages a particular mode (e.g., literalness or fantasy). This has the peculiar effect of attributing mode to those signals which had previously the status of that higher Logical Type which classifies the modes....*really, really,* you think so, [you think that's not a good definition?](https://solutions-centre.org/pdf/TOWARD-A-THEORY-OF-SCHIZOPHRENIA-2.pdf)

These things, that I've read these books, these things stand between us, in, too many, important, respects for me to know what to say to you now; you know?

*why am I writing you,* well,

1. I think that I realized something important enough about humor, namely, the second purpose; not the Bateson one, I got that, way early, it's, other use as a validation; the two together, that, makes this a complete theory and I'll be motherfucked if I want to give it to a university for negative-amounts-of-money, but, I also don't know the best way to share this theory with my peers, fellow researchers, in such a way that you'll think, like, *holy fuck,* so, *hey,* this is that, *this is my try, at that, hoping that the common-language will reinforce the gravity of the theory, rather than, undercut it;* **something true does not need to be dressed-up like it is true, to come across as if it were true, do you follow?** *this is, in fact, not only related-to my premise, it's, so related it's very nearly recursive.* They Fuzz up the Pictures to identify what elements are conveying what, more discretely, to say it in human. **Almost-human.**
2. Now that you're familiar with the history, thanks to foucault, the *why it is that humor is banished from the classroom*, isn't it interesting that Humor, so obviously, plays such an important role in learning; I don't even need to reference something in *my present tense, to demonstrate that,* look at my Future, see it? [It's happening right now](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFriedMemes/); they're teaching each other something that they're discovering in the world, which their own lights illuminated; that beauty, is, literally, Truth, and if at a certain density, it's so salient that it's host becomes alive in our eyes? I think that's as simple to prove as a statue, or, someone beautiful, standing, in front of us; I've not known anyone truly beautiful unless there was something truly gorgeous about their character; fully embodied of it, in their apparation, *I don't know,* and here, again, I'm pointing at the boundaries of our, ""academic speech,"" and that they are no where near sufficient to, explain, express, demonstrate the liminalities of our own perpsectives; I can't show you, in a whitepaper, where my lake laps at something dark and  numb and yet I've known to be unempty; you know?

""Though brilliantly sunny, Saturday morning was overcoat weather again, not just topcoat weather, as it had been all week and as everyone had hoped it would stay for the big weekend- the weekend for the Yale game. Of the twenty-some young men who were waiting at the station for their dates to arrive on the ten-fifty-two, no more than six or seven were out on the cold, open platform. The rest were standing around in hatless, smoky little groups of twos and threes and fours inside the heated waiting room, talking in voices that, almost without exception, sounded collegiately dogmatic, as though each young man, in his strident, conversational turn, was clearing up, once and for all, some highly controversial issue, one that the outside, non-matriculating world had been bungling, provocatively or not, for centuries. ""- *I wish life were more like this; wish that mine were.*

It's about a guy, an Irish Guy, saying to, himself, and me, and you, *if the Catholic Church is Not Correct, if the Point of Life is Not, at all, as they describe, then,*

Not, necessarily, *instead of those stories,* unless that's what we're choosing to do; I would recommend against it, seeing as the beautiful and delicate things of this life are all equally fragile; but, *you know.*

Hierarchy is the scale of responsibilities. Since attention is inclined to direct itself upwards and remain fixed, special provisions are necessary to ensure the effective compatibility of equality and hierarchy. ""- Simone Weil, being Right, meaning, Correct, and, It Sure Seems To Me Like It's Either-Or, either, you see things like she does, or, you don't, because we've got what seems to be one tabulator of hierarchy that can be used either way; you know?

I'm going to close with another quote from Simone Weil, and, if anyone feels like they've heard me, thank you, and I feel you too, *I love you too,* I really, true-as-true, do.

There is no area in our minds reserved for [superstition], such as the Greeks had in their mythology; and **superstition, under cover of an abstract vocabulary, has revenged itself by invading the entire realm of thought.** Our [science] is like a store filled with the most subtle intellectual devices for solving the most complex problems, and yet we are almost incapable of applying the elementary principles of rational thought. **In every sphere, we seem to have lost the very elements of intelligence: the ideas of limit, measure, degree, proportion, relation, comparison, contingency, interdependence, interrelation of means and ends.** To keep to the social level, **our political universe is peopled exclusively by myths and monsters; all it contains is absolutes and abstract entities.** This is illustrated by all the words of our political and social vocabulary: nation, security, [capitalism], [communism], [fascism], [order], [authority], [property], [democracy]. We never use them in phrases such as: There is democracy *to the extent that*... or: There is capitalism *in so far as*... **The use of expressions like ""to the extent that"" is beyond our intellectual capacity.** Each of these words seems to represent for us an absolute [reality] unaffected by conditions, or an absolute objective, independent of methods of action, or an absolute [evil]; and at the same time we make all these words mean, successively or simultaneously, anything whatsoever. **Our lives are lived, in actual fact, among changing, varying realities, subject to the casual play of external** **necessities**\*\*, and modifying themselves according to specific conditions within specific limits\*\*; and yet we act and strive and sacrifice ourselves and others by reference to fixed and isolated abstractions which cannot possibly be related either to one another or to any concrete facts. **In this so-called age of technicians, the only battles we know how to fight are battles against windmills.**",1598090638,JonathanPhillipFox,2
linguistics,"Brolese weekly report: Verbal mood, Indicative, Correct Phonology and Preverbs","**WEEKLY REPORT #1**

For some context:

**First post**
https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/i7eqgp/documenting_a_dying_language_brolese/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
So yeah, i am kinda late but i had an hard time organizing all what i documented this week.


This was a rather eventful week.
First of all I spent more time on figuring out the phonology with the help of multiple speakers and a kind redditor and here is what i eventually came up with:

&gt;*Consonants:* p, b, m , f, v, t, d, n, r, s, ʃ, l, ʐ , k, g, ŋ, L, ɲ, t͡ʃ, d͡z

&gt;*Vowels:* a, e, ə, i, o, ɵ, u, y, ʉ

Sorry for it not being a chart, but i am not really proficient in creating those on reddit.

I also started registering the fable ""Pinocchio"" in brolese, but since the only one who had time and was lucid enough to do this is only a semifluent speaker the process is slow and i'd prefer to have more material before posting it and what i got out of it.

So now the real focus of this week and probably of the followings too: verbs.

I started by figuring out what verbal moods were present.

And those are:

&gt;Indicative- mi curi, io corro, i run

&gt;Conditional- mi curesi, io correrei, i would run

&gt;Imperative- cuur!, corri!, run!

&gt;Gerund- curend, correndo, running

&gt;Infinitive- cura, correre, to run

&gt;Participle- curù/cuurs, corrente/corso, runned/that is running*

*the participle is most times the same as the infinitive, exceptions being some (but not all) italian -a verbs (like cura for example) and some really irregular verbs. 

Notice something odd? If you are italian you should.

There is no such thing as a subjunctive mood, and although this is a common feature in many north italian dialects it also means that the dialect has to find a way to supplement for it in the constructions that in latin and italian need it.

Brolese usually simply uses Indicative but in some cases (finals for example) the phrase becomes an Infinitive.

To be exact tho some verbs have rarely used indeclinable subjunctive forms encoding both present and past.

So now we get to tenses ( the conjugation shown is of the verb ""to run"", i obviously documented many other verbs to make sure it is consistent ).
For now i only documented the indicative, wich has the following tenses (the ones in italic need an auxiliary to be formed):

&gt;present, imperfective, simple future, *perfective/recent past*, *pluperfect*, *anterior future*.

Lets take them one by one starting with the present:

&gt; mi curi
&gt; ti corat
&gt; lü'l cuur
&gt; nüi curuma
&gt; vüi curì
&gt; lor a cura

Nothing to say, we already talked about this in the first post.

Now with the imperfective:

&gt; mi cureva
&gt; ti at curevat
&gt; lüi l'cureva
&gt; nüi curevuma
&gt; vüi curevi
&gt; Lor a curevan

Although less used than it is in italian, this is a fairly common tense, encoding the same meaning of imperfective action it encodes in italian, the conjugation is very similar too

Simple future

&gt; mi curarò
&gt; ti at curerè
&gt; lüi al curará
&gt; nüi curaruma
&gt; vüi curarì
&gt; lor curaran

Anterior future

&gt;Mi avrò curù
&gt;Ti te g'avrè cuurs/curù
&gt;Lüi l'avrà curù
&gt;Nui avruma cuurs/curù
&gt;Vui avrì curù/ cuurs
&gt;Lor avran cuurs/curù

Even though the *cuurs* form is more common, it is probably imported from the italian ""corso"", since the *curù* form is remembered to have been the only one when the old speakers were younger.
Also notice how in the second person singular other than tue usual particle in ""t"" (and spoiler i think i finally found out what it is) there is also ""g"", probably from the verb ""mi go"", to have.

And now the pluperfect:

&gt;Mi avea cuurs/curù
&gt;Ti t'ave cuurs/curù
&gt;Lui l'eva cuurs/curù
&gt;Nui evam cuurs/curù
&gt;Viauti avi cuurs/curù
&gt;Lor evan cuurs/curù

But now we get to the best discovery of the week in my opinion: the perfective.
Since there is no distant past tense, that in italian is the main perfective tense, its role is encoded by the Recent past, this being formed by an auxiliary in the present tense and the participle of the verb.

Somehow though in brolese the auxiliary disappeared in most voices, leaving behind either traces of the auxiliary itself or the usual preverbal particle.
This time though other than the usual 2nd singular , 3rd singular and third plural we also have the first plural, and together with the second singular (it is pronounced differently before the verb *to have* like in the pluperfect) it is almost identical to the ""dative"" (yes, i was wrong when i initially stated there are no cases in Pronouns, even though there is no nom-acc distinction) form of the pronoun.
So yes, ""lüi al va"" means ""he at him go"".
And this is why i though those encoded an aoristic meaning: when the object of the sentence is specified the dative preverb isn't obviously used.
I have yet to understand if it is used in value-changing operations, but I'll figure it out.

So yeah here is the conjugation:

&gt;Mi o cultiva

&gt;Ti te cultiva

&gt;Lüi la cultiva

&gt;Nui uma cultiva

&gt;Vui i cultiva

&gt;Lor a cultiva

linguistics,(Need help) Could you please help me with finding American songs that use ontological and structural metaphors?,"Hello there fellow linguists!

I'm currently in the middle of writing my bachelor's for which, to my own demise, I chose topic ""Love metaphors in songs of Dean Martin"", and one of my chapters will be about American songs with said metaphors before the last one which will purely be about Dean Martins' work. I am mainly basing my work on the book ""Metaphors we live by"" by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, which distinguish 3 types of metaphors:

&amp;#x200B;

1.Orientational metaphors (Up-down, deep-shallow, behind-ahead)- to give up, to feel down, to leave past behind.

&amp;#x200B;

2.Ontological Metaphors (Quantifying, Identifying Aspects and causes, setting goals and motivation)- To need a lot of patience, to have too much hostility, to do something out of anger, to seek fame and fortune.

&amp;#x200B;

3.Structural Metaphors (comparing one thing to another in some, however not all aspects)- Love is war.

&amp;#x200B;

However, due to my dumb ass being dyslexic I'm having some trouble in differetiating between ontological and structural metaphors, even though I theoretically know the difference. Could you, please, give me examples of songs with those types of love metaphors in them? Preferable of American origin as it would set the theme for the next chapter being Dean Martin. I don't really care about the genre of the music or times they were created, actually I think that a little of mishmash when it comes to artists and the tone of songs could be interesting.

Let me give you all an example. My child was playing with this pig toy and it was singing “I have a nose...” whereas I would refer to it as a snout.

linguistics,Could PIE actually have four series of velars instead of the conventional three?,"Presently, there're three series of velars generally accepted in PIE studies: \*ḱ, \*k and \*kʷ. The conventional wisdom is that \*ḱ is /c/, \*k is /k/ and \*kʷ is /kʷ/. But the merger of \*ḱ and \*k into /k/ in *centum* languages always felt weird to me. I mean, I'm not sure just how many examples there are in the world of palatal consonants unconditionally changing to velars (if any). Plus, palatals are often traced to palatalized velars (like in Modern Greek, and probably Romance languages, too), and the mere abundence of \*ḱ in PIE seems weird if we take it as a standalone series from plain velars. So the interpretation of \*ḱ, \*k and \*kʷ as /k/, /q/ and /qʷ/ has always felt more natural to me. But here's a thought: it is usually the velars that are prone to combining with labial features, like /w/, so why is there no \*kʷ in this latter interpretation?

And so here comes my proposal: what if there were indeed the /kʷ/ series in addition to all the others? And if so, how can we tell for sure?

Imagine for a second that the real dorsal inventory of PIE is /k/, /kʷ/, /q/ and /qʷ/. We already know that *centum* languages do /k/, /q/ &gt; /k/ and /qʷ/ &gt; /kʷ/, while *satem* languages do /k/ &gt; /c/ and /q/, /qʷ/ &gt; /k/. But if /kʷ/ was also a separate phoneme, what fate would it have in both *centum* and *satem* languages? For *centum* languages the answer is easy: /kʷ/ &gt; /kʷ/. But what of *satem* languages? The /w/ secondary articulation, in my opinion, should strengthen the velar position of the consonant. After all, /w/ is a velaro-labial consonant (as opposed to /ɥ/, the palato-labial consonant). I mean, there is a reason we list /w/ separately in IPA charts. So it seems justified to me that the velarized /kʷ/ should be resistant to palatalization, and thence in *satem* languages we have /kʷ/ &gt; /k/. In that case, the behaviour of /kʷ/ is identical to /qʷ/ for both *centum* and *satem* languages. In other words, the comparative method is unable to distibguish between /kʷ/ and /qʷ/.

So how are we to know if this is at all plausable? I wonder if there's any report on the frequencies of the reconstructed PIE phonemes. If my theory is correct, not only \*ḱ (/k/) should be more frequent than \*k (/q/), but also \*kʷ (both /kʷ/ and /qʷ/) should be more frequent than \*k (just /q/). There's even a chance that /q/ had no velarized counterpart at all, and all instances of \*kʷ are just /kʷ/. In that case, it is also probable that \*kʷ should be more frequent than \*k, since the variants of /k/ should be in general more frequent than /q/, but that's not for sure.

Eventually, kingdom 1 overtakes kingdom 2. Language X becomes the official language and several loans enter language Y. My question goes that if language X continues to influence language Y to the point where major aspects of grammar and vocabulary change, do they still speak the same language? What happens when the language Y is so influenced by language X that they become mutually intelligible, is this creolisation?

If you want to change your destiny for the better.  
 If you want to live up to 200 years old or even longer.  
 If you want to get richer, smarter and look more beautiful/handsome.  
 Then this is a special gift and the most value information you can find on the internet in 2020.  
 

Most people are living based on old traditional and influenced by families, societies rather than the Earth environment and personal choice. You must change your lifestyle if you want to have a better life, there is no any other choice.  
 

I will you give some advice with little change, easy to do but with significant result like a magic wand. This is beyond any education you can receive or have learn so far about life.  
 

**Lifestyle**  
 \- Remove all the hair in your all body as much as possible from legs,hands to any sensitive spot.  
 Because hair are just human body waste just like urine, shit. Unless you want to keep it for fashion,otherwise, there is no any reason to keep it.  
 \- Sleep when the moon is up (before 8 pm), and wake up when the sun start giving the light (around 6-7 am). The healing power is much stronger when the moon is up, and your body will be healed faster better during this time.  
 \- Take a bath 30 – 60 minutes everyday. Swimming pool is better than Bathtub is better than Shower.  
 \- Massage your body with your own hands without any tools.  
 \- Turn off, avoid television, computer, phones as much as possible. Only using it for communication with others or seeking for some information you really looking for.  
 \- Do not take any drugs, medicine, vaccines.  
 

**Diet**  
 You must have an better diet with some time restriction, you cannot eat whatever whenever you want just like those animals. Instead, you should only have 1-2 meals a day, and each meal is within 30-60 minutes.  
 

**An example diet for 7 days you should try:**  
 \- 1 Day: Freestyle eat whatever at whenever you want.  
 \- 2 Day: 1 meal with only fresh raw fruits, vegetable, 1 meal with with cooked foods including both seafood and meat.  
 \- 2 Day 1 meal with raw fresh fruits,vegetables, 1 meal with cooked vegan products only.  
 \- 2 Day: both 2meals only with raw fresh fruits, vegetables.  
 

The amount of foods is up to your choice but eat as little as possible. Meat/seafood should never above 100 gram per meal.  
 Eat a lot of spicy/bitter/sour fruits, leafs as possible, they are the natural “cure” for all kind of virus, bacteria, toxin in human body.  
 Eat a lot of green leafs as possible, try green smoothie.  
 You can pick the eating hour/day you like and match with your daily business.  
 

**Foods you should avoid:**  
 \- GMOs foods, foods contain artificial chemicals such as processed foods.  
 \- Raw or medium rare meat. All should be well done cooked.  
 \- Coffee, tea.  
 

Above is the magic formula you should give it a try right now if you want to change your destiny for the better.  
 Words are meaningless, science are crap, the only thing real is real life results.  
 

I can guarantee you can live up to 200 years old with just a simple formula like above.  
 

If you have any questions related to human health, lifestyle, you can ask me at forum **freejoy.aimoo.com** but only till **17/08/2020.**  
   
 The only thing can prove me as the real Savior is via real life result,all kind of words are meaningless. Give it a try to check guys gals !!!

linguistics,Evidence of language-learning aptitude among specific ancestries of speakers? Study ideas,"I have been wondering for a while if it is at all possible to prove whether or not people who descend from a given population of speakers in any amount (both cell lines 100%, only one, or many smaller possible fractions between both) are more capable and prepared for the learning of a language that their ancestors spoke either as a native or an L2+, whether they are being taught by their parents/guardians during childhood or at any point later on. That linguistic structures for specific languages or language families are heritable. Has this ever been studied before? I know that research has been done on genetic bases for language aptitude in general, but I am not sure about genes that could encode for the acquisition of specific languages. I was only able to find [this](https://www.mpg.de/19395/Language_genetics) under the subheading ""structural differences"" where it describes alleles that appear to be shared among people with ancestors who speak tonal languages such as Chinese, and how certain genes such as these may give rise to the formation of new languages that share similar properties. 

Are there implications for language preservation for the future? Language planning? Does it invalidate universal grammar or would it serve as a meaningful addendum? I have been thinking about conditions for a long-term experiment and questions for research, and am curious if anyone else can think of any proper method of studying this-

\----

It would require a group of participants both children and adults, with no identifiable language learning impairments and willing/motivated to learn another language. 

They would submit dna/genetic information and based on the results, a pool of languages would be selected based on resources/availability of learning materials and presence in the genealogies of the participants. They can't have been exposed geographically or environmentally to speakers of their chosen language, to rule out factors that are not innate.

I was imagining that if people within this group who shared genetic backgrounds consistent with the language they are learning were tested/compared against each other that meaningful data might be extracted that considers factors that influence degree of success in terms of proficiency.

**Pertinent questions/factors:**

1. What is the effect, if any, on larger or smaller amounts of dna from specific linguistic regions and achieving some level of proficiency? I.e. if someone who is one hundred percent descended from a set of speakers is more or less successful than someone who only has ancestry from one parent, or grandparent, or some smaller fraction, so on and so forth. How to determine margin for error if impossible to tell exactly what language an ancestor may have spoken or been exposed to in a multilingual area, or if they migrated, etc.
2. Does the generational location of a group of ancestral speakers have any kind of effect? Whether or not a person is more recently related to these speakers or more distantly...i.e a person with a grandparent on both sides who are 50% chinese vs. a person who has a half-chinese parent and a non-chinese parent, and similar ""equivalencies"" up the timeline
3. Being in a monolingual vs. multilingual environment? such as in [this UW study](https://www.washington.edu/news/2019/09/05/study-shows-exposure-to-multiple-languages-may-make-it-easier-to-learn-one/)
4. Any other genes that have correlations with language learning ability
5. Linguistic/genetic environments born or lived in that contrast with or are not shared with the speaker such as adoptees
6. Things that inhibit a person from accessing this theoretical genetic information? Why it might be harder for one person from a line of a group of speakers may find it difficult over another, etc.
7. Age of participant? Fluency in other languages? Bilingualism?
8. Is there a threshold where a certain amount of genetic information is influential and anything below is useless? Related to question 1. Does it not exist until later in life or is it present from birth?
9. Is different information encoded for languages that have more complex spoken vs. written components? Can information from signed languages be inherited?

Thanks in advance, I'm not sure if this is worthwhile due to UG saying that everyone is predisposed to being able to learn anything, which for sure would account for the inverse of this proposal (i.e. in the case of baby adoptees with vastly different genetics than their adoptive parents) -- if it is useful at all in this era of globalization and the multitude of resources available, and what the value, if any, of knowing whether or not people have an advantage of being more primed to learn a language of a set of their own ancestors over someone else's is. I can see the potential for eugenics-related and genetic privacy nightmares if there was any validity to this in a distant dystopian future. I am wondering if it is more relevant (and less dangerous) to determine not what could cause people to inherit usable linguistic information from their ancestors, but what would work against it both genetically and epigenetically. It might answer a lot of culture/language-instilling parents' and grandparents' headaches? Make them worse? idk",1597805611,brunostogwaffel,3

To be honest I don't completely understand the difference between a mora and a syllable (from what i understand syllables would be broken up as wa-ter-mel-on while moras would be broken up as wa-t-er-m-el-on)

I found several studies calling Telugu mora based including [this one](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221483780_Measuring_basic_tempo_across_languages_and_some_implications_for_speech_rhythm) which attributed the quick pace of the language to being mora based and [this one, which compared Telugu and Japanese on the premise they are mora based](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6314769_Perceptual_Tests_of_Rhythmic_Similarity_I_Mora_Rhythm) (i also found this [powerpoint](http://www.linguaakshara.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Rhythmic_similarities_in_speech_segmentation_Murty.3190559.pdf) which I suspect was made for the previous study)

* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature
* Asking how we would transcribe something
* Asking how a feature works in a particular language

*Not-so-quick questions:*

* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

linguistics,Help me find this study!,"A few semesters ago in one of my linguistics classes I remember us watching a video of a study that was essentially a model of creolization.

Linguists assigned random made up names to little icons, then told a subject to memorize it. The subject then was supposed to teach it to another subject, and so on, like a game of telephone, each changing little bits of information inadvertently. (I think.)

The point was to demonstrate that, while the initial input was random and patternless, over time the words would develop root and derivational morphemes, and become more standardized (much like how a rough pidgin becomes a smoother, more standardized creole).

linguistics,What are some concepts that could could be represented by true ideograms?,"**Short Version**: *I’m trying to figure out what are some concepts that can be represented by true ideograms?*

So, as you know, writing systems like Chinese, Kanji, Hieroglyphics, etc. typically use “logograms” to represent a single word, rather than “ideograms” which represent an abstract concept that isn’t directly tied to language.

I’m guessing that the problem with labeling these characters as “ideograms” is that individual languages carry subtle nuances to them so that the specific idea can never be fully applied to other languages? For instance, you might translate the Chinese word “ding” (鼎) as “cauldron” in English. However, “ding” refers to a specific class of ritual artifacts in China, and does not address the association that the word “cauldron” has with witchcraft.

However, know KNOW that true ideograms can exist, because we use them for written numbers. In other words, the symbol “8” might be called by totally different words in different languages, but it can only mean one possible thing: the concept of the number “eight”.

So basically I’m trying to figure out what other concepts have an objective definition behind them that is not directly attached to language. Any ideas?",1597603756,Throwaway46676,5

I didn't speak any language until 3, my parents got worried and only switch the only the L1 language. However understanding was ok in both languages. I proceed to only be able to output in the L1 language. 


Since many, if not all phonetics and subtle sounds in language are acquired at ages 1-3, wouldn't I carry the ability to hear the L2 extremely well. And this would cause my perceived accent in L2 to be greater than a ""normal"" learner, if I were to choose to learn the L2. 



I'm just curious about the science behind it because I have seen the case where many Heritage speakers have really great accents in the L2 if they decide to learn it. Many have great accents to the point where they are mistaken as a native. Frankly, I have never really worked on my accent in my L2 yet I get mistaken for a Native quite often.

linguistics,"English diphthongs /aɪ/, /eɪ/, /ɔɪ/ as /ai/, /ei/, /ɔi/ - is my pronunciation regional?","When I first learned the fact that the ""long vowels"" I had been taught in school were in fact not single vowels, but diphthongs, I was pleasantly surprised. I was even more surprised by the fact that almost every single list of American English vowel diphthongs I can find lists these diphthongs:
I /aɪ/, ay /eɪ/, oy /ɔɪ/
With the ""short I"" /ɪ/ as in my pronunciation of ""bit, ship, writ, mitt"". This is very confusing to me, because I have listened to myself closely, and I have always pronounced the pronoun ""I"" as, as far as I am able to tell, [ai] and not [aɪ]. If I read a list of diphthong example words and truly pronounce the second vowel in the diphthong as /ɪ/, it comes across to me as sounding not ""bland, common 'general' American"" but instead as something like a Southern or perhaps Australian accent. For example ""light"", which I pronounce /lʌit/ and hear as ""luh-eet"" in rough phonetic spelling, is listed in dictionaries as being pronounced /lʌɪt/ or /laɪt/, which to my ear comes across as ""luh-it"", and doesn't sound like my dialect. Similarly, saying ""I"" as /aɪ/ sounds more like what is usually written as eye-dialect in some books as a southern ""Ah"", than what I consider the ""standard"" or ""correct"" pronunciation.

Am I missing something? Why is it that I have seemingly always heard these diphthongs as containing a very distinct [i] at the end, yet I do not find this transcription anywhere I can find? Is the [ɪ]-containing pronunciation actually much more common, and I'm somehow missing it? Or is this a feature of my personal accent?

linguistics,Have any linguists studied the Lay-Lie merger?,"This has me really curious. Back in high school I remember my English teacher drilling into my head the need to make correct distinctions between “Lie Down” and “Lay Down” to prep for the ACT. Lie Down is intransitive whole Lay Down is transitive, that’s how the two words came to be in English. They can be quite confusing, as the past tense of Lie Down is Lay Down, and the past tense of Lay Down is Laid Down. The ACT/SAT often test on this tricky pair, so we had to study it pretty hard to get it right. I always thought about how in normal English speech, I personally hardly EVER make a distinction. I virtually never use “Lie Down”, and always use Lay Down, regardless of the verb being transitive or intransitive. As such, I’ve never in my entire life said “I lay down on my bed” when speaking of the past tense, and have ALWAYS said “Laid Down” (eg I laid down on my bed) to the point where the supposed correct version sounds unnatural and incorrect to me.

I realized over time that NO ONE I know makes this distinction, and on the rare occasion they do, they are usually very old. Clearly this is a golden example of a lexical merger! Yet standardized tests and “proper English” requires us to continue to make the distinction even though no one speaks like this anymore.

If Italian, French and Spanish are all evolved from Latin, when did people stop calling their language ""Latin""?

I then realised that it's far more complex than that. For example, Italy doesn't just speak ""Italiano"", it also speaks dialects like ""Vèneto"" and ""Sicilianu""; France doesn't just speak ""Français"", but also dialects like ""Lenga d'òc"" and ""Normand""; and Spain doesn't just speak ""Español"", but also dialects like ""Català"" and ""Galego"". How and when did people decide to start calling Latin these new names as their languages evolved?

Also, I then realised that Germanic languages have an equally interesting story:

* How and when did ""*Sprechen sie Deutsch?*"" (German for ""*Do you speak German?*"") turn into ""*Do you speak English?*"" or ""*Spreek je Nederlands?*"" (Dutch for ""*Do you speak Dutch?*"")
* English is still called ""English"" by all its speakers despite the wide range of accents and the different identities of Anglophone nations (such as ""American"" or ""Australian"") developing over the last 300 years; while in the same time period, Dutch evolved a new branch language called ""Afrikaans"".

linguistics,Clarification on a conversion identification exercise,"Greetings, fellow linguists, 

I am currently working on an exercise in linguistics, but the phrasing of the requirement is giving me sort of a hard time, which is hindering my progress on the actual task.  

Essentially, I have a brief excerpt from a text, and I am to *identify examples of converted words* in that text. 

So far, so simple. However, there are several words in that text which here may not be the *result* of conversion, but certainly *have been converted in general*.

One such example is the word *benefit,* which here is a noun. Of course, it is frequently used in its converted form of *(to) benefit,* even if this is not the case here. 

This is where my problem lies. Would you argue that 

a) the task only wants me to name words in the text which are clear examples of having been converted from others

or 

b) can I isolate a word and identify it as converted if I know it has been converted *in general*? 

&amp;#x200B;

In the first case, some of the words in text are probably meant to be misleading.

I've seen many gaming keyboards that have LED lights underneath the keys, but is it possible to make a keyboard where the lights themselves show the letters and they can be customized based on your language input? The keys themselves would be blank and the lights underneath would change every time you change some form of setting, and there would be templates for different languages that you can download off the internet.

For example, I'm currently studying Norwegian, French, and Russian, and some different keys are added in Norwegian and French, but for French, some other keys are moved around, and I need to just memorize what those keys are on my American keyboard. This problem is made even more difficult with Russian, which has a completely different writing system.

I know that there are separate keyboards that you can buy that are for each of these languages, but I want to potentially get rid of the middle man and come up with a keyboard design that changes the letters on the keys depending on the language you want to type in.

Sadly, I don't know anything about computer design or how keyboards really work, so I'm putting this idea out there in case anyone reading this knows what they're talking about and could make this a thing.",1597344279,_The_Blockhead,28

linguistics,"What would it mean to give African American Vernacular English formal, legal recognition as a minority language? How might that work in schools and in society?","I hope this is appropriate for r/linguistics. I'm asking about language policy rather than how a particular language works. 

In many other countries, minority languages have some kind of official recognition. Parents can send their children to schools that teach in Basque, Romansch, or Gaelic for example. You can address the Canadian parliament in French. 

Obviously AAVE has none of these protections, but it’s also in a different situation linguistically from many minority languages, being so closely related to and mutually intelligible with standard English. 

If an American state with a large AAVE-speaking population decided to recognize it as an official language and incorporate it into education, how might that work out?  I have a lot of questions!

* Could AAVE be practically used as the medium of education in schools? What would need to happen for that to be done?
* Would it need to have a standard, written version (or does such a standard already exist)? 
* Could AAVE be taught to non-speakers in a formal way, or is this unnecessary because it is mutually intelligible with standard English?  
* Is there any recent precedent for American schools in which standard English isn't the language of instruction? 

On a broader level, I'd also like to know how official recognition has worked out for speakers of minority languages in different countries. Obviously recognition has effects on language preservation, but I'm more interested in whether it can raise the status of a stigmatized language and its speakers.

linguistics,Reliability of data from less well-studied languages,"Hi all,

I did an MA in linguistics a few years ago. I've forgotten much and I'm not really au fait with the field these days. But this morning, I had a (literal) shower thought about a syntactic conundrum in my native language and decided to check if there were any papers addressing the issue. I found a couple by the same person, published within the past decade, and it looked like they were, broadly speaking, approaching the same conclusion as my wandering thoughts — but with much more of a theoretical framework, of course.

However, I found that there were a bunch of problems with the data from my native language. General claims about the language, glosses and inapplicable examples. Here are some of my reactions:

'No, those aren't the only permitted consonants in a coda. Hell, you'll find a couple more if you just run through your personal pronouns.'

'That's not what that sentence means. Comparatives don't work exactly as in English. You ended up saying X's clothes are whiter than Y, not whiter than Y's clothes.'

'True, the second reading of that sentence is impossible. But only because that particular word for 'old' is never used to refer to the age of human beings, not because of the rule you proposed. A similar construction with another word from that category would be fine for both readings.'

Then I came across an example from a related language. I don't speak it, but that construction just seemed unlikely to me from the parallels I knew, and I was already suspicious, so I checked with a native speaker. And indeed, it wasn't valid. 

Now, many of these things wouldn't really affect the thrust of the argument — but some would. I got the impression that the author was a heritage speaker based at a foreign university with a less-than-perfect command of my language, and I have no idea where the examples from the other language came from. 

Have you ever come across such issues in a published academic paper? I imagine it doesn't happen much with very well-studied languages like English, but with others it seems possible that someone could be cavalier with the data and nobody reading the work would know the languages well enough to spot it.",1597257329,rm698,5

linguistics,Does the fact that Hittite has vast differences to PIE imply a much earlier emergence date for PIE?,"I was reading ""Aryans"" by the prominent early 20th century Archaeologist Gordon Childe and during the writing of his book, it was not very clear that the Hittite was an Indo-European language. As one of his arguments, he proposes that the Hittite has so many differences that for these differences to occur from PIE there was just not enough time. He argues that if Hittite existed in 14th century AD instead of 14th century BC, then he says everyone would be willing to accept it as IE as there would be enough time for deviations and corruptions. I know his ideas are fairly outdated and the book is not so much of a linguistics book. However, now that it is clear Hittite is indeed an IE language, then how do we explain his criticism that there was not enough time for PIE to evolve into Hittite? Could this mean PIE ""existed""/""emerged"" well earlier than it had been thought in his time?",1597188677,entropy0x0,23

https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/i7eqgp/documenting_a_dying_language_brolese/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

**Proof this isn't a conlang**
https://www.reddit.com/user/pomomarp/comments/i7mg7g/proofs_that_brolese_exists/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

First of all I would like to thank all the people that supported and helped me in the first post about brolese, it means a lot to me.


Before we start with the proper documentation here are some reminders:\n
*i am only 16, i do not do this professionally and probably not in the best way; i am not a native speaker nor a very proficient one; i do not mean that Brolese is drastically different from every dialect around it or a super special language, just that it is close to be unintelligible for people speaking dialects such as Quarnese or Omegnese (so spoken around (5/6 kilometers away) and visibly different even if mostly intelligible from Noniese (1km~).*

So... lets get into it.



**PLURALS** \n   here are the definitive rules for pluralizing in brolese:    *when a word ends with a consonant that is not ""l"" it just adds -i or does not change*\n     *when a word ends with ""l"" it loses it before adding -i*\n     *when a word ends in vowel -a it gets lost and -i is not added*    \n -there are no words ending in a vowel that is not ""a"".



**TENSES**\n    *Brolese*-english-italian *Sta matin sum livá sü*     this morning i got up. \n   Questa mattina mi sono alzato.

*Mi levi sü tuti matin* \n   i wake up every morning.  \n  Mi sveglio ogni mattina.

*Am levi sü* \n   I am waking up.\n     Mi sveglio

*Speča natim ca levi sü*   \n I'll get up soon, wait a moment.    \n Aspetta un attimo che mi alzo.

*Am leverò*   \n i'll wake up. \n   Mi alzerò.


*I did this only with the verbs to wake up and to eat, so there is the possibility of them being irregular in the same way(?)*

So, observations:    \n You'll notice that when in the abitual present to wake up uses ""Mi"", in the real present it uses ""Am"", well this doesn't happen in to Eat, so it is safe to say there is no distinction between them. \n     The change i noticed is instead that in the third person plural the ""a"" used before some verbs is used to give aorisric valency. \n   This meaning that those particles have more than the sole purpose of valency changer, this may be a much complex thing than i thought it would be (and probably many different things), but i am sure i'll eventually figure it out.

I also noticed a distinct imperative and conditional mood, probably there is also s subjunctive one.
Were for the imperative case i can't tell what kind of desinence is used, the conditional present is:

&gt;Mi mangeresi   \n Ti tal  Manjares  \n  Lüi manjeres   \n Nüi manjeresam    Vüi Manjerest \n   Lor/Lür al Manjeresan

*of the verb to eat*



**FUTURE AND NEGATIVES** \n    *Mi qula scigula lì la mangi mia.*   \n *Mi manjarò mia qula scigula.*

I have no intention to eat this onion.   \n I won't eat this onion.

&gt;Lit: I that onion there to eat not. \n   I to eat not that onion 


Ye... not really much to say about it, apart from the strange syntactical construction in the negative form and the fact that the future tense is almost identical to italian:

&gt;Mi mangiarò.  \n   Ti at Manjarai.\n     Lüi al Manjarà.  \n   Nüi Manjerem. \n   Vüi Manjeret^reconstructed.\n    Lor Manjəran.

I will try to explain the situation by giving some background information.   


My girlfriend has a three year old niece. The mother is Chinese and the father dutch. The parents communicate mostly using the English language.   
They try to raise the girl bilingual. Her mother usually speaks Chinese or English to her daughter.   
Her father tries to speak as much English to his daughter as possible so she learns the language form an early age.  (Both parents have a C1 - C2 level English, if that's the correct way to put it.)

  
Since the three year old niece goes to daycare, she is exposed to the Dutch Language a lot.  
Last weekend we visited them for a birthday and the girl is getting quite chatty! After a while I discovered she constantly switches form Dutch to Chinese and sometimes she uses some English words. She has a hard time pronouncing the Dutch letter ''L'' and ''S'' in a correct way.

linguistics,What do we know about the lack of a Jewish Slavic language/dialect and the seeming lack of Jewish influence on native Slavic languages? Are there any examples of influences or dialects that aren't well-known? Is there any literature available?,"Note: this is not the thread to discuss the bogus ""MoDeRn HeBrEw iS sLaViC!11"" theory.

For this I will be focusing mainly on modern languages and dialects.

So as Jewish communities spread around the world due to various expulsions and persecution, they developed their own versions of the local languages. These languages had varying degrees of mutual intelligibility with the languages of the natives; ranging from very high (Ladino) to quite low (some dialects of Aramaic and Yiddish). What distinguishes these Jewish languages from their non-Jewish counterparts is usually various grammatical features, including Hebrew or Aramaic words, pronunciation differences and others. They are (and were) almost exclusively spoken by Jews, who were usually ""bilingual"" in the language of the natives they lived amongst, which was sometimes a related language (like German and Yiddish, or Judeo-Arabic and Arabic), but sometimes unrelated (like Uzbek and Bukhari, or Azerbaijani and Juhuri).

There are many recognised Jewish languages/dialects from multiple language families, including (but not limited to):

- **Afro-Asiatic**

- *Semitic*

- Jewish Eastern neo-Aramaic (many dialects, many of which are not mutually intelligible), Juedo-Arabic (many dialects, most of which are not mutually intelligible)

- *Cushitic*

- Qwara

- *Berber*

- Judeo-Berber (many dialects)

- **Indo-European**

- *Germanic*

- Yiddish (with multiple dialects)

- *Romance*

- Ladino (Judeo-Spanish), Judeo-Italian, Judeo-Piedmontese, Haketia, Tetuani Ladino, Shuadit, 

- *Iranian*

- Bukhori (Judeo-Tajik), Juhuri (Judeo-Tat), Judeo-Hamedani

- *Indo-Aryan*

- Judeo-Marathi

- *Hellenic*

- Yevanic

- **Turkic**

- Krymchak, Karaim

- **Dravidian**

- *Judeo-Malayalam*

- **Kartvelian**

- Kivruli (Judeo-Georgian)

Extinct in the middle Ages:

- **Slavic**

- Knaanic


As we can see, there has never been a modern Jewish Slavic language or dialect. Additionally, there has only been one Jewish Slavic language ever - a west-Slavic language - that disappeared in the late Middle Ages.

Prior to WW2 and the Holocaust, the majority of the world's Jews had migrated to Slavic-speaking Eastern and Southern Europe. There were huge Jewish communities in Poland, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Czechia, Slovakia and Bulgaria, as well as significant communities in Bosnia, Croatia, North Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia. There were also huge communities in non-Slavic regions like Romania and Hungary.

However, none of these communities seem to have developed their own dialects of the native languages. In the majority of these communities, Yiddish (Germanic) was the spoken language of the Jewish community. In Bulgaria, Serbia, Bosnia and others, Ladino (Romance) was the spoken language. 

As someone with heritage in these communities, I have heard varying things about attitudes towards the native languages. I've been told that in the case of my grandmother (born in Poland), Yiddish and Hebrew were the only languages allowed in the synagogue and usually in the home, too; Polish was learned at school, and thereafter only allowed outside and at school. I have heard similar stories from older people who were born in other countries mentioned here, though a minority of families were much more assimilated and even spoke the local native language at home.

What strikes me is that despite several centuries of living in Slavic-speaking lands, the situation remained where Jews preferred to keep their Germanic-based and Romance-based Jewish languages and learn the local language on top of this, rather than developing their own Jewish version of it. 

I've heard varying reasons for this. Mostly it seems to come down to push and pull factors: a spiritual/emotional pull towards tradition of Yiddish and Ladino, and a push away from it by anti-Semitism among the local non-Jews. This created the feeling that the only reason to learn the Slavic language was to engage in essential (but maybe rare) communication with non-Jewish neighbours and officials. 

This would also explain the limited Jewish influence on Slavic languages, despite Jews making up the majority of several major cities in Slavic-speaking lands and very large minorities in many others.

The one notable exception that I can think of is the Odessa dialect - which may be fading out under standardisation. This language is based on Russian, but has significant Ukrainian and Yiddish influences. This seems to be a well-known fact about the Odessa dialect, but I can't find too much literature on it (at least in English).

I'm aware that there were also some Yiddish/Hebrew influences on German and Polish, but again - not very well-studied, and seemingly unknown to Poles and Germans.",1597105948,ishgever,4

We can see one of the ""rules"" for speaking in a British accent: when you have two syllables separated by a ""t"" sound, just separate the syllables instead (""little"", ""British"", ""Scottish"", but maybe there are exceptions?). If I just follow this one rule, I can say a few things in a British accent. Most of the advice I get is to just listen to a voice and try to emulate it. For me, it's hard to just ""copy"" a voice that I listen to, it's much easier if I have a set of rules to just follow. Plus, if there are rules to speaking in different accents it would be fun to study them.

Is there a way to learn the rules on how to speak in different accents/voices, or any resources that might be useful?",1597020165,MouseCylinder,1
linguistics,Sonority Hierarchy Reversals and Plateaus: A consistent framework?,"Hello! I've been looking for a consistent framework or a set of universals to use when designing the phonotactics of conlangs and I haven't been able to find anything super great. The best thing I've been able to find is the idea of the Sonority Hierarchy and how the phonemes in a syllable tend towards being more sonorous as you approach the syllabel nucleus from either side. However, all of the resources I've seen have been quick to point out that this isn't universal and cite words like ""spa"", where /s/ and /p/ are either the same or decreasing sonority depending on the specific hierarchy you use.

The thing is, they then give no explanation as to *why* these plateaus/reversals can occur. It seems to me that there should be some clusters which are universally disallowed in natural language. Like, if my phonotactics allowed the cluster /it/ in an onset, then I could have the ""syllable"" /itu/, which is obviously not one syllable, but two. Is it just a question of the difference in sonority so that ""s"" and ""p"" are pretty close, but ""a"" and ""t"" are about as far apart as possible, or is there some other rule that I can use? Any resources/papers that you know of that I could read would also be great. Thanks!",1597010048,Plyb,1
linguistics,"I'm working with a possible mis-identification or relabeling of the Well Shaft within the Great Pyramid at Giza possibly being the name of two completely different shafts which have become interchanged throughout history over the course of 2,300 years.","In response to claims that the Pit Shaft in the Great Pyramid at Giza does actually connect to the Nile via an underground tunnel I have been asked the following question.

&gt;How do you address that these shafts were supposedly carved by early researchers trying to determine if something was buried under the center of pyramid? 

That is the official story, yes.  The story goes that in the early 1800s the explorer Caviglia was assigned to the Great Pyramid after his gantastic work with the Sphinx.  This guy was meticulous.  He arrived at the G Pyramid far after the limestone casing had been removed(Herodotus's visit in 2,500 saw the G P with the limestone casing still on, though I believe the capstone was gone already?  I'll look into that later.) Anyways, this Caviglia guy was arrived at the GP at a time when the interrior was host to a tremendous number of bats and when sand had been blowing right into the exposed entrances for a thousand years on the robber's tunnel and up to 2,500 years on the main entrance...I have no idea when the main entrance was exposed, but it might have been discovered over 2,000 years ago(someone give me a link on this of you have it).  So the place was a mess.  The Subterranean chamber was inaccessible and the Well Shaft was plugged.  There was a large granite plug which originally hid the top entrance of the Well Shaft which had been pushed into the hole, blocking it some 1/4 of the way down.  The opening of the Well Shaft at the top entrance is of note because the stones about where the concealing stone was removed had chisel marks which could only have been made from the top.  This indicates that the Well Shaft could not have been successfully maneuvered until after the Robber's Tunnel was carved in 820 under Al Ma'mun's (Mamoun?) direction.

I'll drop a couple quotes here.

Pliny, the Elder: a Roman philosopher AD23

&gt;In the largest pyramid, there is an eighty-six cubit well inside; it is thought the river is let in by it.

http://lexitechnia.frath.net/2008/03/pliny-on-the-well-shaft/

This quote is of significance because it indicates several things.  (1)That the main entrance was open at this time.  (2) that the Pit Shaft, as we know it today, was once called the Well Shaft.  (3) Either he is quoting Herodotus on the Pit Shaft connecting to water, or he heard it elsewhere.  (5) The shaft existed 2,000 years ago, 1800 years before Caviglia claimed to have dug the Pit Shaft.  (6) as the Robber's Tunnel was not dug until 820AD, Pliny's account is from the lower section of the Great Pyramid and the Well Shaft we know today goes up to a point above the surface, and further up into the G Pyramid therefore it is impossible that it could connect to a river as only a shaft which goes down could do that(i.e. the Pit Shaft).

Right, back to the story: Caviglia allegedly dug some 11 meters of Pit Shaft, and then later was hired by Col. Vyse for a couple years and they continued digging.  Allegedly deepening the Pit to a total of some 20 meters.  After they found no treasure they filled the Pit Shaft with all their trash.  Yes, they were allegedly digging for treasure.  Here I should note that pirates bury treasure where you can use a shovel as holes can be filled in, but in solid bedrock: not so much.  It is highly unlikely that any treasure hunting would be conducted by mining a fresh shaft through virgin bedrock for previously burried treasure.  It just doesn't make any sense.  Anyways, the filling in of the Pit Shaft was very unlike the meticulous nature of Caviglia who is accredited with being festidiously clean.  His treatment of the G Pyramid is something we could aspire to today, but under Vyse it seems that it all turned around and their time together was short for a difference of ideals.  You can see pictures of it on my sub r/ClearThePitShaft, but to this day the Pit Shaft remains burried.

Oh, right.  I was going on about the Well Shaft for a reason.  Next quote is from Al Mamoun, 820AD, after the digging of the Robber's Tunnel and first access to the upper section of the G Pyramid:

&gt;...there was no treasure...this most ancient and precious of cupboards was completely bare. There were not only no burial artifacts, but no burial and no inscriptions either! The first thought to cross the mind of the Caliph must have been that the ‘tomb’ had been robbed. But how? Even if the secret ‘Well Shaft’ deep inside the pyramid had been found at this stage, it is hardly a suitable tunnel through which to strip a wealthy burial chamber totally bare. So where was all the loot?

https://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places-africa/tunnel-vision-mysterious-forced-entry-caliph-great-pyramid-giza-001812

A bit of a lengthier one, but I continue here with the observations that (1)The Well Shaft we know today could not have been discovered until after Al Mamoun's carving of the Robber's Tunnel(see quote three).  The Well Shaft that Al Mamoun must therefore be referring to is nothing other than the Pit Shaft! (2) This is 1,000 years before Caviglia's expedition and his alleged mining in the G Pyramid.  (3) a later quote in this post gets into greater detail on how the Well Shaft we know today could not have been opened until after 820AD.

A quote about the Pit Shaft, Abdallah Muhammed bin Abd ar-Rahim al Kaisi in Al Mamoun's time wrote:

&gt;In the middle of this chamber is a square well pit of 10 ells depth. If one steps down there one sees a door on any of its four sides

http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/ghizahistoricaccounts.htm

This accounting indicates that (1) the Pit Shaft once was covered by a trap door at the bottom of The Pit.  (2) Trap doors cover shafts, and Caviglia claims that there was originally nothing beneath where the trap door once was.  (3) pictures of the Pit Shaft show a piece of the trap door sill remaining, perched on the edge of the Pit.

From the same source as above, John Greaves wrote a 800 years later that:

&gt;At the end of it (The Ascending passage), on the right hand, is the well mentioned by Pliny: which is circular, not square, as the Arabian writers describe'. He published his investigations under the title, 'Pyramidographia: A Description of the Pyramids in Egypt (1646).

This is a rather disingenuous quote in my opinion as Pliny was not referring to the Well Shaft as discussed earlier, but rather to the Pit Shaft.  (1) The Pit Shaft is square while the Well Shaft is rounded in places.  I don't know who ""the Arabians"" are, but they seemed to be talking about the Pit Shaft as well.  (3) 

This quote from Strabo, 1st century CE is exactly contrary to the works of Herodotus from 500 years before then:

The Great Pyramid has at some height on one of its faces a stone which can be removed and which, when raised, gives access to a sloping gallery to the foundations.

https://www.wonders-of-the-world.net/Pyramids-of-Egypt/Explorations-of-the-pyramids-of-Giza.php

Regarding the Well Shaft:

&gt;'There is incontrovertible evidence that the well Shaft is an original feature that was dug from the top downï¿½a close examination of the chisel marks on the topside of the blocks that surround the upper entranced to the shaft reveals that it was chiselled out from above'.

http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/Ghizaarchitecture.htm

This is important because it means that the Well Shaft was discovered after the Robber's Tunnel was dug in 820AD.


Strabo allegedly found a door on the side of the G Pyramid.  If this is true then it is likely that nothing which Herodotus wrote is true, or that the G Pyramid had two entrances, the hinged door and a tunnel to the nile.  This gheory elates most ""Great Pyramid Water Machine"" theorists because the hinged door could easily be the major output of a ram pump.  Fun stuff.  

It may be that the Pit Shaft was so packed with dirt and clay and sand and rock in 1817 that it seemed as though to outside observers that Caviglia was digging the Pit Shaft, but in reality was only clearing it of rubble.  

Missing quote: Herodotus wrote a lot.  He said that he was told that a tunnel from the Nile connected to the Great Pyramid.  The Pit Shaft is the only shaft which has the potential to do that, but we won't know until we stop relying on the works of the long dead and go look for ourselves.

Missing quote: I once read that Caviglia had to remove a block to expose the lower end of the Pit Shaft, which until then had been backfilled with sand.  Its not very important, but could explain why Al Mamoun never located the Well Shaft, as he never directly references it and it could only have been opened until after his tunneling, even if the lower entrance had been discovered, as to climb up that Well Shaft and then push that granite plug up and out would be next to impossible.  The Well Shaft twists and turns, making ladders and long rods impossible to maneuver up it, and the entrance would prohibit any stick longer than a few feet from going up it.

Missing Quote: Al Mamoun allegedly found Latin inscriptions carved into the roof of the Subterranean Chamber.

linguistics,How does clusivity interact with the royal 'we'?,"This is something I've wondered about occasionally. I'll use examples from Tamil and Malayalam. I am no expert on Tamil, so please correct me if I'm wrong about something.

Classical Tamil had யாம் (yām) as the exclusive first-person plural pronoun and நாம் (nām) as the inclusive one. யாம் was also used for the royal 'we', which does seem to make more sense in a way than using the inclusive.

In modern Malayalam, the exclusive first-person plural is ഞങ്ങൾ (ñaṅṅaḷ) and the usual inclusive one is നമ്മൾ (nammaḷ). The old exclusive form yām isn't used at all, and was probably already lost by the earliest stages of the language. However, the old inclusive nām does survive and is in fact quite common as a slightly more formal or literary alternative to nammaḷ.

Interestingly, in the absence of yām, inclusive nām has also taken taken over the royal 'we' function in Malayalam. My subjective perception is that ñaṅṅaḷ is quite pedestrian and wouldn't have the gravitas required for that sort of thing.

This also works for Nosotros / Nosotras ""Nosotros is ""we"" when there male and females, but nosotras is just for females, and Vosotros / Vosotras for you all, (again depending on gender).  In Chinese, it is the same with 她们 ( tāmen) refering to females, and when there is a mix of genders, you use 他们 ( tāmen ). Even in English, to refer to multiple people I would say ""Hey guys..."" or ""dudes...."". Even when my mom hangs out with her friends, she says ""I'm going to hang out with my girlfriends."" I never heard my father say ""I'm hanging out with my boy friends."" He only refers to them as ""friends"", and sometimes ""the boys"" (My parents are in their 50s, so that is outdated, but still).

'And her loving daughter *name*, who *insert nice thing*...although no-one knows where she got her posh voice from' *que laughter*

So my family are all very old-school, cockney, south Londoners (For non-Brits think like Michael Cain, Barbara Windsor, or the kind of stereotypical accent which is usually used in movies to portray the London working class). And like all true cockneys they are very proud of their cockney heritage and their accent. 

My accent is much closer to 'received pronunciation' (had to look up what it was called as I honestly had no idea), which is the accent considered to be the posh English accent, as it's used mainly within the upper classes. I was born in the same London borough as my entire family, but when I was around 8 we did move slightly further out towards the outskirts, but really not that far (less tha  25 mins) and the regional accent there was not as strong, but still much closer to the south-london accent, rather than RP. And regardless of the move the difference in my accent has been apparent since before then, and has been the case since way before I can remember. I remember being part of a youth drama group before I moved and the other kids used to always say things like 'You have to play the old lady because you're posh' etc.

She was really lovely but started asking me why I chose this borough of London to live in (I moved back to my borough of birth as an adult), and was really amazed to hear it's truly where me and all my family were from. She told me she had assumed I was one of those posh girls who was trying to be hip and 'woke' by choosing to slum it in what's considered a dangerous working class borough whilst having my 'daddy' pay for a flat in a secure building for me. I laughed it off and wasnt offended, as by now I'm used to such assumptions but it has really had me really thinking a lot this past week about why it is that my accent is so different from where i came from and the people around me.

My little divulge into researching how we develop accents didnt really help at all as I couldn't find anything to explain why I would develop a different accent without having any other outside stimuli in the accent I did develop, which I didnt and never have apart from on TV. Would TV really be enough to affect my accent so much? I cannot recall a single show I watched as a child where people spoke a lot in my accent (apart from maybe 'upstairs, downstairs') but I'm sure it must have happened. The only other thing I found was something about people on the Autism spectrum can sometimes develop a completely different accent, but I'm pretty certain that's not the case with me as I do not show any of the other potential symptoms. 

So I guess I'm reaching out for some more expertees advice to maybe explain why or how my accent developed so vastly differently to everyone else.

It's not something that particularly upsets me or anything, but after years of being questioned I guess it's just got me a little intrigued.",1596795975,Alisai23,9

linguistics,"Any semantically inclined, linguistic evolutionists out here?","Consider this - 

The plural of life, ‘lives’, (rhymes with knives) is already problematic enough because of its homographic/heteronymic nature. (Live/life)

Presently, Darwinian linguistics has never (to my knowledge) encountered such an exponential increase in technological advances, international cultural mixing, and evolution in methods of communication on such a ridiculous scale.

How drastically did language evolve during The Renaissance or the American Industrial Revolution? What about in northern Africa during the construction of the pyramids? Or in the America’s before, during, and after the land bridge re-emerged? What vernacular was a direct result of those progresses and changes that later became colloquial, then formally accepted, but it’s origins lost in time? What entire languages were born from such events?

Consider again, ‘lives.’ 
Think - live TV, live action, Instagram/Tiktok live, and more than one life... colloquially, when spoken among my peers, “lives” could refer to the plural of any of these listed... 
When written, LIVEs is sometimes denoted to refer to social media, but, usually the effort isn’t necessary for comprehension. 

Perhaps my observation on the triple (maybe quadruple) homograph/homonym is menial, but it did spark my interest in how all languages of the world are evolving right now, with various, obvious advances and also with regard to the times... and how they must have evolved in the past during significant shifts in geopolitical space... or because of massive growth in population from culture melding... or due to large scale strife or, contrastingly, from a global, universal unity...

Zikril’s last two speakers, Evaristo and Isauro, who are now in their final years, had a quarrel 50 years ago and haven’t spoken to each other since. Martín, a linguist, will undertake the challenge of bringing the two old friends back together and convince them to talk again in order for him to obtain a record of the language.

Many people in the comment section (which are a biased sample given the subreddit) gave one of three solutions or outcomes.

1. Gender is eliminated altogether
2. A Neuter Gender is added
3. One Gender (likely Masculine in Romance Languages) will come to fill the role of a Neuter or Common Gender

Personally I consider the third option the most likely turn of events. One commenter mentioned that Italian speakers refer to Non-Binary Persons using Masculine Agreement.

The first option may be acceptable for French, which, from a non-native perspective, appears to have loose dependence on gender. But this is hard to imagine for a language like Spanish.

The second option also seems dubious, as it appears to need to take mass reforms for most Romance languages (likely reverting back to the original Latin genders). However, I think this is the most demeaning, as it reinforces the idea that grammatical genders are or should be equated with biological sex.

It was once hypothesized that language change occurs most rapidly during times of social upheaval, so the recognition of Non-Binary in the Grammatical Gender may happen more quickly than we imagine.",1596566256,angriguru,19

linguistics,Does/Will widespread literacy and the ubiquity of text “stabilize” a language?,"I’m going to use English as an example, since I think it’s the most prevalent example. A quick Google search reveals that the literacy rate in both the U.S. and the U.K. is about 99%. Books and magazines in English are abundant and very accessible, not to mention the internet, which is overwhelmingly populated by people reading and writing in English (either as natives or as second-language users). 

If you drive down the main roads of any city, you are immersed in text from road signs, billboards, and businesses in amounts which greatly surpass anything you might see even two centuries ago. My point is, 21st century language users (in this case Anglophones) cannot avoid absorbing their language visually. Whether this led to literacy or vice versa, I don’t know.

We know that the rise of the internet naturally produced a great deal of slang, and we recognize that various dialects of English exist—partially due to its status as a lingua franca. But when you take into account the ubiquity of text and the vastly increased ability of people to read that text, is there any evidence that this will stabilize the English language at all? Or is the opposite true?

By “stabilize,” I mean will English see fewer changes in the next, 1000 years than it did in the previous 1000 years? Would English in the year 3000 be mutually intelligible to us now?

linguistics,Maryland Father-Bother merger...Father-Bother merger reversal??,"Hey all,   


I am curious to know more about the father-bother merger, and if it is known if it was never fully completed in certain words on the East Coast, or if it reversing because of the low back merger today.    


I am 22 and from Maryland, and lack the cot-caught merger, with my AW sound being pronounced as ""ɔə"".  I feel like because I am not from New England and have the cot-caught merger I should be father-bother merged...but I don't think I am in all cases.  For the word ""bother"", I believe I use a pronunciation approaching the ""unrounded ""ɒ"""" vowel, and do this in words like ""John"" as well.  I asked my mother who is from the South about this and she also agreed that father and bother do not have exactly the same vowel.  In other words, like ""lot"", I pronounce them like ""aə"" as opposed to a straight up ""a"" in father.  All this said, there are words that I simply pronounce with the ""a"" sound that are part of the lot/bother class.    


I am left very confused by all this.  I know many people in my generation (esp from the midwest where I went to college) are starting to exhibit the cot-caught merger where they merge toward an unrounded ""ɒ"" sound (makes them sound Canadian to me tbh).  Initially I thought that perhaps I am a case of the father-bother merger partially reversing because I have spent so much time around people who pronounce the lot class words as ""ɒ"", while personally I have not merged them with the ""ɔə"" sound because I am from MD .  But I was left confused by the fact that my mom, from the South, also believes father and bother to be pronounced slightly differently.   


Was this merger never fully completed on the East Coast?  Do others from different areas of the East Coast still have words where they use some form of the ""ɒ""/lot vowel even if they do not for all words?  Or is this the case of a reversing merger due to influence from the cot-caught mergering individuals?

They've been in a variety of languages, but I've only noticed this particular behavior in [one film](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8073108/) so far, and it's the first film I've seen in Telugu.

First, I want to be clear I'm not talking about *just* loanwords or small phrases that can be used like particles. Obviously most of the languages on the subcontinent use loanwords due to colonization and cultural interchange. Although on a somewhat note, I did note far more English loanwords in this language than in others.

This is what I'm looking at: A speaker will speak about a paragraph's worth of Telugu, and then summarize their point in English, almost as if certifying the statement as official. So far I've observed a doctor and a police officer do this, which is why I'm making that guess.

Is this the correct interpretation of this practice? Are full English sentences a specific register in Telugu?

Even though I was born and raised in the US, having this slight accent in the way I talk makes me feel like a perpetual foreigner. Basically, I don't feel like I belong here despite me living here my entire life. I've especially noticed this when talking to strangers, where they tend to talk down to me by talking slower and louder, whether it be because of how I look, or because of this accent.

So first question: I know the infinitive can (inflect? Decline?) for tense and voice as in Classical Latin (active vs passive and present, perfect, and future), but can this be done for mood as well? Like, could you have a present Indicative infinitive vs a present subjunctive infinitive. And in a related side-question, does anyone have a good idea of how infinitives come to be? I’ve noticed that, for example in Latin, the perfect and future infinitives, if they are synthetic, tend to seem to be formed from the present infinitive root (stem?) and a suffix sometimes corresponding with one of the regularly inflected tenses (for example the active perfect infinitive of Latin *teneo* is *tenuisse* which is very similar the the pluperfect subjunctive forms which have the base *tenuiss-.* Is this just a coincidence? Or is there some kind of correspondence between these forms and how these tense-inflected infinitives came to be? This is relevant to me because firstly I’m very curious, but I’m also making a conlang which is derived from Latin, but still very synthetic and I want to develop more infinitive stuff but I’m not sure how this kind of thing naturally arises. 

Second question: I was looking on Wiktionary earlier and saw that the conjugation table for a Proto-West-Germanic verb had forms of the infinitive for “genetive-infinitive,” “dative-infinitive,” and “instrumental-infinitive,” and was surprised since I didn’t that that case was something that could apply to a verb form like this (I know participles can have case, but I didn’t know infinitives could). So, how does this work, and can infinitives *actually* decline for case or is this something else described in a misleading way/ that I’m just misunderstanding? I’m just kinda lost on this one.

linguistics,Will rising Australian intonation in speech make people perceive me as being uncertain/weak for jobs in the United States? [Aussie in US],"After listening to a zoom meeting I was in, I was discussing with him briefly how it went and my husband comments that I should try and stop talking like I end my sentences in questions, because it makes me seem like I am uncertain. 

  
I honestly felt a bit hurt and tried to argue that it's because I'm Australian, and we speak with a rising intonation. Like, that's how I talk. And as someone already struggling with identity and trying to keep the ""Aussieness"" in me after recently moving to the US, language is one of the only thing I can try to hold onto, but it sounded like he was literally asking me to change how I speak. 

However I started googling a bit and on Wiki, I came across this statement:

&gt;Media in Australia, Britain, and the United States have negatively portrayed the usage of HRT, claiming that its use exhibits a speaker's insecurities about the statement and undermines effective speaking. Time reports that it hampers job interviews.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Linguist Robin Lakoff drew attention to the pattern in her book *Language and Women's Place*, which argued that women were socialized to talk in ways that lacked power, authority, and confidence.  


And from that I can start to see how it may appear that way for him as quite obviously, this seems to be a real thing. But it makes me both worried and conflicted.

1.  There are so many successful people who speak this way and they sound very certain to me, like new casters and even very charming/impressionable Aussie celebrity interviews on the red carpet.   
\-Is it not the case for everyone else? Does the rest of the world (outside of the UK) also think we sound weird? Because I came across some comments where they couldn't understand Australian newscasters because of the rising intonation.
2. I've been trying to work on my confidence and speaking, and do want to work in HR, but as someone who is already shy and doesn't have the best speaking voice, will this truthfully be another limiting factor?  


I've gone back to school but it frightens me to think this is another thing I have to worry about when I want to get a job. My speaking voice and lack of confidence already stresses me plenty enough.

So if you just take the name Ole and adhere to the definition above there are two distinct vowel sounds [O Le]

2. Does the medium of first experience affect a word's likelihood to enter into passive vocabulary? If I watch a TV show with a new word, is that all that is necessary for me to be able to use it in a sentence later, or do new vocabulary words have to be used in a learning setting with a teacher and corrects before correct usage can happen?

I know that often, adjectives can be noun like or verb like, and that can influence the morphology present on the adjectives. I want to make mine more like nouns, but this creates a problem when it comes to marking gender. My language has three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and gender assignment is mostly semantic, with some semantic residue being sorted into other genders based on ending sounds and morphemes (though the latter of which I still need to fully develop). My problem is that although there is dedicated morphemes for marking the plural in each gender, and these could be used to mark plural masculine or whatever, there isn't really a dedicated singular gender conveying morpheme. What happens in this sort of situations naturally? What can I do to make adjectives agree in gender in a natural way?

linguistics,The Semantics of Gender,"First off, this is clearly a huge topic that encompasses all sorts of fields, from neurology to philosophy to sociology to, my focus here, linguistics. I understand this scope, and therefore want to specifically narrow down my inquiry to the linguistic aspects of it.

I am curious about the semantics of gender. I am not talking about grammatical gender; that is an entirely different subject of its own. I am specifically talking about the socio-linguistic concept of gender. This concept has historically been associated with sex. However, by now, it has been made, scientifically, quite clear that they are different. I don't mean for this to be political; I hope we can all agree that sex is different from gender. My curiosities are with this concept of gender.

Here is a hypothetical: if you are gay, you can be attracted to anyone who experiences gender (identifies) as the same gender as you regardless of what their sex; and, conversely, if you are in a relationship with a cis person who transitions to the opposite gender while still in the relationship, you will probably experience them as that gender and stop having attraction towards them (generally) even though they have the same sex. So, the concept of gender is an empirically real thing that effects our perception of other people.

Gender is clearly different from sex, yet has some connection to it. After all, when trans people experience dysphoria it is because their gender is different from their sex, while cis people do not experience it because they match. As shown in the hypothetical above, gender has no real connection to sex, yet dysphoria is derived from their incongruity.

Now, I have a few questions about the concept of gender.

1. I recognize that people are socialized in a world that heavily emphasizes gender roles, but how did people come to attach these roles to gender, rather than some other aspect of our identity? This may sound like more of a sociology question, but I am interested in the semantic aspect.
2. Is there a linguistic reason we mapped the spectrum of gender onto the spectrum of sex, i.e. why we use the same words (he, she, boy, girl, etc.) to differentiate both sex and gender? Did this stem from a prior belief that they are the same, or did this merging of meaning cause said belief.
3. Semantically, do ""gendered"" words (he, she, boy, girl, etc.) generally refer to gender or sex? What are the trends cross-linguistically? Historically? This is similar to the last one, but I am curious as to which of these two concepts is (usually) referred to by gendered words, now that most languages have merged them semantically?
4. This last question dips a bit into grammatical gender. Is it known why languages with grammatical gender mapped their noun classes onto gender? For example, in IE languages, the classes were originally animate-inanimate. But later, they got mapped onto gender; why did they not map the classes to some other form of natural division?

For now, these are my questions. If I come across any more, I will add an edit section with my new questions. Thanks for your time.",1595992366,yutani333,5

My question is how do certain languages such as Basque or Georgian end up with both a robust polypersonal agreement system and a robust noun case system?

linguistics,Something of a thought experiment - a six-vowel analysis of (my) General American English,"I was looking at some phonetic transcriptions of my own GAE syllable nuclei recently, and had the realisation that 1) an awful lot of them end in glides, and 2) the ones that end in glides mostly look like they're a combination of that glide plus a vowel that appears elsewhere as a monophthong. So I figured I'd experiment with analysing them as vowel+glide sequences, and ended up with an analysis that actually seems to work fairly well.

The set of base vowel phonemes is these six:

&amp;#x200B;

|ɪ|ʊ|
|:-|:-|
|ɛ|ɜ\~ə|
|æ|ɑ|

(You could probably transcribe them with more basic symbols for simplicity's sake, but it doesn't matter that much.)

These combine with the glides /j w/ to produce all of the valid syllable nuclei in (my) GAE (using the typical /b\_t/ frame; parentheses means I had to depart from the frame):

&amp;#x200B;

||base vowel|/\_j/|/\_w/|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ɪ|bit|beat|beaut|
|ʊ|(book)|(Boyd)|boot|
|ɛ|bet|bait|\--|
|ə|but|\--|boat|
|æ|bat|\--|bout|
|ɑ|bot|bite|\--|

It's maybe not 100% satisfying phonetically, but it seems to give a nice clean phonemic analysis. The analysis of *beaut* as /bɪwt/ solves an interesting problem I'd never noticed before thinking about things this way: as far as I can tell, traditional analysis of English allows /CjV/ syllables but there aren't any such syllables where the vowel is something other than /u/. This nicely explains that, and also explains why some consonants seem to appear in a complex onset with /j/ but not with any other approximant (e.g. /v/, where *view* is a perfectly valid word but /vlV/ never appears except in *Vlach* and /vwV vɹV/ only appear in onomatopoeias).

Do people have thoughts on this? Are there any gaping holes in the analysis I've just totally failed to notice?",1595951860,sjiveru,32

linguistics,"""Cancelling"" or suppressing creoles","This post ([link](https://www.facebook.com/brainarchitect/posts/172824647613088)) calling for Singlish to be ""cancelled"" has been making the rounds recently in Singapore. Singlish is a creole spoken in Singapore that's largely based on British English (former British colony) but which has evolved to include vocabulary from many local languages (Mandarin, Malay, Tamil, Hokkien, Teochew, etc.) and distinctive syntax (more 'topic-prominent' like Mandarin or Malay, looser tenses and pluralization where obvious from context). Calls to suppress or reduce the usage of Singlish are not a new thing, and the government has long promoted standard Singapore English (basically RP with some phonetic shifts and looser rules on syllable stress) over Singlish with mixed success. Most people use standard English in formal settings, but Singlish is ubiquitous in informal settings and is used occasionally in more formal speech as well. 

Yet as in the post as well as continued efforts to promote standard English, there's generally a lot of resistance to fully embrace Singlish as a valid language or creole in its own right. Students don't learn Singlish in formal education (they learn English and a mother tongue), but kids obviously pick up Singlish from their parents and daily interactions. No one's calling for formal education in Singlish - it's picked up easily enough, and the importance of English internationally is well-accepted. Most young people are fluent in both English and Singlish, and are mostly able to switch between them depend on the situation, and Singlish use is fairly even across class and race (although the upper class might be less proficient or non-speakers). 

Personally I think it's sad that we continue to uphold the idea that Singlish equals bad English (as is abundantly obvious from the vitriol in the post) or that Singlish is low-class. It's quite ironic to me that the poster goes on and on about Singlish as a reminder of colonialism (""If Singaporean culture can be reduced to a mere performance of our  former inability to master English as a way of differentiating us from  our former colonial masters, this culture is inherently negative."") without realizing how the assumption that Singlish must be judged against British English (or some ""standard English"") is essentially a form of post-colonial hangover. I hate the overuse of colonialism as a justification in all sorts of contexts, but I just can't help but see it here. By setting British English as the ideal, any deviations from it obviously become some form of ""corruption"" or due to a lack of mastery. Learning or speaking Singlish becomes seen as a negative for standard English mastery. No room is left for the possibility that both standard English and Singlish can be recognized as important in their own right as distinct languages with different cultural uses, or that both can be mastered independently.

Are there similar things happening around the world with creoles or local dialects? I know that urbanization and globalization tend to suppress minority languages and dialects due to assimilation into the mainstream/prestige dialect, but the case of Singlish is fairly interesting because Singapore is 100% urban and fairly cosmopolitan, yet Singlish use is almost universal in the population. Despite this, there's still a lot of resistance to 'official' recognition and still (fairly futile, fortunately) attempts to curb its use.",1595936764,quelmotz,52

Over the past few months, i have become a bit obsessed with Phonetics and related topics, including stuff like Phonation, but have never had any formal courses about or other experience with these topics.

I speak English on a relatively High level, but am a native German speaker; whenever i speak English, my pitch sounds noticeably lower than when i speak German, and if i have not fundamentally misunderstood something or misheard my voice, it's mainly a difference in Phonation rather than in pitch.

I've watched some videos in different languages on YouTube, and in most of those Videos, English  sounded like it had a more stiff Phonation than German, while i believe that in Spanish, it's usually a bit more lax.

Are those observations right or just something my brain made up?

What are the difference in languages regarding pitch and Phonation, ignoring those that use Phonation actively for grammar and stuff, like Chinese does with tones? Do they even exist, especially for pitch, or is that speaker-dependant?

Any question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate discussion all of the time, here are some examples: 

*Quick questions:*

* Asking for an explanation of a technical term
* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature
* Asking how we would transcribe something
* Asking how a feature works in a particular language

*Not-so-quick questions:*

* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

linguistics,Japanese Noun Classes and Grammatical Gender,"I have been obsessed with grammatical gender lately; I have been reading a lot about noun classes, and where they come from. This led me to learn about the theory that noun classes arise from noun classifiers. Noun agreement and semantic and phonological deterioration lead to noun classes forming. This, combined with modifier agreement, give rise to differentiation in morphology. Once created, they persist as they provide disambiguation and redundancy of information.

Now for the connection to Japanese. When I learned Japanese counting, I came across their noun classification system. For those who don't know, when you count any noun in Japanese, you have to use its classifier. For example, 1 (bottle of) sake = お酒一本 (sake 1-long-thin-classifier), while 1 house = 家一軒 (house 1-building-classifier). Right now, this is the only morphological realization of such classifications. But, is this an example of how classifiers developed in languages that now have gender? If so, Is it plausible, with the right sound changes and agreement patterns, that this could, hypothetically, evolve into a noun class system? The way I see it, they already mentally categorize nouns, and also use different forms of numbers for each class. All that would be needed is for this to give rise to agreement elsewhere, and with some phonological reduction and reanalysis of classes with case endings (particles), you have a gender/noun class system. Please let me know how far fetched this is. Obviously I know this is unlikely to take place within the next few lifetimes, but is it even plausible?

Additionally, are there any languages currently that are in the process of creating noun classes/gender systems? If so, I would appreciate it if you could let me know, possibly with examples.

linguistics,Infinitives Across Languages,"Pretty much what it says on the tin. I'm a linguistics enthusiast, but also can speak (and am learning) multiple languages, and am curious about infinitives. One thing I have noticed is the peculiarity of the infinitive. By definition, it is a form of a verb that isn't ""finite."" or bound to a tense or person (or other argument). It is easy to find the infinitives in many Indo-European languages, as they are a very distinct form, and are the ""dictionary"" forms. *Parler* in French, *hablar* in Spanish, *to speak* in English. However, in other languages, it is not so simple. In Japanese, for example, the ""dictionary"" form is simply the informal non-past form of the verbː 話す = (subject) speak(s). To make it truly non-finite, you could make it the gerund form: 話すの = (the act of) speaking. As for Tamil, I haven't looked into dictionaries, but from what my mom tells me, the ""dictionary"" form is simply the gerund form: pesardu = (the act of) speaking.

So, this leads to my questions.

1. In the IE languages I have studied, the infinitive is pretty a easily demarcated form of the word. You learn the infinitive, from which you conjugate. And the infinitive has certain specific uses. How common is this type of infinitive cross-linguistically?
2. How does the infinitive form evolve? In most IE languages, it is a single word which is modified in its finite forms. In English, the infinitive is 2 words: to +  verb. How did this come about, and how common is this type of infinitive cross-linguistically? (I started thinking about this when I found out about the rule to not split infinitives in English)
3. As I mentioned above, not all languages have a clearly demarcated infinitive form. Perhaps my understanding of infinitives is a bit off, but I was wondering why the languages with specific infinitives evolved those, instead of simply using the gerund form (which most of them have as well).
4. I haven't studied many isolating languages, so I am a bit unsure as to how they treat the concept of the infinitive. I have a decent idea of how they express person, tense, aspect, etc. through markers or extra words. So, do they have this distinction between the gerund and infinitive? Or do they simply use the root of the verb for both?

I have been learning languages for the last few years, and i do focus on pronunciation and accents  a lot, so i have some knowledge when it comes to IPA and the way different sounds are produced and what they are called, but i don't know all of the terminology of course, so im sorry if some things here are hard to understand.

Recently, however, i noticed a weird thing in my native accent. I am German, living in Bavaria, with a light Southern German Accent that is definitely still Standard High German rather than some more distinct dialect.

In syllables that normally consist of p/t/k+(schwa, but i don't pronounce that)+n, i replace the voiceless consonant with a glottal stop(and the n with a ng or m if the replaced sound was a k or p).
If the first consonant is a voiceless b/d/g instead, i do something similar without a glottal stop.
 
For d, i just pronounce an n, but flap my tongue harder against the roof of my mouth, a bit like an alveolar tap.

For b and g, i also replace the n with a more forceful version of m/ng like before, but in addition to that, i also do something weird that feels like a glottal stop, but with the airway of the nose instead of the mouth. It only works with my tongue in velar position.

Sorry if this is a bit unclear, does anyone have an idea what i am talking about, and what that thing is? I am happy to give more information, i just don't know what else could be of importance here.

linguistics,"Is there a field that attempts to examine what makes a language ""effective"" or otherwise ""good""?","I remember a conversation about how third-person pronouns can be confusing when there are multiple third persons. For instance, ""John hit James in the head after James insulted John"" can be written as ""He hit him in the head after he insulted him"".

I forgot what language it was but there is a language that avoids this problem by assigning two different pronouns for the same gender, e.g. He/him1 and He/him2. Context would then make it identifiable which person is 1 and which person is 2. So the sentence could be rewritten as He1 hit him2 in the head after he2 insulted him1.

My question here, then, is: what is the lexical breakdown of this posited \**uwáy* that would mean ""to see oneself?"" Is it a middle-voice / reflexive form of a verb meaning to see? What PIE verb/root might that be? As far as I know, the main roots for ""to see"" in PIE were \*h₃ekʷ-, weyd-, \*kʷeḱ-, and \*sekʷ- (though this last one was more properly ""to follow"" i.e. with the eyes).",1595338630,pstamato,6
linguistics,Proto-Japonic “Doubling Game”?,"The Proto-Japonic numeral system is (omitting asterisks for brevity):

* 1 pitə
* 2 puta
* 3 mi
* 4 jə
* 5 itu
* 6 mu
* 7 nana
* 8 ja
* 9 kəkənə
* 10 təwə
* 20 pata

As has been noted for I-don’t-know-how-long, there appears to be a “doubling game” in which /i/ &amp; /ə/ become /u/ &amp; /a/: *1 pitə &gt; 2 puta, 3 mi &gt; 6 mu, 4 jə &gt; 8 ja*... And then suddenly, it ends. The two options, of course, are either (A) it’s a coincidence or (B) it’s not.

Worth noting is that Japonic has only the most minor of vowel harmonies—called “Arisaka’s Law”—which (empirically) requires that \*ə never be in the same root as \*a, \*o, or \*u (the non-front vowels). It doesn’t apply across morpheme boundaries, or in the extremely rare cases where it does, usually it just makes \*ə &gt; \*a. (Japonic also seems to have never had morphological singular or plural for nouns, FWIW.)

So, given all that, I have two questions regarding this:

* **Can anyone point me to literature discussing how this may have arisen in Japonic, even briefly?** Ideally unrelated to Altaic or Koreo-Japonic or other external comparisons. (Searching for “Japonic Numbers” etc. doesn’t get me much, sadly.) Or, if any linguists feel like chiming in with some speculation, please do.
* **Are there number systems in other language families that follow similar “doubling games,” and how did they arise?**",1595327749,matt_aegrin,10
linguistics,Are there any cognitive benefits to specific word orders?,"Hi,

I'm part of a team of conlangers working on [building a language](https://www.reddit.com/r/EncapsulatedLanguage/) democratically.

# The problem

We're trying to decide on a word order and need some help.

The goal of our language project is to create a language that encapsulates as much mathematical and scientific information along with other things. What we're struggling with right now is trying to find out if there has been any scientific literature written on the cognitive benefits of different word orders (if it exists). Basically, we want to know if there's any scientific literature in this regard that shows whether a particular word order helps a speakers in any way (i.e. short term memory etc)

Our weekly Q&amp;A thread is the perfect place to post them! A new Q&amp;A thread goes up every Monday, but we have people who read them regularly throughout the week.

**What counts as a “quick question”?**

Any question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate discussion all of the time, here are some examples: 

*Quick questions:*

* Asking for an explanation of a technical term
* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature
* Asking how we would transcribe something
* Asking how a feature works in a particular language

*Not-so-quick questions:*

* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

Also, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first.

linguistics,Do the numerals in Finnish indicate an earlier octal (base-8) number system?,"Forgive me if this seems an ignorant question, but I couldn’t find anything remotely related to this online.

In Finnish, the numerals 1-7 seem to have relatively meaningless names (“meaningless” meaning their phonetic value doesn’t mean anything more than the number itself). However, eight (kahdeksan) and nine (yhdeksän) seem to have the declined forms of one (yksi —&gt; yhde-) and two (kaksi —&gt; kahde-) built into them, as if two say that 8 is “two (less than ten)” and 9 is “one (less than ten).” 

Does this imply that, at some point in the distant past, Finnish either made the switch from an octal numbering system to the decimal system or that Finns adapted their counting system when speaking with users of the decimal system in a way that eventually got cemented into common use? Or am I totally off base with this question?

linguistics,Unacceptable vs. Ungrammatical,"I’ve been doing some reading in prep for grad school and I came across the notion of acceptability and grammaticality, which I’m guessing is specific to syntax? Never heard of it elsewhere. 

Haegeman (1991: 8) says the following: “The native speaker who judges a sentence cannot decide whether it is grammatical. He only has intuitions about acceptability. It is for the linguist to determine whether the unacceptability of a sentence is due to grammatical principles or whether it may be due to other factors.”

Examples given of other factors are “more general mechanisms used for processing information”

This looks to me (a phonologist) like a lazy way to cover up mispredictions. If a theory of syntax predicts that a sentence is grammatical, but it is deemed unacceptable by a native speaker, you could just say the sentence is unacceptable because X, but it is grammatical. Is the distinction between unacceptable and ungrammatical taken seriously? Allowing such a thing enables me to say ‘Homework dog my ate the’ is grammatical but unacceptable because it’s difficult to process, so my theory of syntax doesn’t have to account for it. Do people actually do that with cases that are a less flagrant violation of scientific integrity?

One English example that comes to mind where this seems like it might be valid is: *Sally picked up it. While it’s syntactically well-formed it can be ruled out phonologically, thus is still *ungrammatical* but not in the syntax. Other than sentences of this sort, is there evidence of specific cases where a clearly grammatical sentence is judged as unacceptable for some other reason (not semantically anomalous sentences like ‘#Colorless green ideas sleep furiously’ or ‘#The book danced’)?

I’m in the US if that’s at all relevant. I know things can differ quite drastically depending on region, though that variation is less prominent in syntax than phonology",1595230751,LoSchifoso,67

Did the Chinese never classify their own many dialects? Did the Mughal empire never attempt to analyse the languages of the indian continent which they had just conquered? Did the Russian empire never attempt to classify the languages of Eastern Europe where many ethnicities came under their rule?

I'm not a linguist.  I have enough German, Spanish, Russian, and Arabic to get myself into trouble, but basically I'm a typical American one-language native English speaker (Mid-Atlantic).  Lately I have wondered, given that presumably all humans are capable (barring specific individual disabilities) of the same suite of sounds, why do some languages seem to not use sounds that humans can make without much effort.  For example: in Arabic, there's no V sound.  Meanwhile Arabic leans heavily on what I think are called stops and fricatives, what an English-speaker might think of as guttural sounds, K and Kh and Q and H-with-a-dot and the like, while English really only uses H and K (and occasionally a borrowed Kh, always shown in encyclopedia entries as ""like the ch in 'loch'"" as if that was a common word).  These sounds aren't actually difficult to produce, so why aren't they more common outside of Semitic languages?  Then, too, there are the click languages of subsaharan Africa, which use sounds almost no other languages use at all but most humans can make instinctively.  I mean, I know Hawai'ian only uses about 8 consonants (and maybe the glottal stop if that's not a consonant).  Surely that's not because of some physical difference in the Polynesian palate.

Anyway.  I just wonder if there's any explanation (that isn't just post-hoc speculation) for why and how the speakers of languages came to settle on the particular suite of sounds they use, and why that suite differs so much from language to language around the world.",1595020093,thehappysmith,2

Anyway, I'm currently trying to measure the amplitude of the second harmonic (often abbreviated as A2) in a Praat script. The one I have as an example currently measures A1 and A3 but leaves out A2 for some reason. It measures them with the following code:

`a1 = (energy2 + energy3) / 2`

`a3 = (energy11 + energy12 + energy13) / 3`

Energy seems to refer to the LTAS of the recording, split into 15 bands, so energy2 + energy3 is the amplitude of 500Hz and 750Hz and energy11-13 refers to the amplitude of 2750-3250Hz. So is it fair to assume that A2 should have the following code?

`a2 = (energy4 + energy5 + energy6 + energy7 + energy8 + energy9 + energy10) / 7`

So the average dB of 1000-2500Hz? Seems like a lot of energy space for one harmonic...",1594976019,Zetland,6
linguistics,"With all the laws, why are quebecois people still so scared of English?","I can see a general fear of being overwhelmed by English which has much more influence, but there are laws (that sometimes maybe go a bit far) specifically meant to protect the language, and I still interact with people who are quite anti-English. Things like saying “hi bonjour” instead of “bonjour hi” have gotten cashiers yelled at, and some anglophones and other immigrants in Montreal feel excluded. 

There are more allophones in Québec than anglophones, and there are four different regions where English speakers make up less than 5% of the population (Québec City, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, and Trois-Rivières) and native French speakers make up 90% of the population. Data I’ve also seen shows that 70% of immigrants are choosing to go to universities with French instruction even after it’s no longer required. The only thing I can see is threatening québécois is a low birth-rate, but Law 101 more than makes up for that with schooling regulations for immigrants. 

If I’m misinterpreting the data please let me know, but I guess I’m mostly wondering: with so many protections in place that seem to have worked wonders, why is there still so much resentment/fear of English in Québec? It really doesn’t seem like any time in the near future French speakers will just stop passing their language down, but so many still are staunchly against English phrases even entering. 

I’d love to hear any linguistic perspective! :)",1594973057,notevenfrenchh,14

I was reading a little on Wikipedia about the ICAO/NATO alphabet (Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, etc.).

linguistics,Theoretical Syntax: Question on HDPSGs and crossing-dependencies,"So I've never studied head-driven phrase structure grammars, but I learned about the basics in a P&amp;P syntax course I took. If anyone has any experience working in them or otherwise knows a lot about it, I was wondering how a typical non-movement grammar might account for the crossing-dependency effects we see in languages like Dutch. Consider the following examples:

&amp;#x200B;

    1) Het is koud.
        it is cold
    
    2) Ik ga binnen.
        I go inside
    
    3) Ik ga binnen, want het koud is.
        I go inside  bc   it  cold is
        ""I'm going inside cause it's cold.""


In P&amp;P, or any other transformational grammar with movement, we'd say that there's a mandatory V to T to C movement which accounts for the basic word order in (1) and (2), with the subject *ik* or *het* moving to Spec of CP as some sort of topic requirement. Thus, when C head is already occupied, as in the embedded clause of (3), no T to C movement occurs and therefore no topic movement does either, resulting in the predicate *is* and the subject *het* both remaining *in-situ*. How would a HDPSG go about parsing this, and where can I learn more about modern solutions? Would complementizers like *want*  subcategorize for a new phrase type? Would there be another lexical entry for all embedded predicates that have right-hand complements instead of left?",1594940740,SankingDragon,1

linguistics,How will the global demographic shift affect the world's most spoken languages?,"A recently released study by American researchers has found that global fertility rates are plummeting, amd that by 2100 nearly every country's population will be declining.

However, this shift will be more pronounced in certain countries than others, as some countries have already started declining in population, while others are only expected to peak much later in the century, with a few, primarily developing nations, still expected to be growing, albeit much more slowly than today, even after 2100.

To highlight just how massive this demographic shift will be, consider that the population of Italy is expected to halve by 2100, while the population of sub-Saharan Africa will be triple what it is today.

Given that many countries in Africa use either English or French as an official language, it can thus be easily deduced that the proportion of these languages' speakers that is of African origin will increase dramatically. Conversely, the percentage of speakers from ""traditional"" English (U.K., U.S.), and French (France, Québec, Belgium) speaking areas will greatly decline. Additionally, this process will be further accelerated by the meteoric growth of English and French in Africa, where currently large pockets of the population still do not speak these languages, but are quickly learning them, due to the urbanization and the fact that most schooling and business is usually conducted in the country's official language (i.e. French or English). Additionally, both English and French have a widespread Internet presence, but many native African languages are almost completely absent online. Furthermore, with increasing globalization, immigration and international travel are expected to increase as well.

With this in mind, are we due for a revolution in the way English, French and perhaps other European languages are spoken? Although many people in the developing world will learn these languages, they will also not forget their native language (and rightfully so), and as such the other languages they speak will influence the way they speak their second language. Therefore, their native sentence structure, grammar, and accent, among other things, will influence the use of their new language and since the demographic shift will mean they now constitute a much larger piece of the proverbial pie in terms of the proportion of language speakers, it stands to reason that their dialects may become more prominent and may filter into the standard vernacular. In short, can we expect a future where many of the world's languages undergo a seismic shift due to growing influence from the developing world? Will ""Africanisms"" from various African languages be as common in English as Anglicisms in other languages today? Will the language spoken in 50 years be filled with new words and expressions derived from African languages that will make large parts of it incomprehensible to people today? And lastly, how will the average person react to these changes? Will they incorporate them into their everyday language and embrace them, or will racists, prescriptivists, and language purists make every effort to resist the changes, potentially causing the language to split into new dialects?",1594934142,shydude92,7

linguistics,The case for the free usage of the term “spirit animal”," Recently the term spirit animal has come under some scrutiny for being a vehicle for the cultural appropriation of native american culture and practices.  

But is the criticism founded on true merit? Or have the communities, that criticise the term being used freely, ignored the global history of the practice and  the vastness of it’s cultural usage?

Etymologically both words appear in the 13th and 14th century

Spirit coming from the latin *spirare* meaning breath

[https://www.etymonline.com/word/spirit](https://www.etymonline.com/word/spirit)

and animal coming from a similar root in latin of breath or *anima*

*animalis* meaning to have breath.

[https://www.etymonline.com/word/animal](https://www.etymonline.com/word/animal)

Animism or the idea of a soul existing all things living are connections humans have made in their spiritual journeys around the world in various different cultures.

“Examples of animistic cultures include the Q’ero of Peru and Bolivia, the tribes of North America, the Mayan people of Central America, the Maori of New Zealand, the Aborigines of Australia, tribal groups of Africa, the ancient Celts and Vikings…”[http://www.sacredhoop.org/Free-Guide-To-Shamanism/Sacred-Hoop-Free-Guide-To-Shamanism.pdf](http://www.sacredhoop.org/Free-Guide-To-Shamanism/Sacred-Hoop-Free-Guide-To-Shamanism.pdf)

Through those ideas everything becomes living, even ideas gain anima if a spiritual presence or energy can be connected to it and experienced.  

The term power animal and spirit helper are used ritually by animistic communities as valid entities in the search of gaining strength through visions or consciousness.  

The terms spirit helper and power animal are what is commonly misrepresented as the idea of the spirit animal and the two get mixed up in common conversation. But spirit animal as a whole other term has existed and it’s ideas have taken a new shape for many centuries and can be seen in written documents such as the chinese imperial thesaurus The Peiwen Yunfu translated by w.h. medhurst.

[https://books.google.is/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=AVMEAAAAQAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22spirit+animal%22&amp;ots=vLh1x7QMVw&amp;sig=6ao8UNN32JNEHNmml22AEccZlcw&amp;redir\_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false](https://books.google.is/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=AVMEAAAAQAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22spirit+animal%22&amp;ots=vLh1x7QMVw&amp;sig=6ao8UNN32JNEHNmml22AEccZlcw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)

The spirit animal is also mentioned in the Markhams master piece containing all knowledge belongin to the smith, farrier or Horse-Leach, touching the curing all diseaes in horses. There it is used to seperate the aspects of the life of the horse into the concepts of the *Spirit Vital* and the *Spirit Animal*

In regards to modern shamanistic representations of the power animal or helping spirit in ritual practices. They have been known to have therapeutic effects on people aiming to retrieve a state lost by trauma and other mental state changes. [https://kockuvonstuckrad.com/downloads/download02.pdf](https://kockuvonstuckrad.com/downloads/download02.pdf)

Concurrently the term spirit animal is used as a symbol of empowerment for people who seek strength in the living forces of nature and the metaphorical symbols they represent. It is a highly romanticised ideal that is not in direct relation to the practices of a specific religious or spiritual practices of certain tribes but more in line with the poetic approach to symbolism.

——

So in conclusion the term spirit animal has various roots in many cultural spheres. Has been used for describing the essence of the animal itself, is known as term for the connection of the spirit of the animal to a human and this common practice has widespread cultural connotations throughout the globe.  

The origins of the word have a deep connection to the essence of life from it’s latin roots. Breath and living and feeling reinvigorated through the ideal of finding a connection to an animal is a beneficial and therapeutic with it's approach to animistic principles. And does not seem to have linguistic usage in ritual practices as to confuse the issue and the terms that are generally used for ritual purposes are spirit guides and power animals.  

Hence spirit animal is a word the general populous has chosen as it’s vessel for appreciation of the various animalistic connotations their own human psyche can obtain, and is a symbol of affection and connection in the active spiritual roleplay of an individuals daily life.",1594910478,sleepingonabeach,0

linguistics,"Looking at the Avestan language, why is it so weird/irregular/unpredictable? It is due to poor manuscript transmission, or extreme lack of morphological leveling?","Despite being the sister language to Sanskrit, it is near impossible to predict the Avestan form with the Sanskrit form. Why does -ŋh- appear sometimes instead of -h-? For example, based on Sanskrit svasar, one would expect \*hwahar, but xᵛaŋhar appears instead. Also why is there multiple h-like sounds (transcribed h, *x́, x)*, despite coming from the same proto Iranian phoneme? Why is \[w\~v\] sometimes spelt &lt;v&gt; and othertimes &lt;uu&gt;?

[This wiktionary article is the most extreme case I've seen](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h₁óh₃s).

linguistics,Turkish: seemingly non-perfective usage of the -DI past,"Grammar books (e.g. Göksel and Kerslake) analyze the -DI past tense as a perfective aspect form and seem to ignore cases where its aspectual value looks rather imperfective. Being a native speaker of a language (Russian) with a really strict distinction between the aspects, I always stumble over such sentences.

I [tried to ask](https://www.reddit.com/r/turkishlearning/comments/hqwpo2/perfective_past_tense_hep/) about this in /r/turkishlearning, but probably this topic is too advanced for that sub. The folks there, native speakers, confirmed that sentences like *Ali hep kitap aldı.* and *Seni hep sevdim.* are grammatical, but the aspect of the verbs in these sentences is still a mystery to me. Is it indeed perfective? If not, why isn't -Iyordu used instead of -DI, or in other words, what are the rules for expressing imperfective aspect with -DI?

What makes me think the aspect is imperfective is mostly an analogy with Russian. If I were to translate those sentences to Russian, I'd have to use imperfective verbs. But can it be that my idea of aspects is distorted by how they work in Russian? What can I be missing? I don't want to think that Göksel and Kerslake can be wrong.",1594743744,thorn0,4

linguistics,Double negatives in English,"Here's a sentence: ""It is not without extreme sadness that your job application has been denied.""

There are two negatives in that sentence. Most of the time when double negatives happen in English, it's either to signify a positive or to avoid absolute language(Example:""I'm not not paying attention"" means there is some attention but not complete attention being paid). But most of the time, the sentence makes meaningful sense without one of the negatives.

But in the first sentence that I mentioned, if one of the negatives: the word ""not"", is removed, then there isn't any meaning. We get: ""It is without extreme sadness that your job application has been denied"". ""Without extreme sadness"" says nothing about how the sadness relates to the situation. It carries just as much meaning as ""Your job application has been denied"".

linguistics,The wiring in my brain - is it too late for me?,"Quick (I hope) background: mother from a Nordic country, father is English-speaker, I grew up in different countries abroad, almost always visiting “home” Nordic country each summer, lived in “home” Nordic country from ages 12-15 (but went to an English-speaking school, spoke exclusively in English with all family, friends and acquaintances, many who would respond in Nordic language), since age 18 have lived in English-speaking countries, while visiting “home” Nordic country every two years or so. I always continued speaking English when visiting, due to laziness, embarrassment, shame, and also - that was the person who my friends and family had come to know.

Today: I am in my early 30s, living in the “home” Nordic country, and desperately wish to (re)learn the language. There is a lot of psychological baggage around it for me (deeply emotional concepts such as identity, belonging, acceptance, community, etc. etc.), so I do struggle quite a bit. 

I have a great passive fluency - I understand everything, even regional dialects (though sometimes of course with philosophical or political discussions, there will be unfamiliar words every now and again), I can read very well, I do struggle with writing but this is less urgent.

The problem, as always, is with speaking. I have an obvious “foreign” accent (which is fine, I would just like to build up the speaking fluency), I struggle to get the correct pronunciation out quite often, I lack vocabulary and often struggle to find (even simple) words, and I struggle with grammar (e.g. verb conjugation, remembering what gender nouns are). 

What also happens is that when I try to speak, especially with those who know me, my mind goes blank, I freeze up, I panic. In addition, because I’d been exposed to many different regional dialects - when I try to speak, my mind kind of panics unsure as to which word from which dialect to choose from.

There are a good few things I am doing to improve on this! Throwing myself out there speaking with strangers, reading, listening, watching as much of the Nordic language as I can (though, again, speaking is the issue), I am looking for a language tandem buddy at the minute, and I am also working on my mental health issues around this, doing self-care type stuff.

Any other advice is \*greatly\* welcome.

However, I have a specific question: 

Based on all that is written above, is it too late for me? 

And have you heard of anything like this before?

I’m worried that the so-called wiring in my brain has reached a permanent stage, and that I will never reach a level where speaking comes easier to me.

This is a great fear of mine. Any advice would be much appreciated.",1594667397,After_Understanding5,5

Any question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate discussion all of the time, here are some examples: 

*Quick questions:*

* Asking for an explanation of a technical term
* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature
* Asking how we would transcribe something
* Asking how a feature works in a particular language

*Not-so-quick questions:*

* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

linguistics,Does understanding an already known foreign language become more difficult with age-related hearing loss? [QUESTION],"So at the moment I am working with survey data of about 8,000 people aged 55 and over who talk about their experiences speaking one or more languages. One of the questions simply asks them if they have any remarks. Quite a large number of people state that they rarely use a foreign language or second language anymore  because of hearing loss. 

Is this typical? On the one hand I can imagine that with hearing loss also comes reduced capability to distinguish sounds that are less familiar / less practiced. At the same time, one would think that if you're proficient in a second language that you retain the ability to understand it to a working degree.

Does anyone know about this / have sources on this? I'd be very interested in learning more about why this is the case",1594629449,mannulusmeum,5

linguistics,Is 'valid' the new 'literally'?,"Apologies if this is not the right place for this kind of question, but lately I've noticed a lot of people using the word 'valid' in ways that seem new.

Prior to a few months ago, I'd almost only ever heard the word used to describe things that conform to a set of well-defined rules, like a valid move in a game, or a valid argument (i.e. one that conforms to the rules of logic). In other words, something was valid if it was objectively correct or appropriate. I'd heard ""your feelings are valid"" once or twice, but it always struck me as a hyperbolic usage of the term, as if the speaker were saying ""your feelings are not merely justified/normal/understandable, they are, in fact, objectively correct."" It reminds me of the way people use the word 'literally' for emphasis, borrowing the weight of the term to make a statement more forceful.

And maybe this is just a Baader-Meinhof thing, but lately, I've noticed a lot more people using 'valid' in this emphatic way. Of particular note is the slogan ""trans people are valid."" While I agree with the sentiment being expressed, as an English sentence it grates on my ears. Am I way off base here? Is this usage new, or am I just now noticing it?

Also, how common is it for people to borrow stronger words for emphasis, causing a gradual shift in the definition? Are there any other examples, besides the 'literally' and the euphemism treadmill?",1594611472,pseudoLit,3

becomes

""I'm going to Aldis"".

This reminds me of the north germanic genitive case, especially in that the preposition ""to"" was also genitive in these languages.

When I was in school, we would read and translate texts from the classical period (ancient attic Greek and Classical Latin).

That however makes me wonder where this type of modelling (?) stems from. In syntax in linguistics I've seen that we don't care that much for semantical interpretations of grammatical structures but mostly how words are binding together to make constituents.

**Method:**
The current prototype has been created using python.

*Step 1:*
All possible syllables were generated using a simple set of rules derived from [Wikipedia's list English of phonotactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonotactics#English_phonotactics). 

*Step 2:*
A list of how frequently English words are used was created by downloading a large dataset of text from the internet and parsing it to detect how often they occur.

*Step 3:*
Finally the list of syllables are sorted based on length and assigned to an English word based on their frequency. ""the"" is for instance assigned as ""a"" while less common words get assigned longer syllables, such as with ""smalltimers"" which is assigned as ""grojm"".

**Future Work:**
* The current implementation of syllable generation is somewhat crude, using letters rather than pronunciation and not implementing all of the phonotactic rules. Ideally each generated word should feel natural to pronounce to any English speaker, which is not the case at the moment.

* The dataset used consists of about 500 MB of what mostly looks to be text dumps from work emails. This introduces some unfortunate artifacts to the system. For instance the word ""xfilename"" is currently among the top 20 most common words. Later iterations should look for a more suitable dataset.

* The system does not take into account grammatical factors such as conjugation. ""run"" and ""running"" for instance get assigned to completely different words. The same applies to numbers. Later iterations might introduce some simple grammatical rules which builds on the language's original premise. 

**Conclusion:**
This post was written primarily to gauge how interesting people find the idea presented. While this language is far from being in a state which I am happy with, there is little reason to continue the project if something similar has been done before or if the idea feels banal. Any user input would be greatly appreciated.

Addendum if the project should continue:
Do any of you have a suggestion regarding how grammar rules such as conjugation could be handled in the most concise way possible?",1594385785,FrostTactics,10

linguistics,"Linguistically speaking, what does the English 'his' and stuff do in this given context?","Sentence like 'He looked back over his shoulder and doffed his scarf his mum knitted for him.' or

'I shut my laptop down and looked outside my room seeing my kids playing in my yard.'

When translating these English sentences to a language that doesn't use pronouns this often, they can very often be troublesome. If you put these sentences straight into mandarin you'll get something like “他回他的头，脱下了他的他妈妈织给他的围巾。” “我关上我的笔记本电脑，从我的房间里看向外面，看到我的孩子在我的院子里玩耍。” They sound awfully weird.

I believe these pronouns, as in 'his scarf', 'my yard', function just as the normal 'the'. And above that, they deliver the slight hint hint that 'these things belong to someone'.

If you replace most of these pronouns with 'the', those sentences still make perfect sense.

So I'm here asking you all, linguistically speaking, what does these pronouns do when they can actually be replaced by a 'the' as I can confidently drop them out when translating next time.",1594364395,MasThomp007,7

linguistics,"What would the English word for ""bear"" be if it had preserved the original Proto-Indo-European root?","As many here probably know, the English word ""bear"" comes from the same root word as the word ""brown"", alluding to the color of the animal. This slang term completely replaced the original Proto-Indo-European word for bear, ""*h₂r̥tḱós"", apparently because of a taboo whereby it was believed that saying the true name of the bear would summon one. This belief was also held by Slavic language speakers, which call it ""medved"", literally ""honey-eater"", but *not* by speakers of Italic languages - the original PIE word continued to be used, developing into the Latin ""ursus"" and subsequently into modern Romance derivatives such as the French ""ours"". 

In light of this, what if, in an alternate universe, Germanic speakers never developed this taboo surrounding bears? Using rules of Germanic sound changes, what would the modern English word for ""bear"" be if it had derived from the Proto-Indo-European root word?",1594268416,passengerpigeon20,127

linguistics,Extreme lowering of Spanish /o/ near Chicago?,"I live in the Indiana part of the Chicago Metropolitan Area.

At my usual Mexican take-out place, whenever I’ve heard the cashier (a native Spanish speaker) pronounce the surname “Lopez,” she does so with a VERY lowered /o/. It sounds so much like “Lapes” to my anglophone ear that I’m tempted to transcribe the /o/ as an [ɑ] here. I haven’t heard her speak Spanish enough for me to observe how she pronounces her /o/ in other environments.

I checked the Wikipedia article on Spanish phonology for allophones of /o/, and although I saw an allophonic lowering of /o/ to [ɔ], the /o/ in “Lopez” didn’t seem to me to occur within any of the environments in which the article says this allophony can take place.

So, I ask, is there any widespread precedence for this lowering? Or is it idiolectal? Or am I simply mishearing her /o/, or misattributing lowering to what’s really a loss of rounding or something?",1594242295,Stuff_Nugget,7

linguistics,How did personal endings arise?,"I understand how inflection arises, in general. There is usually first an adposition that loses lexical meaning and (sometimes) phonologically deteriorates until it is simply an inflection of the word it is attached to. This is how, for example, noun cases can arise, like the dative from the word ""to.""

My question now is how this process worked for personal endings on verbs. As I understand it, tense, aspect, and mood would have been denoted by markers, which subsequently become grammaticalized into endings. I can understand that process. But, if you use the personal pronouns (or names) with verbs, how do they then gain the redundancy of inflection for person on the verb. I get why it would remain once innovated for, but how did the innovation arise in the first place?

To be clear, this is not a prescriptivist question of ""why this useless feature is in the language,"" but a descriptivist inquiry into how this feature developed.

P.S. if anyone can answer this same question for gender conjugation (in Indic languages), or grammatical gender in general, I would appreciate it as well.",1594221700,yutani333,22

linguistics,"What is this rising-falling intonation pattern in English, as spoken in Seinfeld?","In the American sitcom series *Seinfeld* (1989 – 1998), the actors use a rising-falling intonation pattern, usually at the ends of questions or exclamations. The rise and the fall can both take one or more syllables. Here are some examples:

* ""[Again with the sweatpants](https://youtu.be/-0Hbu4Z4pGI?t=3)"": rising across all syllables except the last, which is falling
* ""[Not allowed to have people over](https://youtu.be/vQofPLIPo2Y?t=17)"": rising across ""people,"" falling across ""over""
* ""[It's a natural](https://youtu.be/vQofPLIPo2Y?t=111)"": rising on /næ/, falling on /tʃɹəl/

linguistics,How well can the formulation of utterances be analyzed?,"Is it possible to have such a detailed grammar of a language that we could list up all the rules that were applied in the selection of each utterance, in a conversation?

It seems like this would need to start with a “functional” view, that is to say, considering what the speaker needed to express, such as, “soliciting information from the other person in the conversation”, or, “greeting them”, or something.

Sometimes this would translate to arbitrary conventions, like, in this language, “X” is a common greeting.

But more often it would be a series of rules we apply, like: She wants to ask him where he put the keys. The utterance comes from first the declarative form of the sentence, The keys are (location). Then it is converted into question form by a certain rule, put the question word “where” at the beginning, then the verb, then the subject of the sentence “the keys”, and so on.

Sorry to be a bit vague here but the idea is that we could fully analyze “Why” for every utterance we encounter, for every word and grammatical choice. How near are we to being able to do this? In what ways?

linguistics,[Syntax] I've proved that a certain syntax tree yields an ungrammatical English sentence. Where does my proof fail?,"Working within the Minimalist framework, I'll argue that the sentence represented by [this](https://imgur.com/TIS5ysL) syntax tree is unacceptable in English. Please let me know if my proof is solid, and if not, why.

The proof will make use of the following assumptions about the structure of syntax objects in the Minimalist framework. If one of these assumptions is incorrect, please let me know.

**Assumptions**

1. A syntax object is either a lexical item or a set consisting of two distinct syntax objects, called its *daughters*. We shall call a syntax object of the first kind *atomic* and a syntax object of the second kind *branching*.
2. A syntax object can't be simultaneously atomic and branching.
3. Every syntax object has a, possibly empty, label.
4. The label of a branching syntax object *s* equals the label of exactly one of its daughters. This daughter is called the *head* of *s*. 
5. Let *s* = {*h*, *d*} be a syntax object with daughters *h* and *d*, and suppose that *h* is the head of *s*. If *h* is atomic, *d* is called the *complement* of *s*; otherwise, *d* is called the *specifier* of *s*.
6. In the linearisation of an English-language syntax object *s*, the linearisation of the specifier of *s*, if any, precedes that of the head of *s*, which precedes that of the complement of *s*, if any.

**To prove**: The phonological linearisation of the syntax object represented by [this](https://imgur.com/TIS5ysL) syntax diagram is an unacceptable in English.

**Proof**:

Call the given syntax object *s*. By assumption 4 the head of *s* is its C-daughter. By assumption 1 this daughter is branching. Therefore, by assumption 5, the TP-daughter of *s* is its specifier. Therefore, by assumption 6, in the linearisation of *s*, the linearisation of the TP-daughter precedes that of the C-daughter. Applying similar reasoning recursively, and noting that according to the tree diagram the ""should"" contained in the TP-constituent is silent, it follows that the linearisation of *s* is: ""they have called the police should"", which is an unacceptable English sentence. **QED**",1594107362,dodli,22

linguistics,How do linguists make language trees?,"Hello,

I'm a biologist who's interested in languages. I have come across the concept of language trees and while the main idea seems logical and sensible, I'm of course interested in how exactly they are computed/calculated? 

In biological phylogenetics we of course have nucleotides or proteins as our primary unit, where patterns of mutation can be inferred according to a rate (molecular clock) and interesting patterns can pop up when populations are subjected to extreme changes. Do languages have a steady background evolutionary heartbeat? And how do you arrive at empirical data to back these things up?

But what are the units in linguistic language trees? In biology there's a phenotype-genotype divide, where in more complex creatures expression can cause notable differences in appearance despite identical genome sequences. 

I obviously want to draw relations, and I certainly don't have any reason to believe that everything between the two types of trees is 1:1, but I thought I'd just ask and see what all you experts think, or if you have any resources that a beginner could access?",1594090774,marazomeno,4

- where did the linguistic come up with this? did they overhear this during a conversation and then somehow notice the special property that it had? did they know what property they were looking for and then seek out a sentence with that property, and somehow stumble on this sentence (but how)?

I decided to do this for a couple reasons. The first is that usually you’ll see pinyin charts of all possible pinyin combinations, but several vowels in pinyin actually represent multiple unique vowel sounds. I wanted to make a chart that was as accurate as possible. 

Second is that I felt the available resources on erhua to non-natives to be lacking, so I’ve been working on resources myself. I haven’t been able to find any other IPA charts or sources that go over all the sounds possible with erhua, but it ended up being much larger than I expected. The Putonghua Proficiency Exam materials state that there are 189 erhua words that have been standardised, so I based all of my transcriptions on those words.

Any question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: 

*Quick questions:*

* Asking how we would transcribe something
* Asking how a feature works in a particular language

*Not-so-quick questions:*

* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

Also, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search.

linguistics,Thoughts on master's thesis concerning populist discourse in the media,"Hello everyone, I hope this is OK to post here (I did check the rules but I'm not sure if I should post here or in the higher education thread...?)

I'm going to be starting a masters in linguistics in the Netherlands soon, and within the first couple of weeks I'm expected to submit a research proposal. I'm particularly interested in propaganda and manifestation of language power structures and hierarchies (linguistic discrimination of supposed 'sub-standard' dialects/varieties/accents).

The problem I have is I don't know what to focus on - I don't have a pure linguistic background. I did modern languages at undergraduate, with Spanish and German. Although we did do some research on linguistic variation and change, particularly concerning racial and social prejudice towards non-standard variations with a focus on Latin American (namely Argentinian) Spanish, the evolution of medieval Spanish from Latin, prestige varieties and standardisation in general etc., I'm worried about coming across as if I don't have a clue what I'm on about. 

One of my ideas is to examine current populist discourse that has been labelled as propaganda on social media and media outlets, and evaluate it in regard to more 'traditional' forms of media used for the purpose of spreading propaganda (such as radio, posters etc.); basically, I want to see what main linguistic changes have occurred in say semantic choice, or has code-switching between dialects/varieties increased (was it even there to begin with etc.), and what/if/how the boundaries of defining what is propaganda has changed. As I speak German, Dutch and Spanish, I feel like I could compare a wide range of sources from different eras from different countries. Is this too vague? What would most people suggest would be better to focus on? Would a semantic/syntactic evaluation be better than say, code-switching? Should I focus on propaganda techniques and theory more?

I feel like I'm starting to overthink this, and that it might be too broad in scope/it would be easy to lose track and connect the ideas I have. Any thoughts? Any recommended papers/books I should look into? I have Lakoff's 'The Political Mind' on my list at the moment, as well as a handful of articles discussing newspapers and their use of propaganda techniques.",1594032102,MXinee,0

linguistics,Academic rigour in this sub,"Second edit: you know what, I totally stand corrected. The thread that tipped me to actually say something has been removed. Maybe I just need to revisit threads/comments that I see as being irrelevant/non-academic/whatever adjective you wanna use, to actually see this moderation. You live and learn! 



So I'm new here, pretty new to reddit on the whole, but I've seen this kinda discussion in a few other subs recently and I definitely feel it's relevant here - though I don't wanna step on anyone's toes. 

It seems as if the sub rule of ""avoid lay speculation and personal anecdotes"" is not enforced. Like at all. I've just been working through a few posts, sorted by new, and haven't seen any mod action anywhere at all. It seems the only way to avoid having a glut of lay replies is to make essentially an exclusionary, densely theoretical question/title. Anything that is vaguely socio-, or is a question *from* a layperson (which ofc is great!) then it seems to get piled on with ""feelings"". Obviously speaker insight can be invaluable, but only linguists have the knowledge to ask pointed questions that make those insights salient. 

Both r/askscience and r/AskHistorians seem to have a great handle on this - r/AskHistorians in particular being very heavily moderated to achieve it. We are probably all painfully aware of people referring to themselves as linguists without any real understanding of linguistic study (for anyone else, no, being multilingual does not make you a linguist, sorry). My suggestion would be mods deleting those comments, or in the absence of that we have to ruthlessly downvote, maybe? And also maybe closing a thread if it gets overloaded with lay replies? Idk, I'm just bringing attention to it, I guess. Because it's honestly lowkey cringe reading some threads. And there'll be a knowledgeable comment/reply in there but it's like a tiny speck of gold in a pan full of sludge.

ETA: tbf most of the new posts were the ones that made me realise theoretic titles naturally weeded-out lay responses, so maybe not the best example to say there was no mod action. But everything else stands.",1593975155,shitswildiknow,53

What have they been replaced by, if anything?

On a related note: in his 1988 textbook, written within the GB framework, Radford wrote:

&gt; Other traditional terms which can be defined in terms of dominance and precedence relations include grammatical relations such as 'Subject', 'Direct (or Primary) Object', 'Secondary Object', 'Prepositional Object', and so on. [...] Thus, we might define the relevant relations or functions in the following way (in the spirit of Chomsky's proposed definitions in *Lectures* (1981d), p. 42):

&gt; (6)(a) Subject of S = [NP, S]   
&gt; (b) Direct/Primary Object of VP = [NP_1, VP]
&gt; ...

(*Transformational Grammar*, Andrew Radford, Cambridge University Press, 1988, p. 112-113)

A few decades later Radford published another textbook, written within the Minimalist framework, expressing an opposite view:

&gt; Note that a number of other grammatical relations which traditional grammars make use of (e.g. relations like subjecthood and objecthood) are not relations which can be used within the Minimalist framework.

He asked his students to do a presentation for him only speaking following the linguistic rules he wrote down. And every time a student would slip up, he would verbally correct them. The conclusion was that by his correcting their attempts at code-switching, the students got more demoralized, spoke slower, and became more hesitant to speak out in class.

linguistics,"[Syntax] When speaking out your thoughts, does the phonological component have access to both the syntactic and the semantic forms?","A speech act has two orientations: from inside outward and vice versa, as follows.

* From inside outward: When I wish to express a thought in speech, the thought is fed to the semantic component that outputs a corresponding semantic representation that is fed to the syntax component that outputs a corresponding syntactic representation that is fed to the phonological component that produces a phonetic representation that is then played out by my speech organs.

* From outside inward: When someone tells me something by uttering a sentence, my auditory organs feed this sequence of sonoric signals to the phonological component that outputs a corresponding phonetic representation that is fed to the syntax component that outputs a corresponding syntactic representation that is fed to the semantic component that outputs a corresponding semantic representation that induces a corresponding thought in my mind.

Let's consider a speech act oriented from inside outward. In [an answer to a previous post of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/hki7pq/syntax_do_the_labels_of_a_phrase_structure_tree/) it was claimed that the pieces manipulated by the syntax component lack phonological content; this is the Late Insertion principle described on the first page of [this document](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/586960e5197aea52834230a2/t/5c07fca9898583587235007f/1544027307865/DM_ORE.pdf).

Now, let's assume, for the sake of simplicity, that the three components don't interleave their work, i.e. that the semantic component is activated only after the syntactic component has finished processing and produced an output, and likewise that the syntactic component is activated only after the semantic component has finished processing and produced an output. This assumption is not critical for my question, it just makes its statement simpler. Then at the time the phonological component is activated both the semantic and syntactic components have finished working and produced their respective outputs.

Are both outputs available for the phonological component, or only the one produced by the syntactic component?",1593865484,dodli,19

linguistics,Learning another language makes you realize how arbitrary English is,"I'm currently learning Arabic (Corona has given me much free time). Learning Arabic has made me realize some things that exist in English but not in other languages. 

For example, English has Capital Letters. What is the necessity of having capital letters? Why is it necessary too begin each sentence with a different form of the word to the point where you need an entire seperate case. It's such a trivial example, but learning a different language really opens your eyes up to interesting conventions. 

I'm literally a beginner right now, but here are some interesting conventions that seem somewhat arbitrary I noticed that exist in English.

1) Capital Letters - I talked about this above

2) there is no seperate letter for the sound 'sh' and 'th', arabic has this with ش and ظ. Also, the letter K exists even though C is perfectly viable because... why (and why do words with C have an 'S' sound in them ex. receive)?

3) Conjugation. I think this is a thing that English does that actually makes it easier compared to other languages. For example, if we take I, you, he/she, they, us, etc. These all have different conjugations in Spanish (6 forms I think) but there are only 2 versions of the conjugations in English. (Arabic is a whole other species when it comes to conjugations)

4) The Nominative Case. Quite literally, the word ""is"" is not necessary when using arabic in many cases. this is called the nominative case.

5) [Inconsistencies](https://aclassen.faculty.arizona.edu/content/english-language-crazy-inconsistencies) \- do I really have to explain?

Basically I’m asking to what degree your parents’ regional accents can influence your own. My grandparents were both born and raised in Boston (they’re both about 90 years old) and have extremely heavy Boston accents. Right after they got married they moved to Connecticut, where my mother and her siblings were raised.

Connecticut does not have a super noticeable accent unlike Boston and NY, but my mother and her siblings all seem to have noticeable Eastern New England accents. For example they lack the complete Mary/marry/merry merger (pronouncing “merry” very differently, which is consistent w/Eastern NE accents) and also have the tendency to add intrusive R’s (idea becomes idear, Martha becomes Marthar) as well as a distinct nasal short-A system (“have” and “cat” sound like “heeyav” and “keeyat.”) My older aunts and uncles even have a tendency to occasionally drop R’s when talking fast “The othah day.”

linguistics,[syntax] Do the labels of a phrase structure tree include phonetic instructions?,"Are the following statements correct per generative syntax theory, specifically per the current iteration of minimalism?

All nodes of a phrase structure tree are labeled with sets of features. For instance, the subject of ""we would like to stay"" is represented as the set of features {pronoun, 1st person, plural, nominative}.

Furthermore, the labels remain constant throughout the various analyses and transformations that the tree undergoes before being handed over to the logical and the phonetic subsystems.

Now, my question is this. Consider the silent PRO subject of the clause ""to stay"": ""we would like PRO to stay"". What is the set of features that is represented by PRO? Is it {pronoun, 1st person, plural}? Does it include a feature indicating that it is silent: {pronoun, 1st person, plural, silent}, or is the fact that it is silent decided by the phonetic subsystem (for instance based on the fact that it doesn't have a case feature)?

And how about the sentence ""I don't think you have been lying, even though other witnesses have (been lying)"". In this case the last couple words can be pronounced or can undergo ellipsis and remain silent. Is the decision whether to pronounce them left to the phonetic subsystem, or does the syntactic subsystem indicate this decision in the phrase structure tree using features or by simply leaving these words out of the tree if they are not supposed to be pronounced?

linguistics,An Interesting New way to look at Words,"I recently was researching and realized that the concept of a ""word"" is a concept made up by Europeans. Punctuation using commas, semicolons, spaces and dividing ""words"" was originally made not because of any objective reasoning to what was a word and what wasn't, but based on how much time speakers usually took between words. For instance, when I said ""for instance,"" just there in your head you probably imagined a longer space between ""instance,"" and ""when"" than ""for"" and ""instance"".  Though this was, for the time, a pretty intuitive way of figuring out how to divide words, it shows that our concept of what a word is is based on an inconsistent factor that isn't the same as our modern standards. I propose to you this, what if we considered a word as by the vague standards we have today and consider a word as simply any string of letters/morphemes that is indivisible. Allow me to demonstrate.

Correct Grammar:

TheyandI will fairlyoften gotothepark.

TheyandI fairlyoften will gotothepark.

TheyandI will gotothepark fairlyoften.

Correct in some British accents: gotothepark fairlyoften theyandI will. (notice how the accent evolved a different correct format but it still has the same 4 lines of speech in that order)

Understandable in colloquial speech:

Meandthem will fairlyoften gotothepark. (Even in this ""incorrect"" format it still obeys the rule of keeping the same lines of grammar the same, once again suggesting something about them is consistent.)

So you can now see the consistency in this different idea of what a ""word"" is. Interestingly, the word ""will"" seems to behave like a preposition.",1593746403,TloyCO,1

I need help weighing into a discussion, and as a lay person, I just simply dont quite know *what* or *how* to research to solve this. 

Here's my question:

If the Confederation of Canada was in 1867, is it correct to say: ""We celebrate the 153rd year since the Confederation of Canada""? Or is it correct to say, ""We celebrate the 154th year since...""? Or can *both* be valid depending on how one looks at it?

I am familiar with the whole ""year 0"" concept - that this is in fact Canada's 154th year. And I can understand that saying, ""we celebrate the 153rd year **of** the Confederation"" would be incorrect.

Here's why I think both could be right:

If I think of running around a track, I would say, once I have run around the track three times, ""I celebrate the 3rd lap since I started running."" In that sense, I celebrate the completion of each lap. When the third lap ends, and Im running my fourth,  I could either celebrate \[the end of\] the third lap, or \[the start of\] the fourth. In that sense, in the same moment, I would be right in saying ""I celebrate the 3rd lap since I started running"" AND ""I celebrate the 4th lap since I started running""?

So, in that sense, I could say, ""I celebrate the 153rd year since the Confederation"" (when thinking of the completion of 153 years), or ""I celebrate the 154th year since the Confederation"" (when thinking of the year we're ringing in). 

Lastly, while I *think* both are valid, would one make more sense than the other?

So then my question is: if there are certain innate “feelings” of masculine, feminine and however many other genders a language has for pronouns, and the words they’re used for inherently create gestalts in the speaker’s mind for what is “feminine” or what is “masculine”, is there any sort of extra level of language modification proposed in this era of third wave feminism and broader ideas of gender roles? Do experts think that this inherent gendering of the language will make these sorts of progressive changes more difficult to take hold, or is it largely considered to be negligible in the grand scheme of things?",1593605485,Bilbrath,176

linguistics,"Topics in psycholinguistics, processing and SLA - and how to stay up to date?","Hope this is allowed here. 

I'm writing my master's thesis in SLA next spring and later on I might like to apply for a PhD. I have a very general question about finding topics for theses and dissertations: how exactly does one go about learning where the ""forefront"" of research is, what's already been done and what's actually useful to do? I am so busy with my current studies and part-time job that I have very little time to read up on relevant journals and articles in my field in advance. It seems impossible to stay up to date with everything that's happening and paradigms shifting. For instance, the Revised Hierarchical Model of Bilingualism (which I referred to in my undergrad thesis 5 years ago) is apparently not very valid anymore? 

I know very well what my interests are, but how much guidance can I generally expect from my supervisor to make sure my projects turn out well? For my bachelor's thesis, I was blessed with an excellent supervisor who really wanted a collaborative process and constantly checked in to make sure I knew what to do. I am now at a different university and, having also worked with academic support and met many miserable students in their final year, I now know that getting a good supervisor can be a lottery. 

I am interested in language processing, word recognition, the mental lexicon (in particular!) and morphology in general. Also, I live in an EFL country so replicating research that's only been done in English could be interesting. My background is in general Linguistics and not Education, and I'd be more comfortable running experiments like lexical decision tasks with reaction time or something rather than classroom observations. Any pointers on where I should look for ideas would be fantastic. 

I received a lot of praise and encouragement as an undergrad and I continue to do well, but I can't shake the feeling that I should know more than I know and do much more than I do by now.

linguistics,A Hindi linguistics query regarding grammatical aspects.,"There are three grammatical aspects in Hindi: Perfective, Progressive and Habitual, and 5 moods: Indicative, Presumptive, Conditional, Imperative, Subjunctive (present &amp; future).

Examples these 3 aspects:

1. Perfective -  maiñ kiyaa hoon / main kiyaa.
2. Progressive - maiñ kar rahaa hũũ
3. Habitual - maiñ kartaa hũũ

Now, besides these there are other such forms which seem to be related but I find no information whatsoever about these following on the internet in no research work on Hindi Grammar as if they don't even exist. They seem to be a combination of habitual and progressive aspects.

1. maiñ kartaa rahaa thaa (habitual + progressive)
2. maiñ kartaa rehtaa hũũ (habitual + habitual)
3. maiñ kiyaa rahaa thaa (perfective + progressive)

they seem to me like they are aspects themselves. Somewhere I also read that Hindustani cannot form progressive forms of habitual, which clearly is false as the example is right above and I think it's super common to form habitual + habitual forms and habitual + progressive forms. The perfective + progressive forms are also common but only for certain verbs like ""baiThnaa"",  ""baiThaa honaa"", ""khaRaa honaa"" etc. The verbs which usually convey a state. For example, ""baiThaa rahaa thaa"".


So, like why these forms have no existence in any research paper and should they be considered as separate aspects? Or, maybe a subdivision of these 3 aspects? (although the later seems a little odd to me).",1593474120,itsmeyash31,4

My question is, has the same process occurred in French? French has the same distinction as English with Je vs Moi so I'm wondering if this is a fossilized form of the dative case from Latin that lingered after French lost cases descending from Vulgar Latin; the same process as in English.

linguistics,A question.,"I'm having a difficult time explaining to someone on the internet (naturally, as I'm sure if we'd been face to face and they had visual queues from my facial expression and audio queues from my voice they'd have realized I wasn't arguing) that saying an opposing opinion in a conversational manner while explaining why I think that way isn't ""arguing"" as the term is used modernly.

&gt; ""ar·gue

&gt; /ˈärɡyo͞o/

&gt; verb

&gt; give reasons or cite evidence in support of an idea, action, or theory, typically with the aim of persuading others to share one's view.""

I can see where the confusion comes from as it just says ""***typically*** with the intention of convincing the other party"", but there is undoubtedly a difference between me saying ""I personally think it's this and here is why I think that way"" and saying ""it's obviously this and these are the reasons why your stance is wrong"". I've explained that one is giving an opinion in a conversational manner with no intention of changing any minds while as the other is made with the intention of changing the person's mind and is *presented* as an argument. There's a nuance here that I'm having trouble getting across. Maybe I should give the definition of ""opinion"" or ""discussion"" to get the point across?

linguistics,How do we actually distinguish agglutinative from analytic languages?,"I'm a layman and I have no formal training in linguistics. I do know both an analytic language (if English counts) and an agglutinative one (though neither natively) and the following came to mind as I was thinking about agglutination.


I'll start off by saying that I'm not at all sold to the idea of the concept ""word"" being at all meaningful. I understand the concepts ""morpheme"", ""phrase"", and ""clause"" and to me they have rigorous and meaningful definitions to them. However, the concept ""word"" seems to float somewhere between the former two and I see no possibility to draw a hard line. Attempts to define the concept ""word"" and why they fail in my mind:

1. ""That which is separated by spaces"" - Language is speech; spaces, just like all writing, are an arbitrary human construct. This breaks down further considering languages with no spaces like Japanese.

2. ""The smallest thing that can be used in isolation to convey meaning"" - I'm not convinced that English ""words"" like ""to"" or ""the"" convey any meaning in isolation. This seems to be just as nonsensical as uttering some affixes of an agglutinative language in isolation. On the flipside, utterances like ""m'm"" ought to be words because they convey meaning used in isolation.

3. ""That which can be reordered within a sentence"" - That's a phrase.

Now on to agglutination: In absence of a universal definition of the concept ""word"", how can we distinguish between analytic and agglutinative languages? Common definitions seem to focus either on spelling, which is not an inherent quality of the language, or on words, which is an ill-defined concept (to the best of my understanding).

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutination) gives the following definition for agglutination: ""Agglutination is a linguistic process pertaining to derivational morphology in which complex words are formed by stringing together morphemes without changing them in spelling or phonetics."" This definition seems to me to be problematic in two different ways: Firstly the usage of ""word"" in absence of a universal definition of said concept, and moreover the dependence on spelling in light of the fact that spelling is an arbitrary human construct and a mere attempt to capture language. What I get from this definition is that agglutination is a derivational morphological process that operates ""locally"" (""without change in phonetics""). This definition seems utterly implausible to me; consider vowel harmony, consonant gradation, connected speech and so on. I assume most languages traditionally said to be agglutinative fail to conform to this definition.

My questions:

- Is there a universal and rigorous definition of the concept ""word"" that coincides with neither ""morpheme"" nor ""phrase""?

- How can we distinguish between analytic and agglutinative languages? Are there universal and rigorous definitions of these concepts?",1593355457,Fytcha,18

linguistics,Why is there an Indo-European bias in dictionaries?,"Why is it that when words in proto Uralic and proto Indo-European languages are cognates, linguistics always assume that the word is always originally from Indo-European language, never the other way around. They do this even without any evidence.

 For example in one of the biggest Finnish etymology dictionary, the word ""water"" in both proto Uralic and proto Indo-European have either a common origin or the word is a loan from Proto Indo-European to proto Uralic. The only ""evidence"" they have for this is the assumption that usually words are loaned from more developed societies to less developed societies. This is not a proof at all, so why is it mentioned at all in the book, and why is the possibility that it could be loaned from proto Uralic not mentioned at all. There are many cases where less developed societies have given words to more developed societies.

 Another thing they mentioned in the book about the word ""water"" is that because of phonetical reasons, it must have been loaned from the Proto Indo-European language. The most common theory is that they have the same origin, so why are there any arguments based on phonetics at all?

Possibly, I'd be interested in taking part in a linguistic experiment, like a simulation of the emergence and development of a language from the start. I think the internet could be a good environment to try something like that. Anything like that going on somewhere?

linguistics,"What's wrong with the Indonesian ""southeast""?!","I've been learning Indonesian for quite a while now and there's one particular word that really bugs me. When someone is talking about directions in Indonesian or Malay, they use ""**barat** *laut*"" and ""**barat** *daya*"" for *north***west** and *south***west**. To say *north***east** they use the word ""**timur** *laut*"" and at this point literally anyone would expect to see ""**timur** *daya*"" being used for *south***east.**

But that's not true. For some reason Indonesian and Malay have a special word for the southeast direction - tenggara. When I first saw it, I was really curious and wanted to find its origin in order to understand why this direction is different from the other ones. However, to my regret, I wasn't able to find any information about it. The only thing that the internet showed me was some guy saying that the word might be coming from Tamil. A good friend of mine from Indonesia (who is the reason why I started learning the language at the first place) couldn't help me either. 

Lacking information I had only one choice - to think about it myself. So here is my theory.

First of all the word ""tenggara"" sounds somehow close to the word negara, which means ""country"". That's why my brain automatically connected the word's uniqueness to the country's geographical location. Indonesia itself is a country in Southeast Asia, so I thought that it might be the reason for Indonesians to call the direction by a name that is a little different from the other ones. For example, when people are going home, they don't call it ""the building where I live"", but instead we use a special word for it - home. 

However I do not consider myself a linguist in any way, so I thought that maybe I could find some help here. I am really confused and curious, so I am wondering if anyone can tell me whether my theory is at least somewhat correct or not.",1593277005,jeyqjeyy,40

linguistics,“Airport” and other words that seem to have been made up on the spot,"A few years ago I realized suddenly that I love the word “airport” because it’s like, when planes came around we just sort of applied the word “port” to where they would dock (cause it’s a port!) and threw in a modifier that this port was for air-things.

Since then I’ve been trying to find other examples of things like this, but I don’t think they all really work, and some of them are just cute straightforward compound words like “fireplace” (it’s where the fire goes!).

linguistics,"SLA - the perfect curriculum, what would you include?","Hi,

I’m an English teacher/researcher here in japan. With covid and all, I’ve been left without a research project for the summer so I thought I would do something a bit more exploratory and consider what makes the perfect curriculum.

What id like to discuss, if anyone is interested in this topic, are theories or methodologies that should definitely be included in the perfect curriculum. The only conditions I’m applying to this scenario is that the target students would be at pre-int and the curriculum would take them to intermediate.

A couple of things I’ve thought of so far:

Balance of the four strands. Not your reading, speaking, listening and writing, but meaning focused output, input, fluency development and language focused learning. I too often see too much focus on grammar and not enough practice.

There’s a lot to be said about which methods and techniques should be employed for the above strands. Collaborative work is a must. Glossing for readings, communicative tasks and TBLT. If there was a hierarchy of teaching techniques that would be useful for narrowing down the techniques to be used.

Vocabulary frequency. The curriculum would have to allow for revision of the most frequent 2000 words in a broad way as to not neglect any particular vocabulary. Also, vocabulary from the 2000-3000 band should be the target vocabulary throughout the curriculum.

One thing I have yet to work out is how many hours would be required for such an endeavor. This would probably require an investigation into how many words learners can be expected to learn on a per lesson basis and divide that by the 2000-3000 word band.

Which grammar points and in which order? Does order even matter?

Testing. What kind of tests would best monitor progress but also not get in the way and take up too much class time.

Anyway, this is just a start and mostly just ideas off the top of my head for now. Would love to hear what ideas people have out there.

linguistics,In regard to the etymology of “warm”,"I wanted to talk about a confusing parallel between indo-European and Semitic, and ask if there was anyone who could explain. So English “warm” comes from Proto-Germanic “warmaz” (For purposes of length, I’m going to be cutting down on any unnecessarily long paths regarding etymology. Just know that I’m not implying that “warm” came straight form protogermanic, but took its time through old English to Anglo Frisian and west germanic and the like.) “warmaz” comes from a modified version of the indoeuropean stem gʷʰer-, taking on the form of gʷʰor-mó-s. Another form of this stem is in gʷʰer-mó-s, which went down the Hellenic route to create Ancient Greek θερμός. That’s all well and good, but what’s really striking is another etymology for that Ancient Greek word could be, according to wiktionary, from Akkadian 𒋻𒄷 (TAR.MUŠ8) (Sumerian has the exact same word, but this is most likely through borrowing), which also has cognates from various other Semitic languages. This is seems to be in conflict with it being an indo-European word, so I’m just a bit confused. If θερμός came from indoeuropean, then why is there connection to not only Akkadian  and the other Semitic languages but also to Sumerian? If it’s a Semitic borrowing, than how can the Ancient Greek word have connection to the indo European word gʷʰer-mó-s, which itself Descended into other indo European languages that were far away from Semitic influence?",1593182974,PD049,11

Not sure if this is the right sub so let me know if there are any other subs I can post this on.

I'm looking for words similar to the ancient greek word 'arete' for a business name. It is a consultancy where we implement trading strategies and maximise the potential of the strategy the client presents us with.

I'm also looking to pair it with a technical term for the 'competitive edge' of the strategy: alpha. Thus I was originally thinking of ""Arete Alpha"". However I am not keen with a) pronunciation -&gt; spelling difficulty (when saying the business name to potential clients), b) similarity to arrête (stop in French) and arête (mountainous ridge) and c) not sure it's a particularly well known word (I've had to explain the meaning to everyone so far!). I was also looking at 'telos' however it turns out ""Telos Alpha"" is some company promoting firearms in the US or something... not sure I want to be associated with that (plus they have the .com domain.)

I would appreciate it if you could leave any suggestions for words, foreign words or terms (preferably Greek to match with 'alpha' but not necessary) which expresses: maximising/fulfilling potential, maximum performance, excellence, perfection etc.

linguistics,Are there purposes on agreements (I am vs he is; one boy vs two boys; un homme vs une femme)?,"Agreements eg: verb conjugation according to the subject; article and adjective change form according to the noun, and many more.

I'm not saying there must be a purpose.  People in the past could just happen to choose to use such structures.  But having purposes behind such a choice is also possible.

Imagine a language in which basic words such as water are 100-syllable long.  Possible?  possible.  Purpose? may be none, those people just like it.  But this complexity has a cost in daily lives, in length of conversation, and also in difficulties in learning/memorising.  If you find this language in use you may want to ask why.

Even native Germans sometimes 'complain' on der/die/das.  That must be self-referential humor, but the complexity should be real.

Yes agreement is a characteristic of inflecting languages, but are there studies on the purposes if any, and benefits, of doing so?

My random thoughts are: 1) so that word order is of little to no importance;  2) modifiers and the modified can be far separated; 3) chance to recover unheard or misheard information by the remaining part of speech that is heard.  I'm close to violating rule 4 here so I stop.",1592918211,Kafatat,1

Our weekly Q&amp;A thread is the perfect place to post them! A new Q&amp;A thread goes up every Monday, but we have people who read them regularly throughout the week.

**What counts as a “quick question”?**

Any question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: 

*Quick questions:*

* Asking for an explanation of a technical term
* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature
* Asking how we would transcribe something
* Asking how a feature works in a particular language

*Not-so-quick questions:*

* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

Also, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first.

linguistics,"Maghrebi Arabic, an official language of the European Union ??","The languages of the European Union are the official languages of its members.
  Example : French is the official language of France, Luxembourg and Belgium so it's one of the official languages in EU.

Malta joined the EU in 2004 so its official language, the Maltese, became an EU language. 
According to Wikipedia, Maltese is a Latinised variety of spoken historical Arabic through its descent from Siculo-Arabic, which developed as a Maghrebi Arabic dialect. The Maltese language is believed to be derived from Siculo-Arabic and ultimately from Tunisian Arabic, as it contains some typical Maghrebi Arabic areal characteristics. Tunisian Arabic dialect and Maltese are partially intelligible which is one of the criteria for belonging to the same language.
Moreover Maltese is classified as a Maghrebi Arabic language (like Tunisian or Algerian Arabic) 

People usually say that the Algerians, Tunisians and Moroccans speak Arabic, can we do the same with the Maltese ? 
Is Maltese technically a part of Arabic macro-language as the other Arabic dialects ? If yes why it's not recognize by the ISO 639-3 ?
Can we say Maghrebi Arabic and Arabic macro-language are official languages of EU under their Maltese form ?

I know that Maltese was influenced lexically by French, Italian so many of its words have Latin roots and some people argue that is not even an Arabic dialect. But despite the influence of French and Latin in English (~60% of the vocabulary) it is always referred as a Germanic Language, so why couldn't Maltese be an Arabic language?

I'm trying to be concise and specific to better clarify what I'm trying to get at.  

Consider two distinctive phrases on opposite ends of the spectrum of specificity, subjectivity, and number of fairly synonymous phrases: 

1. Dogs like food
2. Small dogs of the same breed are %X more likely to overeat when given food of Y proportion to their body weight (pretend cited study)

Also consider what I mean in my title:

1. Synonymous phrases: Phrases where one or more words can be changed to modify, maintain, or specify meaning at varying levels
2. Varying length: Can lead to significantly more complexity but also more specificity, meaning far less variant synonymous phrases being possible without changing meaning
3. Specificity: The amount which a change on phrasing or word use may change constraints/meaning of a phrase.
4. Subjectivity: Identifying words or phrases that are less factual and more or entirely subjective based on words like ""like/want/believe""
5. More: Other constraints for a machine learning model or fact checker that may help in approaching the probability a statement is factual

As someone studying machine learning and its applications in fact checking text statements, I'm wondering about:

1. ...the feasibility of a generalized fact-checking mechanism which rates the probability of any given phrase being misleading, subjective, factual, etc. 
2. ...potential problems about the complexity of the English language, especially as specificity goes down and subjectivity goes up, causing far more synonymous statements to be possible.  That said, the advent of decent translators gives me hope that we could train a reasonably fast and accurate 'fact checking' or more realistically 'reliability probability' ML model.

At the risk of being pedantic, in many languages with noun declensions (I'm thinking Greek, Latin, Russian, etc.), various prepositions are assigned to their respective cases to convey a certain meaning, so that you use both a preposition and a case ending. By **""optional"" declension**, I mean a language where one can decline a noun, but does not need to decline the noun if they use an equivalent preposition. For instance, one could use the dative case to express indirect object, or they could use the prepositions ""to"" or ""for"" with the base (nominative) form of the noun.

We seem to have something like this in English, particularly when expression possession (e.g. ""*John's* House"" vs. ""The House *of John*""), but much less commonly in an allative sense (e.g. ""He went *to the north*"" vs. ""He went *northward*"").

linguistics,DP phrases with null determiner in English,"I am not very well read on syntactic theories of determiner phrases in English so I was wondering if someone more knowledgeable could help me on where this has been been written about before. 

It seems to me like the diverse circumstances where the determiner is absent can actually be surmised in a single feature. I propose the following ‘if x ∈ {x} and not larger then the determiner is null. If x implies x ∈ {x,y...} by then the determiner is ‘a’ or ‘the’.’ The determiner therefore measures the cardinality of the set to which the noun phrase it c-commands belongs in English. 

I’ll give three examples of how this one rule seems to explain the facts. 

Names are the easiest. Clearly any name is a set of itself and no other element is a member of that set. 

In idiomatic phrases like ‘I go to school’ the variable x is bound and not assigned any specific value ie x ∈ {x}. However as soon as we make the variable free it needs to take a value to receive a denotation. It then becomes an element in the set with cardinality &gt; 1 and therefore the determiner is no longer null. ‘I go to school there’ ‘really what’s the school like?’

Uncountable nouns by definition are members of their own set and not any others (without further elaboration). Uncountable nouns can exceptionally occur with determiners however if we newly construct a set for the uncountable noun eg ‘I believe in the justice of human rights’ here x ∈ {x,y} whereby is justice of some other kind. 

Finally plurals. ‘I love dogs’ implies the set of all dogs, in other words where is the referent and only the referent of the phrase we again have x ∈ {x} and ¬(x ∈ {x,y}. 

As I said I’d love to have some papers linked on this and/or raise counter examples to this analysis.

linguistics,"Does anybody know about work regarding the ""answerability"" of interrogative sentences vs. queries?","Hi. The title is a little ambiguous, so let me provide a bit of background. I'm currently an MSCS student who's working on natural language processing. Right now my team and I are trying to build a question answering system, and I became curious if there was any work that highlighted how answerable questions are depending on their form.

For example, it's not hard to notice that interrogative sentences are much easier to answer than the same question being in a short, keyword-based query format (as the definition of something being ""interrogative"" itself means it's a question). Something like ""What are the symptoms of COVID-19?"" is much easier (or at least more natural) to answer than ""COVID-19 symptoms.""

linguistics,Why is Russian losing popularity so quickly in the former Soviet Union?,"From both anecdotal evidence and amateur research, Russian seems to be \*rapidly\* falling out of favor in the other former Soviet Republics (be they Baltic, East Slavic, Caucasian, or Central Asian), even more so in the former East Bloc. While it's clear that for many Russian is a symbol of the population transfers and aggressive Russification of the Soviet Union beginning in the 1930s (and seen more generally as an antithesis to Westernization and a link to Russia), the rate at which Russian is being dropped from education and public life in general seems incredibly surprising. To clarify, I'm using Aneta Pavlenko's [2013 report](http://www.anetapavlenko.com/pdf/Language_and_Linguistics_Compass_2013.pdf) and this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_distribution_of_Russian_speakers) in making these assumptions, so correct me if I'm wrong.

What I guess I'm still confused about is why Russian has suffered such rapid attrition in these spaces, while languages like French in Africa or Portuguese/English in Africa and South/Southeast Asia continue to flourish in their former colonies. While English, especially since decolonization, is widely accepted as a lingua franca and all the abovementioned languages are spoken in some nations with incredible linguistic diversity (e.g. DRC, Angola), these nations' legacies of colonialism were just as horrible, and many nations (e.g. Madagascar, Algeria) already have a near-universal indigenous language (and in Algeria's case, very negative relations with the former metropole).

linguistics,Is there a reason why certain conventions are disregarded in colloquial speech in some languages but not in others?,"For instance: In English, the relative pronoun e.g. ""that"" has become increasingly omitted in colloquial speech: *The food ~~(that)~~ I bought*.

I believe this is not the case for many other IE langauges, which mostly retain the relative pronouns even though omitting them does not affect the comprehensibility of the sentence.

linguistics,Question about factive predicates with non-clausal complements," 
I’m not informed in semantics, and would appreciate your help in a problem I ran into. 

Factive predicates entail (or presuppose) the truth of their clausal complement, and this is true also under negation:

1. John is (un)aware that Mary is sick —&gt; Mary is sick

My question is regarding cases where the complement of the factive verb is not a clause (nor propositional). I noticed the following:

2. John is (un)aware of the problem —&gt; there is a problem

3. John is aware of a problem —&gt; there is a problem

However,
4. John is unaware of a problem -x-&gt; there is a problem. 

It seems that existence is not entailed if the complement is indefinite. 

My hunch is that in the case of definites, there is an existence presupposition which is projected in the case of negation. In the case of indefinites, the is no presupposition so there’s nothing to be projected. (and in 3 it is understood that there is a problem because of existential closure?)

I would appreciate any guidance or reading recommendations.

linguistics,Is there a consensus on whether morphology is considered when deciding if something is phonemic?,"I've heard arguments that minimal pairs both do and don't count when they are the result of morphology.

The [1anden]+[2anden] minimal pair (numbers being pitch) apparently isn't phonemic because they derive from predictably-pitched roots.

And then there's on the other hand examples like an apparently phonemic contrast in London between holy+wholly, due to wholly preserving the /l/-coda vowel from 'whole'.

Impersonal Inflection Language- Language where there are 0 argument inflections

linguistics,"Comparing human language to language of Dolphins, Chickens &amp; Squid","Lets just jump into it

So the first thing were gonna talk about is Dolphin Language

We have no idea what their saying because dolphin phonemes work extensively differently than ours, it is impossible for humans to hear some of the distinctions. However, we do know they have a sequence of phonemes. Also, they seem to speak to each other way more than one would imagine, as in they will let the other speak for awhile (Estimate of 5 words) and then talk. So, when Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy said Dolphins were smarter than Humans, it wasn't far off. Humans evolved the ability to speak and THEN conquered the World more because of a different trait.

Second is chicken speak

Chickens have far less advanced Language than we or dolphins do but ,due to it being helpful to farmers, we do have a way of fully translating it all 26  into English. Which means you too, can learn to speak to chickens, in Chicken. 

around 27 phonemes. Words have meanings similar to human sentences, the difference being they are inseparable. One could say that it is fusional almost, as each word can only mean addressing ""you"" ""it"" or ""I"" and can only be a command, statement, or question, but no mixture can occur. 

What does this tell us about Human language

1. Words and Sentences at one point in evolution were indistinguishable
2. There is a fundamental difference between Vocatives and grammar, vocatives uses words like ""huh"" ""hey"" ""haha"" in English and seem to evolve very slowly along with being universally understood by all of a species as well as sounding similar to species relatives (You'll notice Chimps, Monkeys, Gorillas say hu when surprised and laugh with HAHAHAHA sound). Chicken do not have less complex grammar, they simply have more Vocatives.

 [https://flipflopranch.com/chicken-talk/](https://flipflopranch.com/chicken-talk/) 

Third is Squid Language

Squids talk through their skin with 14 patterns. We do not know specifics just that their language is very complex. Maybe so much so that they communicate better than us. They can change between many colors within seconds suggesting A. They think Quickly and B. These 14 patterns may act as Phonemes. More importantly, Squids literally have more advanced speaking in the sense that they have 2 more dimensions than our speaking. A squid can send a message to the squid in front of it and behind it at the same time, 2 different messages to 2 different people at the same time. 

Also, unlike humans or dolphins, the squid's thinking and speaking are connected. A squid does not choose to speak, a squid's thoughts cause it to make the ""speech"" pattern. So in a sense, one could say squids communicate to each other through telepathy. 

If Humans are the most intelligent species simply because we can more easily communicate our thought processes to other Humans, than most certainly Squids are more intelligent than us.

linguistics,"Good at learning languages, even better at forgetting them! What's your method to remember?","I'm 61 now and have spent the whole of my adult life learning languages. I studied Farsi and Turkish at university (SOAS, London) which also included a delightful year of pure linguistics. I've probably learned 11 languages very well (I never like to use the word fluently!), another seven or eight moderately well and dabbled with a dozen more. I've lived in quite a few different countries and have always done my best to learn the local language.

English is my native language but I spent seven years in Spain and have had a Mexican girlfriend for the last ten years. I've lived in Mexico the last three years and am pretty happy swapping between Spanish of Spain and Spanish of Mexico. I'm amazed at how the two are so different :-)

Some of my favorite languages have been Thai, Turkish, Farsi and Bulgarian. 

Thai: once you get to grips with the five tones and the 30 odd different vowels it's really pretty straightforward. I found it a lot easier than Mandarin or Vietnamese although I did have the advantage of living there for 18 months and later having a good Thai friend in Europe for three years to practise with. The written language is not particularly phonetic and they don't leave spaces between words but it's good fun to learn.

Turkish: great learning an agglutinative language and one with consonant and vowel harmony at that. Generally an interesting and nice sounding language.

Farsi: an Indo-European language so with a lot of the things you'd might expect with that category of language. The grammar is really pretty simple and the pronunciation straightforward; probably qāf (a uvular plosive) and gheyn (a velar fricative) are the only letters needing a bit of work to start with. I enjoyed using the Arabic script too. I did work as a translator/interpreter for two years as well as spending 8 months in Iran.

Bulgarian: I had to learn this language in a hurry as I started working on a project out there but I had a head start as I knew a bit of Russian. Verbs are a lot of work in Bulgarian and of course you've got the perfective and imperfective version of each verb to learn as in many Slavic languages. There are a huge number of possible conjugation paradigms. I particularly like the post enclitic article (as in Swedish or Romanian but with multiple forms) and the initial consonant clusters you get with some words - vkljuchva = to include.

However to get back to my original point, although I find I can pick up languages fairly quickly and these days have the necessary ""toolkit"" to get going with them, I also find I start forgetting them as soon as a few years have passed without having used them. I'm pretty sure that with a couple of months in the country a lot would come back but it's frustrating if I find myself confronted with a German, let's say, and the words just won't come out. It's a matter of the active vocabulary more than anything that slips away - reading and aural understanding are not so affected with time and for whatever reason grammar sticks forever (probably just the sad case of my being enthralled with grammar!).

The final chapter in the Routledge series *The Munda Languages* has a brief summary:

1. Nihali was first spoken in central western India by a nomadic group of raiders, who slowly migrated into eastern India. ""It was a representative of a family no longer found in India... there may well have been related languages in earlier times.""

2. Nihali speakers interacted with the Munda speakers of eastern India, borrowing and lending words. At this point, the indigenous Nihali morphosyntax was probably intact, ""whatever it was – not much of it is left and/or identifiable.""

3. These Nihali-speaking hill raiders were regularly the subject of genocidal campaigns by local rulers. In the eighteenth century, Nihali communities (""men, women, and children alike"") were nearly totally annihilated by the Marathas.

4. Due to this trauma, ""the older language [was] remade and socially reconfigured with a 'creole-style' grammar... used as a secret language, perhaps with argot-style speech deformation in some of the lexicon. The tense/aspect, etc. markers, indeed most of the morphemes used are familiar from a number of languages of the area, but they are not used in the same way, that is, this does not look like a case of 'natural genetic' inheritance.""

Quite sad and interesting, but from this discussion it seems clear that Nihali is a creole. So why does Wikipedia consider it a language isolate and not a creole?

Extremely many words were borrowed from Arabic and Persian, but I think even that the high-ranking officials did not communicate in ""Ottoman Turkish"" with each other. 

What I think is that the spoken variant of Turkish in the Ottoman Empire was in fact very similar to the Turkish spoken today. In fact the Azeri Turks were never a part of the Ottoman Empire but their language is extremely mutually compatible, and all Azeris understand Turkish. 

After all, Atatürk did a major language reform but it cannot be the case that the spoken language changed suddenly very much as well.

linguistics,Are the white/bright/good and black/dark/evil associations linguistic universals?,"In a discussion on another sub, a tech worker mentioned that someone in his firm believed that the tech jargon ""black hat,"" meaning ""unethical,"" was racist. The term truly comes from an old genre convention in [Western movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_white_hat_symbolism_in_film), but someone tendentious enough could argue that this convention *itself* was a result of filmmakers' racism.

The linguistic analogy between light/dark and good/evil, though, can be found well before modern multicultural societies. This [article](https://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2009/12/the-light-and-dark-of-language.html), for instance, says that the first metaphorical uses in English of the word *black* to mean *evil* date from the late 16th century. It cites a [journal article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/538382) mentioning that in the realm of mythology and folklore, the association is universal, including among ethnic groups that considered themselves to have dark complexions: good and evil gods and other supernatural figures are consistently portrayed as bright- and dark-colored, respectively.

A few other linguistic examples, unfortunately all Indo-European:

* Latin *sordidus* ""dirty, filthy, base,"" from a root meaning ""black"" (cognate with German *schwarz*, English *swarthy*); also *candor* ""whiteness, purity, beauty,"" and *denigrare* ""to blacken; to defame""
* Greek λευκός ""white,"" also metaphorically ""fortunate, happy""
* Sanskrit सुवर्ण​ *suvarṇa* ""radiant, golden,"" by literal etymology ""good-colored""
* More contemporary: German *Schwarzfahren* ""fare evasion on public transport,"" literally ""black riding""

linguistics,HathiTrust Download Help - Historical phonology of Sinhala : from old Indo-Aryan to the 14th century A.D. / by W.S. Karunatillake.,"Hello friends,

There is a certain published thesis I've been trying to obtain for ages, **W.S. Karunatillake's ' Historical phonology of Sinhala : from old Indo-Aryan to the 14th century A.D.'**. I've looked *everywhere* online and it is nowhere to be found in full. Google Books only has snippets and none of the popular file-sharing sites have it.

I've tried contacting the publishing company (Godage International Publishers) on several occasions although it apparently is out of print. There are no other online vendors (e.g. Amazon) who sell this book. The nearby universities that hold this item do not offer public access to the specific libraries in which it is found. It appears that there is no possible way for a civilian, non-researcher/student to get this book.

However, the thesis (in microfilm form) seems to be published in full at the HathiTrust digital library. As I currently do not belong to a university, however, I am unable to access this resource at   [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015061607860](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015061607860) .

I was wondering if anyone with a **HathiTrust login** could possibly help me out here. If there is anyone who could possibly download the book using their account and send it to me through PM's, I would be ***extremely*** grateful for your efforts. This book means a lot to me, and this request is one of desperation (as all others attempts to get this book were futile).

linguistics,"""India"" - Why Plural in Some Languages (Polish, Czech)?","*Edit: It is plural in Polish, but not Czech*

The name of the country India is singular in most languages, but there is an exception: Polish. 

In Polish, it's ""Indie"" (lit. ""Indias""). It is 100% plural in all contexts (e.g. Byłem w Indiach w zeszlym roku &gt; lit. ""I was in Indias last year"" &gt; ""I went to India last year"").

The question is - *why* is it plural in Polish? How did that come to be?

I've looked up the etymology in Polish dictionaries, though that didn't provide any info on this.

I've asked a few people - One theory was that it could be because of Russia's historic influence over Poland and Russia's relations with India. This would make sense, except it doesn't... because India is singular in Russian 😁

I've asked a few coworkers from India in whether it was thought of as singular or plural, and they all said it was definitely singular. My coworkers also seemed a little offended, like it was divisive towards India to speak of / think of it as (many) ""Indias"".

linguistics,Interesting change in the pronunciation of /sts/ codas in American English?,"I've noticed an interesting phenomenon where the coda /sts/ in words like breakfasts, ghosts, texts, etc. is pronounced [sɨz / sɪz / səz] - so imagine *lists* [lɪsts] becoming *lisses* [ˈlɪs.ɨz], rhyming with *misses*. I've noticed this change in my girlfriend's idiolect (a native speaker of Norcal English), and she applies it completely regularly - in fact, having difficulty articulating the coda in the prestige manner; I enjoy teasing her with this poem:

""Amidst the mists and fiercest frosts,  
With barest wrists, and stoutest boasts,  
He thrusts his fists against the posts,  
And still insists he sees the ghosts.""

Here, *mists*, *frosts*, *wrists*, *boasts*, *thrusts*, *fists*, *posts*, and *ghosts* each have two syllables when my gf says them (*insisses* has three).

Now, simplifying the coda is one thing - we've all reduced /sts/ to /s/ at times - texts become tex in quick speech - but this particular change is intriguing to me. I've noticed it among only a few speakers (my coworker this morning who was talking about *breakfasses*, Cardi B talking about how she loves ""*texes* from her exes"") but I'm certain that it's more widespread than my experience alone could inform. 

I'm still waffling over what exactly to call this phenomenon - is it substitution, or vocal epenthesis, or something else? Is it a phonological repair strategy? What I like about this sound change is that it makes the pluralization much more salient in terms of audibility. Given that word final /t/ is often unreleased or glottalized, it can be hard to hear the difference between the singular and plural of these words in certain contexts. *Context*, for example, can sound very similar if one says *this context* (unreleased t) vs *these contex* (completely elided t like in ""she sent me two different *tex*""). 

However, with *contexes*, you're actually preserving more information - instead of reducing the number of phonemes, you're just changing one of them so as to encode both the coda of the first word (with t being a negligible loss since it may not always be audible) as well as the normal pluralization marker!

Has anyone else noticed this particularity? Has anyone done research on it? I wanted to share my observations to see if this is something other people have noticed, since apparently it went unnoticed by his conversational partner when my coworker said *breakfasses*; I noticed it immediately when my gf said it, and I've noticed the sound every time since, so I'm wondering if it's just my linguist ear. I love hearing it, though, since it's mainly just a fun linguistic quirk that endears me further to my gf :)",1591806386,AtheistTardigrade,5
linguistics,"Any studies connecting linguistics to philosophy? (The ""is-ought problem"" as an example)","Is there any work that attempts to analyze linguistics from a philosophical perspective?

The is-ought problem states that many people make statements about what *ought to be* based on what *is*.

I was wondering if this could be applied to the concept of prescription. For instance, just because English utilizes do-support unlike most other IE languages, does that also mean it ought to utilize do-support? Words that enter popular usage for whatever reason eventually become prescribed, for instance, via its addition to dictionaries. But ought we allow that to be the case - that we should officially recognize new words just because they became popularized?

I see some sort of ""trend"" between the strong verbs ablaut vowels and the vowels in their causative derivatives, at least in the infinitives. I'll plagiarise Wikipedia here:

    1. ei [usually spelled ī tho?] &gt; ai (beitaną &gt; baitjaną)
    
    2. eu &gt; au (beuganą &gt; baugijaną)

    6. a &gt; a (faraną &gt; farjaną) (akin to ferry?)

Is there a more detailed ""rulebook"" for these derivations anywhere, or is there basically only a handful of reconstructions from verbs known to have had derivatives?

b) Note that there's two derivates from \*faraną.

About the second,

* Wikipedia says ""an archaic instance of the *o*\-grade ablaut used despite the differing past-tense ablaut"".
* But Wiktionary says ""Probably the causative-iterative to the lost strong verb *\**feraną.""

Any question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: 

*Quick questions:*

* Asking for an explanation of a technical term
* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature
* Asking how we would transcribe something
* Asking how a feature works in a particular language

*Not-so-quick questions:*

* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

Also, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search.

linguistics,What am I getting myself into?,"Hello. I am I naive undergraduate who just completed their first year of college.  I entered having no idea what to major in but ultimately declared as a linguistics major, as I had started studying french the previous summer and wanted to continue learning languages. However, throughout Intro. to Linguistics, I was not 100% enthralled by the course content.  But that's not to say I didn't find some parts interesting.  Unfortunately, I have already forgotten  much of this content and still have a surface level understanding of linguistics.  For lack of having any other major to resort to, I decided to continue with linguistics and am registered for more advanced classes next semester.

Is linguistics really for a wannabe polyglot, someone who is interested in language acquisition but not particularly in social, historical, or theoretical aspects of linguistics?   Is there any chance I can build a secure, fulfilling career out of this?  Should I change majors before I waste any more time, keeping language learning as a hobby behind a more secure career? What am I getting myself into?

linguistics,Has anyone conclusively shown directionality of sound changes?,"Like have they shown that change of sound X ---&gt; Y is more likely than change of sound Y ---&gt; X in any case?

Another way to phrase this would be to ask if some sounds are more stable than others. If so, and an unstable sound can change to a stable one, then this implies directionality.

Following on from this, I have some other related questions I am curious about:

If so, has anyone proposed a credible biological hypothesis for why that would be the case?

If not, are there any good reasons for believing that this would be the case?

Is this a common assumption in linguistics?

If so, are there any commonly held views in linguistics that are predicated on this assumption?

linguistics,"Old Irish and Ancient Greek most difficult IE languages to learn for an English speaker, claims ""independent"" scholar","Here's the relevant section of a language difficulty analysis based on majority opinion. Levels of difficulty range from easiest or 1 to most difficult of all or 6:

&gt;Classic or Ancient Greek is worse \[than Modern Greek\], with a distinction between aspirated and unaspirated consonants, a pitch accent system and a truly convoluted, insanely irregular system of noun and verb inflection. It has a dual number in addition singular and plural and it has a very difficult optative case. Irregular verbs have one of six different stem types. The grammar is one of the most complex of all languages and the phonology and morphology are truly convoluted. Ancient Greek is said to have had four different genitive cases, but it actually had four different uses of the genitive:  
Objective Genitive - ""for obedience to faith""  
Subjective Genitive - ""faith's obedience"" or faithful obedience  
Attributive Genitive - ""obedience of faith""  
Genitive of Apposition - obedience, i.e. faithHow confusing! Classic Greek gets a **5.5 rating**, nearly hardest of all to learn.

linguistics,Tone vs Pitch,"Hi all, I recently started reading up and toying with the Swedish language and have discovered it's pitches. Doing further research, I can't seem to grasp why pitches are different than tones, other than the fact that the pitches in Swedish occupy more than one syllable. 

[This is what I found from a Berkeley Ph.D:](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-a-tonal-language-and-a-pitch-accent-language)

"" Pitch accent languages (such as Japanese) \[as opposed to tones\], encode height -- usually low vs high -- onto syllables. For instance, the word hashi is made up of two syllables and whether you say the first syllable in a low pitch and the second in a high pitch, ie. LH, or the reverse, HL, the meaning of the word will change. It's the contrast in the height of the syllables that matters.""

So, how is the 'height' aspect of pitches different than tones? How is the tone of the Chinese word  **少** (shǎo)  different than the pitch of the Swedish word *Ankan* (with second pitch pronounced ánkàn) {aside from the fact that the chinese word is falling rising and the Swedish word would be rising falling}? 

Pitch equally encodes meaning into the word; Ankan with a 'neutral' tone (pitch 1) is a different word than Ankan with a 'rising falling' tone (pitch 2)",1591568231,Cultural-Cantaloupe,10

linguistics,"Phonemes of ""seagull"" vs. ""Siegel"" in American English?","I'm trying to figure out the phonemic side of syllabic-L in American English.  Many authors analyze syllabic-L as /ʌl/, but I'm having a hard time applying that concept here:

""seagull"" \[ˈsi.gʌl\] vs. ""Siegel"" \[ˈsi.gl̩\]

What's the underlying phonemic sequence here?  (For context, ""Siegel"" rhymes with words like ""beagle"" or ""regal"".)

Intuitively, it feels like ""seagull"" has \[ʌl\] because of its origins as a compound word.  But that's an etymological explanation that shouldn't be required to understand the pronunciation of this word.  Plenty of people learn the word ""seagull"" long before they would encounter ""gull"" independently.

How the sequence /ʌl/ is pronounced, that is, whether it maps to \[ʌl\] or \[l̩\], should depend on something in the phonemic structure of the word.  I'm hesitant to say secondary stress is phonemic in English, but it feels like it's either that, or syllabic-L is phonemic.

(q1) As for sentence A, I feel like this is at the knife's edge of being insulting, like if we interpret my intention to be the can of 'ability', it's an insult? But if it's possibility, it isn't insulting because it's just a representational description of the state of affairs?

(q2) As for sentences A and A2, A2 is a reflexive, but is A a reflexive too? Is it syntactically transitive but semantically reflexive? (same question for sentence pair (B) and (B2))

(q3) As for sentence C2, does sentence C2 convey the same meaning as (C)?

(q4) If C and C2 mean the same thing, then I'm not too clear on what exactly is the accurate way to describe the relationship between the self and the brain that one has, other than to say that the brain is something that 'someone' has, and that that 'someone' is not the brain. I mean it just seems to get pretty Bhuddist pretty quick with sentence C2. or am i just making stuff up?

(q5) Do sentences D to F sound kinda petty because they have the word 'because' in them? Would it be friendlier if they were just two separate non-conjoined sentences?  


(q6) I keep reading sentence C3 as non-reflexive transitive. Does anyone else read it that way?  


(q7) C4 just feels ungrammatical to me, but is this sense of ungrammaticality just a religious thing because I'm bhuddist?

linguistics,Cameroonian (Central-African) French differences with Parisian French,"Most people, when they think of french dialects/accents *(not including creoles)*, think about the various dialects existing in Europe *(France, Switzerland, Walloonia,...)* or the dialects existing on the american continent like *(Quebec, Acadia, louisiana,...)* but often seem to forget the african varieties of french which are become more and more widely spoken as the population of these african countries increase.

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, most people have little to no idea of how these african dialects of french sound like and how they differantiate depending on the social class one has. That's why I wan't to dedicate a post to one of these varieties which I will call **cameroonian french** or **CF** for short. My goal is to annalyse the dialect and show the differences it has with **parisian french** or **PF**.

Here are some videos where in the first one someone who speaks in the accent while talking about his experience with the coronavirus treatment and in the second one it's an interview of a comedian

**links (COVID treatment):** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfb8nzv-nrE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfb8nzv-nrE)

**Link (interview comedian):** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvtmmMmzBgg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvtmmMmzBgg)

&amp;#x200B;

**Phonology**

The thing I find most interesting about the accent is that it has more similarities with the southern french accents than the parisian one and that it's more reflective of how standard french is written, despite many *(porbably the majority)* of the speakers not being native speakers, even though french is widely spoken as a native language by the youth and in the big cities like Douala and Yaoundé, french has already become a native language to many.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Elision:** in **CF,** the schwa sound /ə/ is not elided as often as in Parisian French. For example the word *""enchainement""* which would be pronounced as *""enchainmen""* (following french phonetic rules and spelling) in **PF** would be pronounced as *""enchainemen""* in **CF**. Another example is that *""maintenant""* which would be pronounced as *""maintnan""* in **PF** would be pronounced as *""maintenan""* in **CF**. *""Franchement""* which would be pronounced as *""franchmen""* in PF is pronounced as *""franchemen""* etc.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Nasal vowels:** nasal vowels which ocur at the last sylable in a word often get denasalised in **CM,** so ""quand"" becomes quang, ""moment"" becomes ""momeng"" (most endings in ""ment"" become ""meng"")

&amp;#x200B;

* **The ""R"" Sound:** The *""R""* sound varies greatly in **CF** depending on the speaker. In **PF**, all *""R""* are pronounced and gutteral whereas in **CM**, most *""R""* at the end of a sylable aren't pronounced. So *""sur""* in **PF** becomes *""su""* in **CM**; *""savoir""* in **PF** becomes *""savoi""* in **CM**; *""toujour""* in **PF** becomes *""toujou""* in \*\*CM; ""\*\*dire"" becomes *""di""; ""comportement""* which is pronounced as *""comportemen""* in **PF** becomes *""compotemen""* in **CF** etc.
* Furthermore, the *""R""* that do get pronounced vary in pronunciation depending on the speaker, some might pronounce it as an aviolar trill, others as an alveolar tap (just like in spanish), while others may pronounce as a gutteral sound as in **PF**.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Stress:** In **PF**,  grammatical stress is always on the final full syllable (syllable with a vowel other than schwa) of a word while in **CM** the stress is mostly put on the penultimate syllable due to the schwa sounds being pronounced. (the stress will be highlighted) So *""uniquement""* which would be pronounced as *""uniq****men***\*""\* in **PF** would be pronounced as ""uni**que**men"" in **CF**; *""étouffement""* which would be pronounced as *""étouff****men***\*""\* in **PF** would be pronounced as *""étouf****fe****men""* in **CM** etc. Sometimes, the stress is put elsewhere than the penultimate syllable in CM. So ""verbalement"" pronounced as 'verbal**men**"" in PF would be pronounced as ""**ver**balemen"" etc

&amp;#x200B;

* **Liaison:** Both varieties still use liaisons in the same circumstances

&amp;#x200B;

* Some words simply get pronounced differently. For example ""jamais"" and ""vingt"" which would be pronounced as ""Jamai""and ""vin(t)"" in PF can sometimes be pronounced as ""jamain"" and ""vung"" respectivelly, though it isn't always pronounced that way and depends on the speaker.

&amp;#x200B;

**Grammar:** In PF, the distinction between ""on"" and ""nous"" has been slightly lost due to ""on"" taking on the meaning of ""nous"" in informal speech while nous is being preserved in formal speech or for emphasis. For example in PF they might say ""on va nager"" and to add emphesis they'll say ""Nous, on va nager"" to make it clear that ""we"" are doing the action while ""nous allons nager"" is mostly used in formal speech

This is different from CM where the distinction between ""on"" and ""nous"" has been preserved so there's no difference between informal and formal speech in that regard. So the phrase ""we are going to swim"" becomes ""nous allons nager"" in informal and formal speech"" while ""on va nager"" strictly means that a general amount of people are going to swim.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vocabulary and Expressions**

Instead of saying ""bonjour"" like in PF, many people might say ""Bonne arrivé""

instead of saying  \*\*""\*\*en 2020"" like in PF, many people might say ""à l'an 2020""

there are also a ton of vocabulary differences and new words depending on the country but most of the words can be found on the internet so i won't bother putting them all on this post.

linguistics,Should I switch to a linguistics/language major?,"Hello, I posted this on r/language but no one got around to answer it:


I think languages have always been my best subject. I loved taking Mandarin in middle school, and when I wasn’t able to take Mandarin online in high school, I took Spanish instead and ended up excelling at it as well. I was considering taking linguistics as my major for a long time, but a huge setback for me was that I’m not a very good writer. I’ve always struggled in writing essays and I’m not that great with words in general. I knew that if I were to major in linguistics or any language major, it would most likely involve a lot of extensive writing, vocabulary, and discussion. 

Right now, I am an incoming college freshman and I plan to major in Earth Sciences because I feel like I’m half-decent in physical sciences and the topic interests me.

linguistics,"Usage of ""gotten"" in UK English","I was watching the show *Quiz* (about the cheating scandal on UK's version of *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?*) and there was a scene where one of the main characters' daughters plays a very short passage on the piano and then says, ""That's all I've got.""

This seemed like a very deliberate choice by the writers, but I can't figure out why. 

It doesn't seem like it would be a dialectal thing, because why would a young child speak a different dialect than her two siblings?

Also, I was under the impression that ""gotten"" is rather rare and disfavored in the UK. Furthermore, even in the US where ""gotten"" is popular, a speaker would still use ""got"" in that particular phrase.

I was wondering if anyone here has studied Proto-Bulgarian or  Slavic languages and Indian languages, who could tell us a bit more about how the various languages have evolved and the similarities and differences between them from a linguistics point of view - or point us to some resources that could help us discover more?

linguistics,An interesting thing in Swiss German I only just noticed,"Swiss German is my first and main language, but I only just noticed this now in my 30s. 😶

In Swiss German, especially in the west, it's common to invite the conversation partner to agree to or confirm something, which is done by attaching "", gäll?"" (/gælː/) at the end of the sentence you want your conversation partner to concur with. Very similar to adding "", right?"" to an English sentence.

However, for some reason this equivalent to ""right?"" is treated as though it were a verb in informal 2nd person singular imperative and thus needs to be changed when politeness comes into the picture (to what looks like polite 2nd person singular imperative/interrogative): ""gälled Sie?"" (/ɡæləd si/)

Compare ""bäll"" (""bark!""), ""bällsch?"" (do you bark?), ""bälled Sie(?)"" (bark! (polite) / do You bark?). Doesn't work 100% because the /l/ stays geminated here. /gælɘd si/ is an outlier in that regard, but that's probably because of heavy use.",1591093552,curiosityLynx,85

linguistics,(Semi)functioning allative in English?,"My dad showed me a twitter thread where someone asked if suffixing -ward(s) on to a noun to mean ""motion towards x"" (upward, forward, heavenward, homeward) is a functioning allative. Is it?

I guess it's kinda fossilized, I wouldn't really think of using it interchangeably with 'towards', but it wouldn't sound too unnatural to do so, just kinda old fashioned. 

If anything, it gives it an even more general feel; ""he's going towards the edge"" sounds a lot more definite than ""he's going edgeward""

But there's a lot words with a -ward suffix that I never really thought of as meaning ""motion towards X"", forwards, backwards, downwards, upwards, northward, eastward, etc.",1591048563,Pharmacysnout,41
linguistics,What are your thoughts on these possible changes to English spelling to make it phonetic.,"Remove the letter C and just spell words with K or S

Replace the CH with the international letter ʧ for the same sound

Replace the SH with the international letter ʂ for the same sound

Replace OO as in Tattoo Tattu and OO as in Shoot with shute

Spell words with the letters that make the sound and remove silent letters like for example, Neighbor as Nabor or Night/Knight as Nite

Formally using ă, ĕ, ĭ, ŏ, ŭ for soft sounds and ā, ē, ī, ō, ū for the name of the voul.

Our weekly Q&amp;A thread is the perfect place to post them! A new Q&amp;A thread goes up every Monday, but we have people who read them regularly throughout the week.

**What counts as a “quick question”?**

Any question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: 

*Quick questions:*

* Asking for an explanation of a technical term
* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature
* Asking how we would transcribe something
* Asking how a feature works in a particular language

*Not-so-quick questions:*

* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

Also, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search.

linguistics,Vowel Quality Of Classical Latin's Nasalized Vowels,"So, English's Wikipedia page for [Latin phonology and orthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_phonology_and_orthography#Vowel_nasalization) claims that nasalized vowel quality is the same as the long vowels (and they're also long). However, Wiktionary disagrees and gives the pronunciation of /um/ as \[ʊ̃ˑ\], a half-long nasalized vowel, with the quality of a short /u/.

Wikipedia claims ""monstrum"" was pronounced: \[ˈmõː.strũː\], [Wiktionary, on the other hand, claims it was](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/monstrum#Latin) \[ˈmõː.strʊ̃ˑ\]. While they agree on the first vowel, they disagree on the second.

If you think of Romance Languages, Wiktionary's reconstruction makes more sense, because, in theory, Romance Languages merged nasalized vowels with plain oral vowels, and latter merged /ʊ/ and /oː/ into /o/. We also know that Romance masculine nouns singular were derived from the accusative, ending in /-um/. If the underlying vowel quality of /um/ was \[ũː\], we would have words like \**gatu* instead of *gato* (cat), \**pelu* instead of *pelo* (hair) in Spanish. If it was \[ʊ̃ˑ\], we end up with *gato* and *pelo*. So, \[ʊ̃ˑ\] sounds better?

Does this make sense? Is \[ʊ̃ˑ\] a better recostruction than \[ũː\]?",1590977030,pinhaonachapa,12

linguistics,Do any aspects of English reveal that it was developed on an island nation?,"I am a native English speaker who is currently studying other European languages on Duolingo.

In general, I've discovered as a pattern something that I find ironic: English seems to have influenced mainland European languages (particularly the Category I languages, i.e. the Romance languages, the Scandinavian languages, and the Germanic languages) much more than the other way around. You'd think that, with Britain being so remote and isolated from the rest of Europe except by water, that the English language would be lacking words for many things that other cultures have a concept of.

Instead, English has the richest vocabulary of any language in the world. I'm not seeing any hint of the European countries on the mainland thinking ""the British are so backward and underdeveloped as a result of being so far away."" If anything, it seems that French, Spanish, German, Norwegian, etc. borrow a lot of loan words from English.

Of course I'm biased and might be missing something because English is my native language. But do any aspects of the English language drop hints here and there that it actually was developed on an island, not in one of the integrated continental European countries mentioned above? Several aspects of English seem absent in the other European languages I know: ""to"" in the infinitive form of every verb, ""do"" for verbs expressed in the negative (and positive for emphasis), and any accent marks aside from loan words.

linguistics,"Interesting usages of ""the"", ""of"", and ""s as possessive"" in the English language"," 

First off, English is not my native language. My native language is Brazilian Portuguese. If you are interested in learning Portuguese or know(ing) more about my language, just let me know.

Well, the use of the article ""the"" is quite challenging for those who are learning English as a second language.

I've noticed that some countries require the use of ""the"", e.g.: **The** United Stated of America; **The** Netherlands; **The** United Kingdom, etc.

For example:

* ""What's that? It's **USA** team. It's **the USA** team. It's **(the) UK team**.

Some countries don't require ""the"", e.g.: Brazil; Portugal ; Australia, etc.

For example:

* ""What's that? It's Brazil team. It's the Australia team. (it is interesting that maybe I can say It's the Brazilian team. It's the Australian team.)

Another interesting thing is the use of **&lt;of&gt;** vs **&lt;'s&gt;**.

Is it possible to say: **The** United State\*\*'s\*\* America? Or United State\*\*'s\*\* America? (without ""the"")

Why the word ""States"" comes before America? Could it be ""America\*\*'s\*\* states""? or even ""America\*\*'s\*\* states united""? America states\*\*'\*\* united?

Still speaking of **&lt;'s&gt;** and **&lt;of&gt;**, are the following sentences correct?

HUSBAND = **X** ; DEMI MOORE = **Y**

a) **The** *husband* **of** Demi Moore; The + **x** \+ of + **y**

b) Demi Moore\*\*'s\*\* *husband*; **y** \+ 's + **x**

c) **The** Demi Moore\*\*'s\*\* *husband*; The + **y** \+ 's + **x**

d) *Husband* **of** Demi Moore; **x** \+ of + **y**

e) Demi Moore **of** *Husband*; **y** \+ of + **x**

f) *Husband*\*\*'s\*\* Demi Moore; **x** \+ 's + **y**

g) **The** Demi Moore **of** *husband*; The + **y** \+ of + **x**

h) **The** *Husband*\*\*'s\*\* Demi Moore; The + **x** \+ 's + **y**

I believe that ""a"" and ""b"" are correct. What's your opinion? Why I cannot say ""&lt;The&gt; Demi Moore's ...""?

What's the role of the article ""the"" in some of the sentences shown?

If Demi Moore in the sentence is a ""name""; then, why I say ""The Simpsons; The Smiths; etc?

Standard Korean has no real native word for ""deity,"" using only Sino-Korean words or neologisms. But its virtually extinct sister language, Jeju, appears to. This is 도 *do*.

Dictionaries sometimes describe this as a suffix for divine names, because the word no longer appears in isolation, but the examples below with the genitive particle strongly suggest that this used to be an independent word:

* 궤네깃도 *Gwenegi-t-do*

Gwenegi-t-do is the name of the patron deity of a village called Gwenegi, and *-t* (underlying -s) is a genitive particle. The name of the god is ""the *do* of Gwenegi"".

* 하로산또 *Haro-san-tto*

Haro-san-tto is the name of the patron deity of Mount Halla, the largest mountain in Jeju Island. Another clear etymology: *Haro* is the name of the mountain, and *san* is Sino-Korean for ""mountain."" The orthography obscures the genitive particle, but underlying VsdV is realized as VttV in Korean. So we have the genitive particle here and this is actually ""the *do* of Mount Halla"".

* 일뤠또 *Illwe-tto*

Same as above, this is actually underlying *illwe-s-do*. *Illwe* is ""seventh day,"" so this is ""the *do* of the seventh day."" This deity was worshiped on the seventh, seventeenth, and twenty-seventh days of the month.

Examples of *do* used in something other than theonyms, though it's not as obvious as above:

* 베포도업침 *Bepo-do-eop-chim*

This is a Jeju ritual where the deeds of the creator gods are recited. 業 업 *eop* is Sino-Korean for ""work; merit; deed; karma,"" and *chim* is the nominalized form of the verb *chida* ""to strike.""

This leaves 베포도 *bepo-do*, which is harder to segment. But *bepo* might be an irregular form of Sino-Korean 配布 *baepo* ""to distribute"" (no other word is similar to *bepo* in either Jeju or Korean).

So we have ""striking on [reciting?] the deeds of the distributing *do*,"" which sounds similar to what the ritual does.

* 불도맞이 *bul-do-maji*

This is a ceremony held for the goddess of childbirth.

*Maji* is ""meeting; greeting,"" so we have ""greeting the *bul-do*."" As for *bul*, the morpheme is attested only in the Middle Korean compound noun *pwul-alh* (Revised Romanization *bul-alh*) ""testicle.""^1 Since *alh* is ""egg,"" *pwul* might mean something like ""fertility"" or ""sex""^2 (""sex egg"" &gt; ""testicle"").

So we seem to have ""greeting the fertility *do*"" or ""greeting the sexual *do*.""

So it's pretty clear that Jeju used to have *do* ""god; deity; divinity,"" which seems very unlikely to be from Chinese.

Is there any neighboring language family (Japonic especially, but also Nivkh or Ainu or what-have-you) with a similar morpheme?

***

^1 Modern Korean *bul* ""fire"" had a different form in Middle Korean and cannot be related.

^2 Although ""to have sex"" is normally unrelated *el-* in Middle Korean.",1590855014,Nur-e-Aftab,12

linguistics,What are the chances that mayonnaise salads (like pasta/potato/tuna salads) come from the idea of salting foods to keep from spoilage?,"Salad comes from the Latin word meaning salted. From etymonline:

&gt; from Old French salade (14c.), from Vulgar Latin *salata, literally ""salted,""

In my searching I found this on Wikipedia about mayonnaise:

&gt; In fact, the earliest known French recipes of [mayonnaise] appear to be recipes for an aspic, not a sauce: Viard's 1806 recipe for ""poulets en mayonnaise"" describes a sauce involving a velouté, gelatin, vinegar, and an optional egg to thicken it, which gels like an aspic.

Aspic of course is known as the gelatin which in the 1800s and early 1900s was a base to cook your food in so that the food could be preserved longer since it has less contact with air while encased in gelatin. 

So what are the chances that since aspic and salt were both used as food preservatives, the word “salted” or “salad” was somehow adopted as slang for preserving food? And along the line, preserving food with aspic became known as a salad because of that? And further down that line somebody perhaps got tired of aspic alone,  made an aspic into a creamy sauce with vinegar and egg (as seen above) and created mayonnaise, mixed that with food like pasta/potatoes/tuna and still called it salad? 

What are the chances that mayonnaise salads are a result of the evolution of preserving foods from spoilage?",1590785411,GraffitiJones,1

What I'm asking is...

Theoretically, in an equative copula sentence involving two nouns, either noun can be definite or indefinite, giving four possibilities:

1. def subject + def predicate : *The toddler is the criminal mastermind*
2. def subject + indef predicate : *The toddler is a criminal mastermind*
3. indef subject + def predicate : *A toddler is the criminal mastermind*
4. indef subject + indef predicate : *A toddler is a criminal mastermind*

Am I right that 3 sounds slightly off/unusual and that this would typically be reworded as *The criminal mastermind is a toddler* i.e. 2 def subject + indef predicate? Is this because of some kind of ""definiteness hierarchy"" where we don't like the subject to be ""less definite"" than the predicate?

linguistics,"I would like an unbiased explanation of ""should of""","It fascinates and kind of terrifies me how the expression *should of* or its siblings *could of* and *would o*f causes intense rage on the internet. The knee jerk reaction to this expression is to assume that it's a spelling error, but that is just an assumption, and I'm pretty sure *should of* is something I've heard people say in **real life,** anyone else? 

It seems strange to me that people would unwittingly write *of* instead of *'ve* because *should've* doesn't even sound like *should of* and *should've* is something you're taught when you first learn to read. Isn't *should of* just a dialect thing? I would like to know which dialects tend to say *should of* and which say *should have*, if it's more than a spelling error like I expect. 

It's impossible to find any neutral descriptions on the internet, the phrase is always accompanied with intense fury towards people who say it and there doesn't really seem to be any question about whether it's really a mistake.

I would really love to get my hands on some literature on Korean linguistic relativity and on comparing Korean and Western world views and how they have an affect on each language.  

One thing I had always noticed was that Korean favors describing background information first, whereas English will always put the person first. Of course this may just be because of the sentence word order, but I always wondered if it's also due to the fact that Koreans tend to pay more attention to their surrounding environment (in keeping up with nunchi) that their Western counterparts.

Luzon and some of the Lumad tribes in Mindanao as well as some Aeta groups) have F's and V's sounds at least in part.

linguistics,Question about V2 Word Order,"I am Dutch and, according to Wikipedia, Dutch and German word order is not simply SVO in main clauses, but actually something called ""V2 word order"". Meaning that the verb always comes as the 2nd clause in a sentence, for example you  can say ""I walk tomorrow"" and also ""Tomorrow walk I"".  

However, when I searched for this phenomenon with Dutch sources, they simply say that Dutch uses SVO and that when you place something else at the start of the sentence an inversion occurs  with the subject and the verb.  I would say this theory is a bit more elegant as with questions you also do this inversion, e.g to make ""I walk tomorrow"" a question you make it ""Walk I tomorrow?"".

An argument for V2 this is that combined verbs like ""weg-gaan"" get broken up: it's ""ik ga weg"" instead of ""ik wegga"" wich means ""I go away"". Because otherwise it would be breaking the V2 rule according to Wikipedia. (I say Wikipedia because this is the only source of this argument and it gives no references) Personally I find this argument a bit weak, because there is actually a large group of combined verbs that are impossible to split, e.g. ""vergaan"" becomes ""ik ver ga"", meaning ""I perish"".

Maybe it’s not quite that because it’s not as pronounced as it is in Southern accents, but everyone in California seemed to be allergic to the letter “E.” For example words I hear where “enter” pronounced as “inter”; “Denver” pronounced as “Dinver”; Jennifer pronounced as “Jinnifer.” It was bizarre to hear because even East Coast speakers with mostly General American accents (such as in Connecticut or Pennsylvania) certainly do not pronounce “enter” and “inter” the same.

I’ve read that the pen/pin merger only affects a small area of south-central California, but is there any evidence it’s more widespread? The Kardashians, also natives of LA, also exhibit the merger to a degree. You would never hear it merged in any way in the northeast, so I’m curious.",1590379682,snowluvr26,7

linguistics,"Many ancient Indo-European languages seem to have had a much simpler syllable structure than reconstructed PIE, with fewer complex consonant clusters. Is it really plausible that PIE was so phonologically distinct from (most of?) its early daughter languages?","Looking at early Indo-European languages (Latin, Ancient Greek, Sanskrit) as well as some of the reconstructed proto-languages descended from PIE (Proto-Germanic, Proto-Celtic), they all seem to have had a somewhat simpler syllable structure than what is generally given for PIE. I haven't actually come across a source that spells this out, so perhaps my judgement is just flat out wrong here. But it does seem, looking through cognate lists for example, that PIE is full of consonant clusters that just don't show up in the daughter languages. Of course, cluster simplification is a common process that happens all the time, but when I took historical linguistics in undergrad it was drilled into us to avoid reconstructing a feature in a proto-language that doesn't show up in any of the daughters —unless you really, really have to. And I guess I assume that's the answer, that there's just no way to explain the various correspondences otherwise. Still, from the perspective of a layman who has never formally studied IE linguistics, it's always seemed slightly implausible that PIE is so much more consonant-y than the early attested IE languages are.

linguistics,Pronouncing unfamiliar phonemes &amp; types of vernacular,"Two questions that got my interest were:

1. A friend of mine mentioned that whenever he would run into an unfamiliar phoneme, he would try to find an approximate 'consonant diphtong' (if there is such a thing). For example, for the *voiceless palatal fricative* (German 'ch'), he combined the *voiceless glottal fricative* (h) and the *voiced palatal approximant* (j). Is there any theory that explains how this works? I have seen other examples but can't remember them at the moment. My theory was that you would use one consonant each from the row and column in the sound chart (manner of articulation x place of articulation). Does phonation matter?
2. Are there classifications of vernaculars or everyday language? I noticed that for English, *typically* only pronunciation and vocabulary might change between vernaculars, but grammar is still respected, but not in some other languages.

Sorry if the questions were long or stupid. Not a linguist so I might have gotten things wrong, but the field interests me a lot. Lastly, does anyone have any recommendation on beginner books on linguistics. I would love to read one that covered the basics in an understansable manner.

linguistics,Thought experiment: How to grow up knowing all the sounds by learning the fewest languages," Let's say there's a pair of parents that are hardcore linguaphiles, met and fell in love studying languages, and have spent their lives becoming hyperpolyglots together. They want their children to be hyperpolyglots too but can't teach them all the languages all at once. 

Rather, they think their best shot is to to maximize their children's ability to hear, recognize, distinguish between, and eventually produce the greatest variety of useful sounds possible before their sensitive period is over. This would be accomplished by strategically teaching them 3-6 languages. 

The idea is this would in theory allow them to overcome problems with learning and speaking other languages because they already use a very wide range of sounds. The best possible outcome would be their children spending almost zero time learning to hear or pronounce phonemes from their next language, and they sound near-fluent from the get go.

linguistics,Non-specific Plurals in languages with Complex Plural Forms?,"I'm a software developer, and I'm trying to ensure my application is as translatable as possible, but I've come across an issue and can't find an answer, hoping someone here might have some advice.

As [different languages have different rules for pluralization](https://unicode-org.github.io/cldr-staging/charts/37/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html), with some of them being relatively complex, it's fairly standard for translation toolkits to let you provide a number as context. For example, the string used in code might be ""You have {n} new message(s)"", and the system could produce ""You have 5 new messages"" or ""You have 1 new message"", and those systems can accurately handle languages with more plural forms.

The problem I'm having is that sometimes I don't have a specific number of objects to give to the translation system. For example, I might have a heading somewhere that says ""Layers"", which will have some variable number of layers under it. In English this is easy enough, as the one plural covers any number larger than 1. But I'm not sure what the correct translation would be here in a language with several plural forms. In addition, I have absolutely no idea how to correctly achieve it when my only option is passing in a specific number for the translation.

Very interested in hearing any of the following:

- From native/fluent speakers of languages with complex plurals: how would you translate this, and what does software you use do?
- From general linguists: across different languages, is there something considered 'standard' in this case?
- From people with experience in software translation: have you hit this issue, and how did/would you react to it?",1590147868,TheOldTubaroo,13

Again the b comes in handy in the German language instead of v. 


3-""striving"" in English vs ""streben"" in German (DE) 

More examples of this weird phenomenon in German :


-""love"" EN vs ""liebe"" DE
-""giving"" EN vs ""geben"" DE
-""having"" EN vs ""haben"" DE
-""over"" EN vs ""über"" DE
And almost hundreds more examples, these were just the ones that I have in mind right now, of course all word comparisons have the same meaning for both words. 
there's also the weird relationship between p and f in the European languages too, like:

-""for"" in English, ""pour"" in French 
-""sleep"" in English vs ""schlaf"" in German 
-""pepper"" EN vs ""Pfeffer"" DE
-""apple"" EN vs ""Apfel"" DE

You notice that weird p and f relationships in seemingly close words letterwise, so my question is, is there some sort of old English explanation or an old Roman language effect?",1590147047,MMahh,7
linguistics,"Is the English love for diphthongs caused by ""too short"" words?","One thing I have noticed is that English people love to ou and ay things. Sochi becomes souchi or souchi etc.

go is gou etc.

This is weird. In my language we tend to do the opposite because ie, ie,iu, ô makes things longer, so, in a daily talk we shorten things like nie to ne, môj (muoj) to moj etc.

In English it't the opposite. 

It's weird, but when I look at English I see a ton of short words and perhaps this love for diphthongs is one way how to ""prolong"" words and put more emotions in them.

What do studies and research say about the English love of diphthongs? Or it hasn't been studied much yet?

Is there any famous linguist or group of people who studies this phenomenon?",1590142315,lacostanosta,5

linguistics,Different schwa sounds,"I'm a Brazilian studying English and in my native language there is no schwa, or at least it's very rare. So Portuguese speakers tend to pronounce the letter that produces the schwa sound in the same way that letter would be pronounced in Portuguese.

For example, we tend to pronounce the 'o' (schwa) in 'computer' as the 'o' in 'coincidence'. Although this case is okay for me and I do get the use of schwa in this case, I feel that I hear different sounds between the 'u' in 'cut' and the final 'e' in 'development', even though both are the schwa.

The 'u' in 'cut' for me is pretty much like the short u sound, while the 'e' in 'development' sounds more or less like the 'e' in 'envy' for example. As they are the same sound, they shouldn't sound different, so what's the matter? 

Obs.: I know this question may seem weird for native speakers, as I'm describing from the perspective of a non-native speaker, specially from a language that doesn't use schwas. I would like to hear insights anyway.",1590129678,enzohn,11

I've tried to look for some theoretical treatment of it in google, but either it doesn't exist or is way below all the papers on pragmatics whose text use that phrase.

Is there a discourse pragmatics framework that captures the use of this and similar expressions? Has someone attempted a usage and/or semantics classification? I know that frameworks to describe discourse adverbs/particles/markers are a hot topic, but they don't seem to accomodate phrase-like units.

*Makes sense* seems to be used for everything from ""That's possible"" to ""I think you've nailed it"", and the negatives *It makes no sense* and *It doesn't make sense* are a whole separate can of worms. They seem to approach evaluative adverbs like *probably, absolutely* that constitute separate speech acts, or even interjections, but also seem to be propositions at the same time in that *makes no sense* = ""I disagree"" could conceivably be the negative of *makes sense* = ""I agree"", and in turn can be modified  with subjective modal adverbs, as in *makes sense, I guess*. A pun like *Makes sense, except that it doesn't* = ""I see what you're saying, except that it's absurd"" indicates that there's at least two pragmatically distinct entities. One of these entities might or might not be the clearly propositional *It makes sense that A/to A,* which the pragmatically specialised use originated from.

&gt;**2 … History of Irish in Mayo**  
&gt;  
&gt;While the Irish language lives on today in County Mayo, I have come to the conclusion that its history may effectively be split up into two parts with the mid-19th century Famine being the starting point of the second part. This is due to the devastating effects the Famine had on Irish society, but more importantly as it marked the beginning of the decline of Irish in Mayo and across Ireland.  
&gt;  
&gt;While the tale of the first people of Ireland is one that has been long lost, those of us who live here today are mostly descended from the Celtic settlers of Britain’s late Iron age around 500 BC. The Irish language, which is itself of course Celtic, is descendent from the original Proto-Celtic and has evolved and changed shape over the last several thousand years.  
&gt;  
&gt;While the jury is still out on whether or not there were people in Ireland before the Celts, we know for a fact that Irish had upheld its status until dates varying between 1800 and around the 1850s depending on the location.  
&gt;  
&gt;Using the 1901 census, I was able to make a chart below which shows populations determined by age (give or take \~5 years) and then the number of Irish speakers (bilingual and monolingual) with the overall percentage of Irish native speakers.  
&gt;  
&gt;**📷**  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*Figure 1 shows data collected from the National Archives*  
&gt;  
&gt;From Figure 1, we can see that whilst older generations remain nearly entirely Irish speaking while there is an identifiable transition period among the youngest generation where it is clear that English (a language that the majority of people were familiar with anyways) quickly became the home language across the county.  
&gt;  
&gt;Figure 2 shows data collected from the 1911 census. It shows the percentage of those aged 60+ whose mother tongue is Irish. When we compare this with Figure 3, which shows official Gaeltacht areas in 1926, a visible loss is present particularly around the townlands of Ballina, Castlebar, Westport, Claremorris, Louisburgh and Charlestown (all of which are shown on Figure 4).  
&gt;  
&gt;**📷**  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*Figure 2 shows the percentage of those over 60 whose native language is Irish. Courtesy to Garret Fitzgerald*  
&gt;  
&gt;**📷**  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*Figure 3 shows the areas in 1926 that would have or did qualify for Gaeltacht status according to the first Comisiún na Gaeltachta/Gaeltacht Commission.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*📷*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Figure 4 shows the townlands of Ballina, Castlebar, Westport, Claremorris, Louisburgh and Charlestown. These were areas where the Irish language had been quickly eroded.*  
&gt;  
&gt;In 1922, with the establishment of the Irish Free State, the Irish language saw its first chance at revitalisation. This was the goal for many proponents of the Gaelic Revival and as a result, many Irish schools and Summer Colleges were established across the country. While this may sound like a step in the right direction, experts in the field of Language Revitalisation like Joshua Fishman would tell us that this was a critical time for the Irish language as the oldest and last speakers from communities across Ireland, as well as the Isle of Mann and Scotland, were dying in waves. The schools, Summer colleges and minor government action did little to address this and with the lack of Gaeltacht areas in counties such as Cavan, Roscommon, Kilkenny and Limerick today, it is clear that governmental and local efforts failed to preserve Irish even in communities with substantial amounts of elderly speakers already present. Of course this was true for County Mayo, and when we compare maps and linguistic atlases from across the years we can see a steady shrinkage in Irish speaking areas. See Figure 6 to understand fully the decline over 30 years between 1926 and 1956.  
&gt;  
&gt;This long chain of events and gradual decline has not stopped and continues to this very moment with issues such as parents not rearing children through Irish, poorly qualified teachers who have not properly acquired the natural language (either local dialect or an Caighdeán Oifigiúil) and lack of quality media which all contribute to the current status of Irish today.  
&gt;  
&gt;**📷**  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**📷**  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*Figure 5 shows counties with native Irish speakers in 2020, 1922 and counties that likely had native Irish speakers in 1922. Note that there is a Gaeltacht in County Meath, however this has come about as a result of migration from Connemara.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**📷**  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*Figure 6 compares official Gaeltacht areas between 1926 and 1956. This shows the serious decline and destruction of many Gaeltacht areas. After the Gaeltacht Bill of 1956 was passed, Mayo retained only Gaeltacht status in most of Erris (Iorras), the Mullet Peninsula (an Mhuirthead), Tourmakeedy (Tuar Mhic Éadaigh) and surrounding areas, the Eastern part of Achill Island (Oileán Acla) and the nearby Corraun Peninsula (An Corrán)*  
&gt;  
&gt;**3 … Current Mayo Gaeltacht**  
&gt;  
&gt;With the history of the language in mind, it is no small wonder why Irish remains a community language only in the most isolated parts of Mayo today. While many people in the areas I mentioned above (Erris, Mullet Peninsula, Tourmakeedy, Achill Island and the Corraun Peninsula) use and speak Irish as their own dominant language, communities tend to use English in public domains and have limited use for Irish outside the home. This is not the case for only one area in Erris around Carrowteige (Ceathrú Thaidhg) where several villages and towns use Irish predominantly.  
&gt;  
&gt;Indeed the presence of Irish is well threatened in Mayo, however the language is hardly moribund as while communities may not continuously or consistently use Irish, the language continues to be used in homes and among families.  
&gt;  
&gt;As for actual populations, the Mayo Gaeltacht had a total population of 10,886 people in 2011 making up 11% of Ireland’s Gaeltacht population. As for actual native speakers, there are 6,667 within Mayo, most of whom live in communities where the language is spoken by 30-100% of people.  
&gt;  
&gt;**4 … Dialectal Variation**  
&gt;  
&gt;With the history and and modern description of the Irish language in County Mayo complete, I would like to delve into the part of this project that I enjoyed the most. That is, the linguistic features of “*Mayo Irish*”.  
&gt;  
&gt;Once the word dialect is mentioned in discussions about the Irish language, many of us will be quick to jump to the classic breakdowns of Munster, Connacht and Ulster. However, just like the borders between the provinces, concepts like “Connacht Irish” are somewhat superficial.  
&gt;  
&gt;The groupings do not paint the full picture of Irish dialectology and rather serve as essential collections of related dialects. Even when we break things down further, concepts such as “*Mayo Irish*” or “*Clare Irish*” are inherently flawed due to the different dialects present even within these individual counties  
&gt;  
&gt;With the help of famous Irish dialectologists such as Heinrich Wagner and Erris expert Éamonn Mhac an Fhailigh, I believe that the dialects of Mayo can be effectively split in two, this is shown in Figure 7.  
&gt;  
&gt;In this project, I would like to focus on the more divergent and frankly more iconic dialect which I have labelled as “*North West Connacht Irish*”, for the sake of simplicity I will refer to this as Mayo Irish.   
&gt;  
&gt;**📷**  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*Figure 7 shows the rough border drawn between Mayo’s own “North West Connacht Irish” and the more prevalent “Broad Connacht Irish”*  
&gt;  
&gt;**4.1 … Influences from Neighbouring Regions**  
&gt;  
&gt;Whilst in its most basic form, Mayo Irish is an innately “Connacht” dialect in that it is similar to Connemara Irish and Broad Connacht Irish, it has also received extensive influence from Ulster forms of Irish.  
&gt;  
&gt;As I learned from my history teacher (who is definitely the best history teacher ever), the Plantation of Ulster had a significant effect on the population of the North of Ireland and caused many successive migrations southwards. Several thousands of people migrated from northern counties particularly from Tyrone and Donegal and as a result, the Irish of Mayo has many features very typical of Donegal and still retains a mixture of pronunciation. I will look into that in the next chapter.  
&gt;  
&gt;**5 … Minor Evaluation and Comparison of Dialectal Features**  
&gt;  
&gt;In this chapter I will compare and contrast to the best of my ability the different dialectal quirks of Mayo Irish with other dialects and even Scottish Gaelic. I have attempted to select sentences that accurately display the differences between different dialects.  
&gt;  
&gt;**5.1 … Grammatical Differences from an Caighdeán Oifigiúil**  
&gt;  
&gt;An Caighdeán Oifigiúil (the Caighdeán) serves as the standard form of the Irish language and it is the form that most students study. When faced with real native speakers, the Caighdeán can be difficult to use as a means of communication as it is not a specific dialect that has been chosen or refined but rather a merger between the Gaeltacht varieties which is intended to serve as a bridge between them.  
&gt;  
&gt;With this in mind, it is reasonable to assume that Mayo Irish differs from  the Caighdeán. I believe this to be true and will show how while Mayo Irish is not the most divergent dialect, it does differ extensively.  
&gt;  
&gt;Many of the finer grammatical details are quite different however that is mostly to do with pronunciation and will be dealt with in Chapter 5.2.  
&gt;  
&gt;While the Caighdeán will often vary between using synthetic and analytic forms of verbs, Mayo Irish as well as other Connacht and Ulster varieties prefers analytic forms. For example,“do dhíolas” or “dhíolas” (I sold) are the most common forms in Munster, “dhíol mé” is the preferred term in Mayo. This also extends to other tenses and moods. For example, “bím” (I am -habitual-) is the common term in Munster while “bíonn mé” is used more in Mayo.  
&gt;  
&gt;Prepositions also vary significantly with the mutations often being different. Fore example, in Munster it is common to say “ag an ndoras” (at the door) while in Mayo it is “ag an doras’, words beginning with t and d never receive séimhiú when preceded by a preposition or conjunction. In addition, certain terms may vary in meaning as they combine with other words or are done away with. Also, when followed by the word “sa” meaning in the (singular), words will often receive séimhiú in Scottish Gaelic and Munster “sa bhád” (in the boat), while in Mayo they receive urú “sa mbád”.  
&gt;  
&gt;Plurals are often formed differently than the Caighdeán does as well. For example “scoileanna” (schools) is often “scoileannaí” and “cathracha” (cities) is often “cathrachaí”.  
&gt;  
&gt;The pronoun “sinn” (we) is preferred in the Caighdeán however Mayo Irish usually uses “muid”.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finally, several verbs are changed in Mayo Irish. The verb “déan” (to make) becomes “díon” and “teacht” (verbal noun of to come) becomes “tíocht”.  
&gt;  
&gt;**5.2 … Phonology**  
&gt;  
&gt;Phonology is the way different sounds work within a language and the phonology of Mayo Irish is quite unique when compared with other dialects however it is not as divergent as many of the principles followed in other dialects remain unchanged.  
&gt;  
&gt;Likely the most common example of this is “ch”. This sound is often transformed into “f” in Mayo Irish. For example “chuaigh mé” (I went) becomes “fuaigh mé” and “cluiche” (game) becomes “cluife”.  
&gt;  
&gt;I think the most interesting change is the slender r at the ends of words. In the extinct dialect of County Kilkenny, this sounds was transformed from /ɾʲ/ into /ʒʲ/, a sound similar to the “s” in “measure” or the “j” in French but followed by a “y” sound. This sound shift also occurs in Carrowteige (Ceathrú Thaidhg) and is the subject of debate regarding the correct phonetic transcription. This can be heard at the end of the word “athair” (father) in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP4nXlKJx_4) video at the time 1:47. This sound shift is very unique and only occurs in Mayo Irish today, however dialects in Scottish Gaelic also had unique pronunciations for the infamous slender r.  
&gt;  
&gt;Another interesting change is the vowel in “á”. As with most dialects, this vowel changes and shifts from and while in the Caighdeán this vowel is pronounced /ɑ/ like in the word “bath” in Received Pronunciation. This vowel changes to /ɒ/ which is like /ɑ/ but with the lips rounded in Mayo Irish and it is the only dialect to make this change.  
&gt;  
&gt;Unlike in the Caighdeán and most other dialects, Mayo Irish occasionally distinguished between what are called “the four n’s” and “the four l’s”. These phonemes (/n̪ˠ \~ n̪ʲ \~ nˠ \~ nʲ/, /l̪ˠ \~ l̪ʲ \~ lˠ \~ lʲ/) were treated as separate sounds in Classical Irish however most dialects today have lost the distinction between these sounds apart from the broad slender distinction.  
&gt;  
&gt;Interestingly, many forms of “bí” (to be) differ quite extensively in Mayo Irish. The spellings used are the same however here I will mostly devise my own spelling to accurately represent the sound of the words. In the Caighdeán, the form “bhíodh” (past habitual of bí) is used however the form “bhít” (before sé, sí, sibh and siad) and “bhíamh” (everywhere else) is preferred in Mayo Irish. In the Caighdeán, the form “bheadh” (conditional of bí) is used however the form “bheit” (before sé, sí, sibh and siad) and “bheif” (everywhere else) is preferred in Mayo Irish. In the Caighdeán, the form “rabh” or “robh” (past dependent of bí) is used however the form “rabh” is preferred in Mayo Irish and is commonly used.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now I have finally listed most of the sound changes in Mayo Irish, there are others that do occur however these are mostly random. For example, “muid” (we) is usually pronounced /mˠɪdʲ/ however it is rarely pronounced /mˠɪd͡zʲ/.  
&gt;  
&gt;**6 … Conclusion and Final Notes**  
&gt;  
&gt;As I sit here writing these final words to the project, I believe I have made an accessible and well-rounded overview of the Irish language in the County Mayo. I think that I am happy with the project overall, however I think that if I did it again, I would try and contact a native speaker and ask them to say some of the phrases and words I had listed. Also, I think I would rewrite the grammar section and make it more concise and show more diverse features.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition to coming to the conclusion that Mayo Irish is an interesting dialect, I also want to discuss the difficulty I had obtaining resources, specifically books. Many books written about Irish dialectology were made before the mid-20th century and contain valuable information that is inaccessible elsewhere. Due to copyright laws many of these books have not yet entered the public domain and are only available in physical copies which are frequently sell for upwards of €70 for an individual volume in a series. As a result, the field of Irish dialectology has remained very closed off and information is impossible to track down.

I've been wondering lately: how did right-to-left (RTL) writing systems develop in certain areas?

From a purely mechanical standpoint, it seems really inefficient -- the majority of humans ([90%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness)) are right-handed, so an RTL system means you're pushing characters across the writing medium.  This means that you can't see previous characters and you move your hand to the left, and you run the risk of smearing your writing as you create it (either with ink or with wet clay in earlier times).

By comparison, going left-to-right means you're pulling your hand across the medium.  You can see every previous character as you write the next one, and once you've finished your hand never passes back over existing characters.

To some extent I can understand bi-directional text (e.g., [bustrophedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon)), particularly when the writing is created by means of chisel and stone.  There's no smearing, your angle over the work is such that your hand doesn't block previous characters, and reading bidirectional text is more efficient for the eyes I guess.

Likewise, I get writing top-to-bottom (e.g., Chinese, though even that was read RTL if written vertically) for similar reasons -- it makes more mechanical sense than writing bottom-to-top.

Assuming something super-weird didn't happen like the majority of the human population switching from primarily left-handed to primarily right-handed in the past few thousand years, what would cause RTL to become the norm in a civilization?",1590092619,Pyran,7
linguistics,Cohesion in a text?,"Hey guys, I’m relatively new to linguistics and I don’t quite understand the term “cohesion” in the branch “text linguistics”. 

So, if I’m correct, there are texts and then there are non-texts. Texts have a few criteria that seperate them from non-texts, and one of those criteria is “cohesion”. 

Is it right to say that cohesion consists of rhetorical devices that are supposed to show connections within a text or am I thinking too simply? I’d really appreciate your help!",1590084344,applestrudlee,1

One approach might be a dictionary of diaphonemes - is there one (digital)?  Another might be to use clues.  For example, most words with a postvocalic fricative are in the CLOTH lexical set, while a postvocalic plosive is more likely to be a THOUGHT word (but then there are exceptions like SAUCE).  

Perhaps some would say that if there were, in fact, such heuristics, the lexical set would be merely phonetic and not phonemic.  And yet the sets represent the collective intuition of many speakers grouping similar words together over centuries of phonetic migration.

linguistics,"These are some shared notes I took about how vowel sounds enhance emotion, but I'm just a prose writer with no linguistics training. Accurate? Inaccurate? Anything you'd add or correct?","&gt;I once heard a slam poet talk in an interview about how vowels control pitch, and it took me a while to realize what she meant.    
&gt;  
&gt;Have you noticed that vowels, and by extension words, have bass, midtone, and treble sounds, and their sounds are associated with the feelings we get from them, even when we’re reading them?  We associate them with certain feelings, and maybe even certain colors, and really good lyrical writers often use them to heighten the emotions in the piece’s subject matter.  In fact, part of the reason romance languages, especially french, are considered emotional is because they’re flowy and dominated by vowels.  
&gt;  
&gt;The order of vowels, A-E-I-O-U, seems to descend from high to low.  (Not counting Y, which is a wild card anyway, since it can also be an A, an E, an I, or in Spanish, an LL or a J.)  
&gt;  
&gt;A lot of this depends on pronunciation and accent, but:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- High sounds are generally ones formed in the nose or upper throat and have a trebly quality, e.g., long a’s, as well as the “high a” in cat/rat/bat, long e’s, long i’s, oo sounds—and all the other vowels that are pronounced in those ways.  Words dominated by high vowels tend to sound light, pretty, and airy...  
&gt;  
&gt;*Anastasia, faerie, aria, diva, tingly, scintillating, filigree*  
&gt;  
&gt;...Or silly, informal, goofy, etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Crackalackin, spleen, flibbertigibbet, giggly, yiffy, Tinky-Winky*  
&gt;  
&gt;I think this is the reason why “The Diminutive Y” is an almost omnipresent cultural trope.  (Adding -y or -ie to nouns or names to make them sound cuter.  “Jack &gt; Jackie,” “mom &gt; mommy,” “Bill &gt; Billy,” etc.)  Australians tend to do the same thing with A’s.  “Jess &gt; Jezza” “McDonald’s &gt; Macca’s”  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Low vowels generally come from the lower throat or diaphragm, like long and short o’s, short u’s, and sometimes, short e’s, and can inherently sound darker or more powerful.  
*Hollow, fog, thunder, Goliath, burn, demonic, omen, blood, skull, fuck.*   
&gt;  
&gt;Or they can be ridiculous to the point of comedy.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Bumfuzzle, bunghole, blubber, scuttlebutt, Wumbo, Plumbus.*  
The spoken-word piece that first made me notice this was[ Captain Beeheart’s “Well,”](https://youtu.be/Uig_EbXYwn0) which is dominated by low vowels, making it sound grand and ominous even though the lyrics don’t make sense.  He even reads it in a way that bends middle and high vowels down to low ones, pronouncing a’s as “uh”s and e’s as “eu”s.  This can make indecipherable phrases *sound* deep and meaningful because of the way he words them.    
&gt;  
&gt;*My life ran through my veins,*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Whistlin’ hollow, well*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I froze in solid motion, well well*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I heard the ocean swarmin’ body, well*   
&gt;  
&gt;\- Mid sounds are neutral and can be added to either a high or a low word without changing it’s feel much, or to center it, like Ah, Aw, Eh, and short I’s.  Words dominated by middle tones can go either way, or express emotions somewhere in between.  Maybe they make you feel…  Something, but you have no idea what.    
&gt;  
&gt;*Capricorn, fidget spinner, mediocre, ding-dong, void, fabulous.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Sometimes they sound kinda weird and off-kilter.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Doggerel, ogrish, snoozer, clown, lungfish, Shoggoth, Ongo Gablogian.*  
\- Striking a balance between elegant and scary, O sounds are often used to convey power and impressiveness, hence why they’re the masculine ending in romance languages and associated with male names.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Awesome\*, opulent, glorious, overpower, colossus, conqueror, dominant, God.*  
&gt;  
&gt;\*Note the A is pronounced as another short O.  
&gt;  
&gt;The vast majority of words have a mix of high and low ones that even each other out.  Or they don’t have any rhythm or flow and are just neutral.  They’re utilitarian and convey meaning instead of sounding like a feeling.  Others go from high at the beginning to low at the end or vice-versa, but I haven't figured out what emotional connotations these have yet, if any.",1590015808,C5Jones,3

What's really odd to me is how often these elements are present even when there is no genetic relationship between the languages.

If Wikipedia is to be believed, all or most of the attributes I've described are present in Chinookan, Washo, Navajo, Classical Nahuatl, Yucatec Maya, Tsimshian, Cherokee, Purépecha, Haida, Alsea, Nuxalk, and the Wakashan languages like Kwak'wala. Unless I made a mistake, none of these languages are related to any of the others. So why so much similarity between their phonologies?

Obviously there are a ton of examples that don't have these attributes, the Eskimo-Aleut languages for instance usually have very few of these features. But I find it striking how similar so many unrelated languages are around North and Central America, especially since the idea of a reconstructible Amerind proto-language is very unpopular amongst linguists.

I'm guessing the answer is either extensive contact between speakers of these languages resulted in shared phonological features, or that the similarities are just coincidental, and a more comprehensive analysis of all languages within this region would show no such notable patterns. Or maybe even cross-linguistically, all these features are actually quite common, and it's more unusual that many European languages, for instance, have bilabial fricatives but lack labial-velar stops. OR could it be that these similar phonological features actually do point to the existence of an original Amerind language that had some of these features, but such a language is too old for linguists to reconstruct.

A few months ago, I stumbled upon the term 'cryptophasia'. As I learnt more about it, read various articles, etc., I was elated to find out that what my sister (two years younger than me) and I had been doing since we were little had an actual name and was very well documented. However, all the articles, observations and definitions of cryptophasia applied to twins.

Since we were about 6 and 8 respectively, my sister and I have spoken (around 2 out of 10 interactions), in a language that only us two can understand. It is not gibberish, as it has a grammar, and even a somewhat random phonology. It is based on French and Spanish (our native languages), as well as a conlang I'd made when I was 7. As I grew aware of it being a rare(?) occurence, I had many friends and family listen to it, none of them being able to understand it.

I wish to elaborate on some points. Please note that I am in no way saying this is a proper language, as its use is heavily dependent on context and has been since it 'arose'. I am genuinely asking what you think it may be, because I have no idea.

**Grammar**  
Pronouns substantially differ from the languages we speak, despite obviously being based on some of the latter. 

||Our language|French|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1SG|ye /je/|je|
|2SG|tune /tune/|tu|
|3SG|ne /ne/|il (3SG masc.), elle (3SG fem.)|
|1PL|nemne /nemne/|nous|
|2PL|vu /vu/|vous|
|3PL|ne /ne/|ils (3PL m.), elles (3PL fem.)|

&amp;#x200B;

|1SG|neme /neme/|mon, ma, mes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2SG|dene /dene/|ton, ta, tes|
|3SG|sene /θ̼ene/|son, sa, ses|
|1SG|(-)|notre/nôtre, nos|
|2SG |(-)|votre/vôtre, vos|
|3SG|sene  /θ̼ene/|leur, leurs|

&amp;#x200B;

As for verbs, *to be* and *have* are both unrelated to our native languages, while other verbs such as *eat* are.

&amp;#x200B;

||ih (*to be*)|ze, ve (*to have*)|manve (*to eat)*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||ye ih|ye ze|ye manv|
||tune ih|tune ze|tune manv|
||ne iht|ne zet|ne manv|
||nemne ih(t)|nemne ze |ong manv|
||vuv et (*French: vous êtes)*|*(-)*|vu manve(t)|
||ne iht|ne ze|ne manv|

Usual sentences including such verbs include :  
***ze*** *tune manvet?* (have you eaten) (F. : *est-ce que t'as mangé?*)  
*ke(ne)* ***ze*** *tune fet?* (what did you do) (F.: *qu'est-ce que t'as fait?*)  
*fene* ***iht*** *muy binong* (this is very tasty) (F. *c'est très bon*/Span. *sabe muy rico*)  
*kene* ***iht****?* (what is it?) (F. *qu'est-ce qu'il y'a ?*)  
*we* ***iht*** *neme orənd?* (where's my computer?) (F. *il est où on ordi?*)  


**2. Phonology**

As I mentioned, it is rather random and features a *ton* of allophones. 

There are basically two fricatives: a voiced, and a devoiced one (which I wrote as *v/z* and *f/s* respectively). Depending on the situation, they are realized as /ð̼/-/ð/-/v/ and /θ̼/-/θ/-/f/, the first two realizations perhaps stemming from a voluntary 'lisp'-like pronounciation from our childhood.

/r/ is consistently trilled or flap-or-tap, like Spanish but unlike French. 

Vowels are mostly similar to French, except nasals, which have undergone denasalization and are rendered as ɛŋ, oŋ and aŋ.

**3. Vocabulary**

It is not dissimilar to that of French, and to a lesser extent Spanish.

linguistics,How did English transition from grammatical cases to analytic structures?,"So, with the exception of pronouns, Modern English doesn't have grammatical cases (i.e. inflection of nouns to indicate their role), but it did back when it was Anglisc. The thing that confuses me though is how could a Germanic language (i.e. agglutinative, case-driven, etc.) *naturally transition* into a language that typologically looks like it should be from Asia, not Europe.

I understand that even with cases, it had an SVO word order (and other orders depending on the voice, if it's a question, etc.), which does explain how it could do away with any differences between nominative and accusative cases. What it doesn't explain is the dative and genitive cases.

There are several different structures for each of these cases, in the case of dative, using the words **to** or **for**, and in the case of genitive, using the word **of**, the clitic **'s**, or consecutive nouns (e.g. ""fountain of chocolate"" can also be phrased as ""chocolate fountain""; this can even be done multiple times e.g. ""the/a lid of the/a box of sand"" becomes ""sand box lid""). There are probably other structures for these as well that I'm not thinking of.

If English had cases which address the issue of semantic roles, it doesn't make much sense for a new layer of complexity to develop for an issue already solved. And if these structures developed after the disappearance of the cases, that would mean there would have been a period of time between cases and structures where people couldn't communicate those semantic roles (which I find extremely unlikely).

I'm a newbie to linguistics, and instruction in traditional settings are crucial for me to understand the concepts of new things. Unfortunately, I haven't had the chance to achieve that this term, and I'm taking Syntax class. So here goes the question,  


  

""The sentence given below is grammatical, however, it seems like to cause a problem for X-bar theory."" 

\- James gave the book to Susan. 

a) First, specify what the problem is for X-bar theory.

b) Then, find out how the problem is resolved in generative grammar.""  


This is one of the questions of my paper. I tried so hard but couldn't decide on the answer myself. Here goes what I understand from this sentence:  


I thought that the sentence could be problematic since if we try to draw a regular tree diagram for it, it is impossible to observe the hierarchical relationship between the nodes. That's why we need to see the subgroups. So, a more detailed tree is needed here.  
OR  
Maybe there are 2 complements to the head at first look? So we need to find the complement and the adjunct? Might that be the root for the problem?  


Well I can't answer the second question since I'm not sure what causes the problem. Any help is appreciated! I wish you all healthy days.

linguistics,Question about languages (as far as I know some North-American languages) where some verbs can only have animate subjects.,"Years and years ago on an amateur linguist forum people argued that  PIE or Proto-IE had what those people called an Active/Stative allignment. In this type of alligment they said inanimate nouns cannot be subjects of transitive verbs, because there is no need for animate nouns to be subjects of transitive nouns because as they are inanimate they cannot be agents and therefore not subjects of transitive verbs. I always thought this line of reasoning was a bit weird, because obviously, in Western languages you have inanimate subjects of transitive verbs all the time, for instance as in ""The rock killed the ant"" ""This incident ended his career"" or ""earthquakes frighten me."", and it goes against all my instincts as a linguist that those sentences are inexpressible in some languages, but that was what those people argued for. 

This week I did some digging, and found some handbooks of PIE that indeed mentioned this theory, and argued it was plausible, and mentioned Siouan languages and Na-Dene language as languages that had this alliggnment. However, they didn't give any example sentences that clarify exactly how this would work. When I followed it up, the first problem is that most people take the term Active/Stative allignment as much wider as the writers of those PIE handbooks, and usually people use the term to define all split ergative languages. When I looked for sources for those languages in particular I did see some reputable sources mention it, but I couldn't find out exactly how it worked, as I found a surprising lack of grammars of these languages online. For instance, one source was a review of a grammar of a Siouan language, where the sentence ""transitive verbs cannot have animate subjects"" was mentioned as an example of a typo, but I couldn't consult the grammar myself. 

So if it is indeed the case that in some languages some verbs can only have animate subjects, I wonder how those sentences mentioned above are expressed in those languages. I realize that there are work-arounds, for the first two sentences you could say something along the lines of ""because of the rock, the ant was killed"", or ""because of this incident, his career ended."",  and for the last sentence you can say ""I am afraid of earthquakes."". However, I suspect that such work-arounds are more let's say standardized in those languages if inanimate subjects are never possible for transitive verbs.

linguistics,Proto-Indo-European and tone,"I've been reading through the Wikipedia articles on Proto-Indo-European and apparently there's a theory that PIE had phonemic tone rather than / in addition to its generally-accepted odd lexical stress system. Not being an expert in IE studies, I've got a couple of questions about this theory:

1. Is this just a fringe theory, or something that has some real scientific merit? Does it really seem to be positing something worth considering?
2. How good an understanding of tone is it based on? (i.e. is it an autosegmental analysis?) If it's not based on a modern understanding of tone, has anyone (reasonably) attempted to apply autosegmental / metrical principles to PIE supersegmentals?

I'm asking in part because PIE is often described as having a 'pitch-accent' system, which [I don't believe is a real thing](https://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~hyman/papers/2009-hyman-pitchaccent.pdf); and I'm wondering if there are good and modern non-'pitch-accent' descriptions of PIE supersegmentals out there. I tend to assume that if there's a chance something is tone it probably is, since tone tends to be both undernoticed by and badly understood by a lot of linguists; but of course not every such thing is going to turn out to be actually tone. I feel like I remember that there was a decent tonal analysis of Ancient Greek 'accent' out there (which I'm going to look up now); I'm curious if there's something like that for PIE.",1589647399,sjiveru,52
linguistics,Is linguistic gender always arbitrary?,"I mean, most languages I know of that have gender tend to assign it quite at random whenever the main feature used for defining it is not met (for simplicity I will assume a classic FEM, MASC, NEUT gender partition, but my question goes to any other defining feature of gender like LONG, ROUND, NEITHER). Like a chair is neither female nor male, so: pick one at random even though we have also a NEUT. But, imagine that a chair is always NEUT because it has no social gender nor sex. Would that still count as a linguistic gender? I mean, most things would fall out of the feature used to assign gender, so the overwhelming majority of nouns would be NEUT. At that point, wouldn't be better to analyze the whole system as genderless and only identifying those marks as some kind of marker of a feature of the referent? I mean, Spanish marks animate nouns through the clitic ""a"" and I've never seen anyone say that Spanish has an Animate gender. So, is gender necessarily arbitrary?

linguistics,Language Stigmatization?,"One of my biggest obsessions of late are Indigenous American languages; I find many of them fascinating to learn about as they seem to have very unique grammatical features not found in other languages around the world.  However, there seems to be a common trend of both shame and stigmatization amongst the native languages spoken throughout the continent, especially in Latin America.    

Here are a couple of articles that touch on this: 

[About Peru and Quechua](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/world/americas/peru-indigenous-rap-renata-flores.html)

[About the state of indigenous languages in Latin America in general](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-latam-indigenous-language-idUSKCN1UN04W)

In Latin America, being an ""indio/india"" can have the negative connotations of being poor, ""rural"" (low-class), and backwards, and as such speaking the language is associated with these stereotypes.  This leads to indigenous peoples not wanting to pass down their native tongue to their children, which can eventually lead to language death.  That's to say nothing of the fact that, in the past, some kids were often berated for speaking their language in schools.

So now I'm wondering if this is a common phenomenon around the world?  I believe there is a similar cultural stigma against Scots, and have certain stereotypes associated with it.",1589588459,novaleven,7

linguistics,The Malagasy exception to the cooperative principle,"I've been reading about the [cooperative principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle) which ""describes how people achieve effective conversational communication in common social situations—that is, how listeners and speakers act cooperatively and mutually accept one another to be understood in a particular way"".

The maxims being:

1. Be truthful

2. Be informative

3. Be relevant



There is an example in that Wikipedia article for those not familiar with this concept. The maxims are not prescriptions for how speakers should act, but rather describe assumptions we make about the other speaker's words when communicating. 


What was particularly interesting is that the Malagasy appear to act opposite to this.

&gt; In their culture, speakers are reluctant to share information and flout the maxim of quantity by evading direct questions and replying on incomplete answers because of the risk of losing face by committing oneself to the truth of the information, as well as the fact that having information is a form of prestige.[8][9] However, Harnish points out[10] that Grice only claims his maxims hold in conversations where his cooperative principle is in effect. The Malagasy speakers choose not to be cooperative, valuing the prestige of information ownership more highly. (It could also be said in this case that this is a less cooperative communication system, since less information is shared.)

[This book, Pragmatics and Natural Language Understanding \(Page 100\) goes into a little more detail.] (https://books.google.com/books?id=zuqXpfZ4QVIC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=malagasy+cooperative+principle&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uXhxkCJsSQ&amp;sig=ACfU3U2hbFnEqNGpl9gzKc85KzBOp4mKGw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiZw_3MubLpAhWFc98KHUa4BA0Q6AEwDnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=malagasy%20cooperative%20principle&amp;f=false) The relucatance to make claims that may be false is, in my opinion, an admiral trait. Yet I was fascinated by the idea that information in Malagasy culture is treated as a prized commodity and confers prestige, leading to intentional withholding of such from others. I'm curious as to the implications this has on the societal level.

In doing so, on paper it loses its past marker, or rather it gives ""of"" a new meaning as a past marker. The past marker is still there in the following past participle, but in any case ""of"" takes on a totally new function separate from it's usual prepositional or partitive character.

linguistics,"Can ""squirrel"" be pronounced with one syllable?","I noticed that me and all of my friends (in the US) pronounce Squirrel as what we feel is a one syllable word. We also recognize that it can be pronounced as two syllables in some places (like in fancy British English). However an Aussie friend of mine who studies linguistics said Squirrel is two syllables everywhere, and that it is a confusing situation because of the orthography of the word.  


I looked it up on places like Wiktionary and other places and -everywhere- seems to say it is a 2 syllable word, but then when I look up words like whirl (which is a rhyming word in my American English) it says Whirl is one syllable. I seriously feel that Squirrel is one syllable in American English, but no where else seems to academically reflect this?

I've noticed that in certain contexts, the verbs 'be' and 'go' cross over in English, French and Spanish.

1. English 
The verb 'to go' is used except in the present perfect tense, where 'to be' is used instead. 
""I went to Morocco."" 
""I'm going to Morocco.""
""I will go to Morocco.""
*""I have been to Morocco."" 

2. French
Similar to the above: ""I have been to Morocco"" can be translated either with the verb aller (to go) ""Je suis allé..."" or the verb être (to be) ""J'ai été..."" 

3. Spanish
The verbs ir (to go) and ser (to be) are conjugated exactly the same in the preterite (simple past) tense: fui, fuiste, fue... This means that 'fui' can mean 'I went' as well as 'I was', and so on.

Does anyone have any ideas as to why this is the case? Are the two verbs interchangeable historically? TIA",1589223569,sje032,2

linguistics,Aksharamukha: Script Coverter and Noto Sans,"So recently I came upon a Google's project, where they are creating proper fonts for a huge number of scripts. I remember a post, where some people were developing script for Kharoshthi. They can benefit from this.

Using these fonts, a application with name Aksharamukha has been developed, which focuses on mainly on Abugida or Indic Scripts.
So now you can type in your language in the script which you is now more prevalent and get output in script as required.

E.g. Takri script was a script used to primarily write Pahari Languages of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand, in India. 
A standard Dogra script was derived from it to write Dogri Language in Jammu region. 

Almost all of the native speakers of this language have shifted to write Pahari or Dogri in Devanagari script. Since both these scripts are in this platform, and systems are generally Devanagari friendly, now I can get text in Takri script, for a input in Pahari language using Devanagari script. 

Being a Pahari language native, this is excellent, as there are some sporadic attempts to revive these scripts. I hope to write more in my native script and teach others to read and write in it, and ultimately making it more prevalent.

Remember, it is a script converter, not language converter.

Any question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: 

*Quick questions:*

* Asking for an explanation of a technical term
* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature
* Asking how we would transcribe something
* Asking how a feature works in a particular language

*Not-so-quick questions:*

* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

Also, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search.

linguistics,The Turkish Accent of English,"So as a Turkish person, I see many humorous posts, works and other things on accents of non-native English speakers such as Indians, Nigerians, Germans and French yet possibly because of a lesser number of immigrants the Turkish accent doesn't get enough credit. This accent is a result of relatively poor language education in Turkish leading to understanding English as a SVO Turkish with same phonological inventory and understanding of concepts. It is not like academic, but I want to tell about some features I detect in most Turkish-Azerbaijani speakers. And for note, educated Turks tend to speak with an American or German-like accent for Turks mostly see having a strong accent as a bad thing and mock with it.

**Phonology**

So Turkish people tend to understand English as having same phonemic inventory as I said before. Although this isn't that important or spottible of a thing in consonants, it is more clear in vowels for consonants mostly are same.

**Consonants**

As I said before consonants are relatively close to each other. I will list changes I see below. We also don't have the aspirations.

 θ -&gt;t  and  ð -&gt;d I think it's quite common in non-European accents and Irish ones. Turkish doesn't feature dental fricatives, so we tend to understand those this way.

 ɹ  -&gt; ɾ  The flap-tap one is the default realization of r in Turkish, and the realization in English is considered somewhat feminine and gayish when used in Turkish. I think Spanish and Greek also do this.

w -&gt;v So our language hasn't this either, and most Turkish people don't even realize they are different sounds.

ŋ-&gt;ng/nɟ  Actually we basically have the velar nasal consonant in some dialects, mostly in Anatolia but urban generations can't make this sound. In between vowels of English which are realized by Turkish speakers as a, o, u, ı we make ng, and in between those realised as i, e, ö, ü by Turks we make nɟ. Because Turkish has allophones for g, k and l.

k-&gt;(sometimes) c, g-&gt;(sometimes) ɟ and  ɫ-&gt;(sometimes) lʲ Because of the rule I mentioned above, among e, i, ö and ü sounds we palatalize certain consonants.

**Vowels**

Most of the vowels change in Turkish accent, but I won't list unchanged ones such as i:

ɪ-&gt;i or j(mostly in diphtongs) Our language doesn't contain ɪ either.

e-&gt;e and sometimes ɛ We use the broader version when there is one or more m, n, l or r letters in the syllable. We tend to continue this habit in English.

æ-&gt;e We don't originally have this sound too and tend to pronounce it similar to e. A Turk pronounces word back as \[bec\].

 ɑ-&gt;ä Which is default a in Turkish.

 ɒ-&gt;ä or o We follow a more American realization in those two. Box is \[bäks\] when paw is \[pov\].

u:-&gt;u and ʊ-&gt;u I mostly speak without a Turkish accent but I can't even make the ʊ.

 ʌ-&gt;a A Turk would pronounce but as \[bät\] 

 ɜː-&gt; œ For example word bird is \[bœɾd\] for a Turk. This is what I mentioned as ö.

 ə-&gt;ɯ  And this is what I mentioned as ı. A Turk would pronounce customer as \[kas'tɯmɯɾ\]. Though it varies. The one in comma is an a sound and the one in of is an o sound. No specific rule I think.

y is used in certain words, such as cure(cy'uɾ).

For the diphtongs, eɪ is ej, əʊ is o or o:, aɪ is aj, aʊ is ov and ɔɪ is oj.

**Stress and Phonotactics**

We tend to use a pitch accent in Turkish and Turkish accent. Stress is mostly in the last syllable or the one before the last. Sentence's stress is at the noun. We also tend to add a short ɯ sound when a word starts with two consonantal sounds.

**Grammar**

Well, I am possibly poor at this matter but I have certain points.

1. Young people who just started to learn doesn't understand articles. Even the most educated ones simply forget the indefinite article in most sentences. The definite one is frequently forgotten too.
2. We sometimes use stuff like goed and womans for our language rarely has grammatical exceptions. 
3. The present and past perfects are a pain in the back for teachers. This concept does not exist in our language and therefore is mostly hard for us.
4. We tend to mistake prepositions for we don't have ant. Mostly mistake at, in and on. 
5. Due to our use of allative, we tend to use from in places it isn't necessary for English. For example, we say fear from. Same goes for locative and too. We mostly say need to before nouns.
6. Uneducated people mostly forget using to be and make sentences without a verb. It is because we lost our verb corresponding to to be a long time ago except for some fixed phrases.
7. We mostly say you is because we have a strong t-v distinction.
8. Turks tend to forget using it and she and use he instead for we have no grammatical gender.
9. We also mostly don't use objective case in pronouns.
10. We mostly don't understand the difference of going to and will, as well as the difference between must and have to.
11. We tend to forget changing place of verb and subject when forming a question.
12. We also find spelling very hard and often make mistakes.

**Examples**

""The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"" would be pronounced as ""dɯ ku'ic bɾavn foks dʒamps ovɯɾ dɯ lej'zi dog"" in Turkish.

""The chairman of the committee and the loquacious politician clashed violently when the meeting started."" would be ""dɯ tʃe'jɯɾmen of dɯ komi'ti: end dɯ lo'cej'ʃɯs po'lʲitiʃɯn kɯ'lʲɛʃd va'jolɯnt'lʲi vɛn dɯ mi:'tinɟ sɯ'taɾtɯd"".

linguistics,"length-by-the-yard, height-by-the-foot","Hi, I'm new here so hope this is not OT.

whi is it that when we measure heght in the imperial system, we use feet but, when we measure a short distance we use yards?

I found this forum post expanding on this:

 [https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/383532/why-isnt-the-yard-used-as-a-base-unit-for-measuring-heights](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/383532/why-isnt-the-yard-used-as-a-base-unit-for-measuring-heights) 

 

&gt;**Different units of measurement: some observations**  
&gt;  
&gt;They are important for, and reflect the needs of, trade and commerce.  
&gt;  
&gt;They vary between trades or areas of activity — horses are measured in hands, race tracks in furlongs, chemists used to weigh in grains, farmers in bushels. Significantly, depth (with its relation to height) was measured in fathoms, rather than yards. Even today distances and speeds at sea are measure in nautical miles and knots!  
&gt;  
&gt;A single measure was normally used, rather than the combination common today. For example, the Wikipedia entry on yard, quoted above, makes it clear that the introduction of ‘inches’ with yards was a legal measure to replace the black-market ‘handful’, rather than a response to a need to subdivide the unit. Halves and quarters of a single unit would be used.  
&gt;  
&gt;A rationale for the choice of unit of measurement is that it should be small enough that one did not have to subdivide it into more than halves or quarters, and large enough that one does not have to use numbers containing more than two digits — it has to be usable by ordinary people.  
&gt;  
&gt;The 13th century [Statute of Ells and Perches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_of_Yards_and_Perches) standardization of the units of length was a response to local differences in usage (especially of the [yard](https://sizes.com/units/yard.htm)). It would be naive to think that local differences from the standard did not persist. If trade were local, this would hardly matter.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Height: a Hypothesis**  
&gt;  
&gt;My hypothesis is based on the premise that the commercial and practical need to measure height was much less than that to measure length — I can think of that might have been sold on the basis of height. I would suggest that the activity that required this, usage was architecture — probably civil/military, although perhaps also naval. [Christopher Wren’s plans](https://www.stpauls.co.uk/history-collections/the-collections/architectural-archive/wren-office-drawings/wren-and-his-draughtsmen) in the seventeenth century contain measurements in feet, and I suggest this is a continuation of practice that well may have been first adopted in Anglo-Norman times.  
&gt;  
&gt;Why would architects have adopted feet, given that they were specifying length and breadth as well as height? One might argue that height was particularly important, and feet were already in use for measuring height. I do not know whether either of these assertions is true. An alternative is that the yard was much more ambiguous than the foot. Although the master builder may have adhered to the official standard, the workmen executing his plans might have had their own yard. Finally, it may have just been that the yard was too long for the detail required, and the foot and its half and quarter were more convenient.  
&gt;  
&gt;**It would be nice to know…**  
&gt;  
&gt;My hypothesis is difficult to prove, but it would be helpful to have more facts about the historical measurement of height:  
&gt;  
&gt;How was height specified in the oldest historical documents in English that mention it? Was it indeed a concern — did people care about the exact height of a tall or small individual or of geographical features such as mountains?  
&gt;  
&gt;What units are used in the oldest English architectural plans that specify them?  
&gt;  
&gt;Am I right in saying that different units were not mixed? When were measurements first specified in a mixture of yards and feet, for example?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Footnote: Different meanings of the word ‘yard’ as a unit of measurement**  
&gt;  
&gt;According to the first edition of The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) ‘yard’, as used for a unit of length (and in several related meanings), is derived from a word which in different Germanic languages has the sense of pole, rod, prickle (and hence its obsolete use defined in OED-11 — “virile member, penis”). This is distinct from the origin of the word ‘yard’ with the general meaning of “inclosure” (sic).  
&gt;  
&gt;As well as its equivalence (or that of the ell) to three feet, specified in the thirteenth century (OED–9, first example cited using the designation, ‘yard’, in 1377), another meaning of yard or landyard (OED–8) is given as “a unit of linear measure equal to 16½ feet…(but varying locally).” The OED cites a source as recent as 1856 which states “As a linear measure the yard varies considerably in different parts of the kingdom; at Hereford the landyard is 3 feet, at Saltash 16½ feet; at Falmouth and Bridgend 18 feet; and at Dowanpatrick 11 feet.”  
&gt;  
&gt;A definition for this derivation of ‘yard’ in terms of area is also given in OED-10: “An area of land of varying extent according to the locality, but most frequently 30 acres” with usage dating back to 688–95.”

linguistics,Why do some languages have multiple words for second person pronouns?,"In English the word is '*you*'. There is only one word for this as far as I am aware.

But, in some Indian languages there are different words for second person pronoun, depending on context. For example, in Hindi 

1. आप, pronounced as *Aap*. Used either when you are talking to an elder person (or someone you wish to show respect to) or when you are referring to more than one person (plural context). 
2. तुम, pronounced as *Tum*.  Used either when you are talking to someone like a friend, a colleague, someone younger than you etc. Or in the singular context.

There are some exceptions to the descriptions above, but mostly this is how it goes. There are some other Indian languages that have the same phenomenon.

Is there a reason for why it's this way? Also, are there other languages (non-Indian) that have something similar?",1588852429,123abracadabra,2

As we know, *go* as a quotative was originally used only for sounds, and not speech.

But I had a thought. We tell kids, the cow goes moo, and the duck goes quack, &amp;c.

Then we proceed to give them many books and movies where animals don't just make sounds, they say words.

The children then (in the 1960's or so) begin to say things such as ""Fred **went** 'that's my glove!'"".

Meanwhile, if they responded, ""I'm putting this tool in the trash,"" I would get frustrated at this (in my opinion) overly-literal answer.

linguistics,Discussion: What model of English should be taught?,"&amp;#x200B;

Between the 'native-speaker, 'nativized', and 'lingua franca' models, which model should be taught around the world? For those unfamiliar with the terms, a brief summary of the terms:

The nativized speaker model is that which everyone should be aware of, it is the model of English spoken in L1 English speaking countries i.e British, American, Australian, etc. The advantage of such a model is that it has been codified and as such has norms which learners can be tested against. Furthermore, it is seen as a standard variety

The nativized model on the other hand, is the kind of English where it has been adapted to the cultural and social norms of the country where it is not the L1 but is used as an intra-language i.e used in institutions nationally. The country in which this model is spoken in is those with colonial heritage.

The Lingua Franca model is used as a means of communication between linguistics and sociocultural backgrounds between non-native speakers to communicate internationally. It is taught in countries wherein English is not a native language and whose countries have no colonial backgrounds.

It is easy to think of the different kinds of models in relation to Kachru's ""Three Circles"" wherein we have:

* The Inner Circle: USA, UK,... ""mother tongue varieties"", L1 contexts = norm providing
* The Outer Circle: India, Singapore,... institutional role, often colonial heritage = norm developing
* The Expanding Circle: China, Russia,... international communication = norm dependent

Usually speakers learn a language in order to speak with native speakers of that language. When a speaker learns Chinese for example, they don't expect to use it to speak to a Brazilian person, rather they expect to use it to communicate with a Chinese native speaker. However, this is clearly not the case with English. Rather, with English, it is learned as a reason to speak to many different parts of the world. It was estimated some time ago by David Crystal (so these numbers are without a doubt not accurate anymore and have only increased), that there are around 329m native-speakers but over 1.5 billion English speakers in the world. Clearly does not 'belong' to the native speakers any longer and has developed to become a world language. I would be interested in hearing the thoughts of TEFL teachers or any other English teachers on this topic. Which model are you teaching? Which model would you prefer to be taught?",1588677099,Brit_in_Lux,89

There are plenty of memes floating around the internet demonstrating inconsistent grammar, how rules of thumb don't work, baffling spelling where the same vowel pairs are pronounced many different ways or where many different spellings are pronounced the same way, etc. 

My understanding is that this has to do with a fairly interesting history, being a Germanic language that was influenced by the local Goidelic and Brittonic languages, various romance languages, several invasions of different Germanic languages, and now, admixture from the many languages English interacts with, which is nearly all of them at this point.

While this is interesting, I wonder how true it is. Does English really stand out as being more piecemeal than other languages? If so, why have languages from other empires not had the same problem? Essentially all languages originate from an area that has had to interact with many other languages through trade or war, many other languages have been the primary language of an empire dominating many nations with their own languages.

Example  [from Danish](https://i.imgur.com/DhzJr2a.png) 

I really like how noticing transformations like this instantly improves the understanding of the other language as long as you already have a decent knowledge of the first one. There are more straightforward examples in other languages, for example most Slavic languages say and write 'g' in some places whereas in some others it has changed to 'h' ( Czech, Ukrainian, Slovak and maybe Rusyn or some others)  so for example  [the difference between Slovak and Polish](https://i.imgur.com/US5zHeZ.png) gets much smaller the moment you realize this rule (this specific case is hard to miss, but simplest examples are best)   


The more languages you are familiar with, the easier is to learn to understand additional ones (that are related to the ones you're already familiar with) and in my experience, realizing the existence of these transformation rules makes learning even faster. My favorite ones are rules that go back thousands of years, applying them backwards to words that belong to superficially unrelated languages suddenly makes the languages to resemble each other  (to be fair, it's impossible for me to see them as unrelated anyway, but many people still think that the commonalities are there because of Latin / Greek influence, when in reality that was just branches bending towards each other for a bit, they all stem from the same root).",1588587754,nikto123,3

linguistics,"Are phrases like “take home” counted as one word, or two? Why/why not?","Just as a disclaimer, I don’t have any background in this kind of thing so this might be a stupid question but I figured y’all probably know. Posting here rather than in the Q&amp;A because this seems like something people might want to have a discussion around.

You can say “I’m taking the book to school” but not “I’m taking the book school” or “I’m taking school the book,” however the opposite is true when you get rid of “school” and use “home” instead.

What’s going on here? Is “home” still an indirect object? Is it some kind of weird adverb? I thought that maybe “take home” could be a single verb that is in the process of forming and hasn’t been joined together yet, but that wouldn’t explain why I can say “I’m taking the book home” (unless it does? I know that some languages have single words that surround other words).

I’m not entirely sure that this is right, mostly because while “I’m taking the book John” isn’t valid until it gets a comma (at which point it takes on a *wildly* different sentiment), “I’m taking John the book” seems pretty normal, and “John” definitely isn’t half a verb. Similarly, I can bring Sally the ball and I can bring the ball to Sally, but I can’t bring the ball Sally or bring *work* the ball. I can, however, bring *home* the ball.

Maybe rather than being part of the verb, “home” is just a proper noun, as there seems to be a pattern there. The thing is that that *still* doesn’t explain why I can “bring the ball home,” or why I’m unable to “bring the ball *to* home.”

Basically, I have three questions:

1. How is the word “home” functioning in the sentences “I’m taking home the book” and “I’m taking the book home?”

2. My initial guess was almost certainly wrong, but are there any examples of indirect objects that are *currently* being incorporated with other words to create a single, more specific verb? In those instances, would we consider the whole thing to be a single word or does that only happen when the space gets dropped?

3. Are there any other English words that act in a similar way?",1588394347,nebulaeandstars,2

I recognize ""whose"" is supposedly able to be used with human and non-human subjects, but I have heard ""thats"" being used and have used it myself too, as it feels more natural in situations where the subject is inanimate.

Ex. ""The house thats basement is really big"" or ""Do you have a hat thats brim is a little more flat?""  or ""The book thats pages are really torn up""

I recognize this is incorrect usage ""officially"", and the sentences could easily be reworded to have proper grammar again. However I was wondering if this is a more widespread phenomena than just me having a linguistic brain fart. I swear I have heard this used in colloquial speech before.

What do you think?

Edit: Upon a quick google search, there does not appear to be a ton of info on this. An article about the new linguistic development of ""thats"" and a wordpress blog article about the same thing.

linguistics,Relative Clauses: NP-S vs NOM-S interpretation,"What are people's opinions on the different analysis of relative clauses and their modifying nature? I'm much the opinion of following a Montagueian approach on this since personally, relative clauses have the semantic property of modifying common nouns, not common noun phrases. That is, that in sentences like *The man who dates Mary*, the relative clause *who dates Mary* first combines with the common noun *man* which forms the common noun phrase *man who dates Mary* and then combines with the determiner to form *the man who dates Mary*. The combination of syntactic and semantic rules lie at the heart of  compositional structures, thus my stance in this approach as syntactically, relative clauses must combine  with common nouns.

I'm interested in hearing other people's opinion on this? I know there are other's out there who are more inclined to the idea that *man* first combines with *the* which the relative clause *who dates Mary* attaches to. What are the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches in your opinion?",1588334520,Brit_in_Lux,1
linguistics,What is the definition of a word?,"Hi, first time poster (ever) on Reddit, but I didn't know where to turn.   


I coach rugby and there are constant arguments around definitions and technical terms. In the briefest sense, it is my belief that there are a multitude of languages we all speak, even it appears we only speak English. Words definitions change depending on context and intent right?   


So in a sporting context, academic theory states the definition of the word ""skill"" is something like ""An applied pattern of motor control within game context"" (I cant find the exact definition, this came from conversation).   
Where as the dictionary definition states "" *noun*: **skill**

1. the ability to do something well; expertise.""difficult work, taking great skill"" h Similar:expertise

* a particular ability.plural noun: **skills**""the skills of cookery"" n present: **skills**; past tense: **skilled**; past participle: **skilled**; gerund or present participle: **skilling**

1. train (a worker) to do a particular task.""there is a lack of basic skilling""

Below I have pasted a couple of paragraphs from my own writing. This is simply an example of me battling with the concept of definition. I have no real education on the matter outside of High School and the only linguist I knew deleted Facebook! To be honest I'm not even sure if this is a linguistic question. Any help is much appreciated!!  


*""The definition of a word does not exist in any dictionary. It in fact exists somewhere in the space between the speakers mouth and the listeners ear. It changes it definition based on the tone spoken, the context written, the environment or the social or political stage where it is uttered. The definition of any word is as varied and nuanced as the thought capacity of all the people using it. It is for this reason it is so important that when creating any team culture, mantra or indeed philosophy that the understanding is as thoroughly investigated as time and resources permit.*  
  

*To me an adult is a person who makes their own decisions. A person who autonomously decides on a course of action, and importantly, faces the consequences of those actions. If you claim to like a song simply because it is popular I consider you a child. Unthinking. The same however goes for the person who refuses to like a song due to its popularity. That too is childish. An adult likes or dislikes the song of their own volition, not their peers. They make their choice. If the definition of “adult” was simply the culturally relevant age (i.e 16, 18, 21 depending on country) then the phrase “Behave like an Adult” would make no sense whatsoever. There is already an expectation within the definition of some form of responsibility. It is this subjective line that grants me the freedom to define the word as I see fit and appropriate. This is another opportunity to examine the spectrum of all things. As I don’t believe in any form of binary existence outside of the most basic mathematics, this definition of “Adult” also has its vagaries and contradictions. ""*

linguistics,Interlanguages vs Pidgins?,"I've been learning about Language Acquisition at university and I'm finding it super interesting! Two of the concepts we covered are interlanguage and pidgins/pidginization. One thing I'm wondering about though is what really differentiates the two from one another? 

In my understanding, interlanguage is sort of a midpoint between a learner's L1 and L2, a system that they come up with in order to bridge the gap between the two languages as they try to learn an L2. Whereas a pidgin develops as a result of contact between groups with two different languages, and is also kind of a midpoint between those two languages to faciliate communication. 

So my question is: Is the only major difference between interlanguage and pidginization their primary functions and why they come about? Because if they both represent a midpoint between two languages then I don't really see how they differ in what they actually ARE. So is the main distinction just WHY they exist?

On the other hand, under the assumption that we systematically derive meaning from novel pieces of language, creating a formal system that underlies this process seems necessary.

I hope this is the right place to post this, but if not I’d appreciate it if y’all could point me in the right direction. I felt like this was too long and broad for a single comment on the Higher Ed Wednesday thread. I have a few questions regarding the reputations of specific linguistics programs in several of the schools. I have been researching online, but I’d like some insight from people who are already involved in the field. For context, I am a high school senior considering Brown, Yale, and Princeton, and I am very conflicted as far as which one to choose (but incredibly grateful to have this decision in front of me). I am leaning more toward the first two simply because they are closer to home, but I have not completely ruled out Princeton if the linguistics department is particularly strong there. I was also waitlisted at Dartmouth, so any information about their program’s strengths and weaknesses would be very helpful should I find myself in the position to go there in the next few months. 

I am not entirely certain which subfield of linguistics I’d like to pursue, but I am leaning more toward the humanities/historical approach than the neuroscience side of things. I am also very interested in classics and philosophy, so if there is any program in particular that is also known for those connections, that would be ideal. As far as future plans go, I definitely intend to get a Master’s degree, and a PhD is on the bucket list. Those will most likely also be in linguistics, but I’m not entirely set on that yet. My dream job would probably be some sort of international editor/translator/publisher, especially if that were to be at a dictionary. Any suggestions or advice for pursuing a career in linguistics would be great too. I don’t necessarily want to teach but I would consider doing so at the college level. 

Any information on the departments and how they compare from your perspectives would help a lot. (I would also appreciate to any general advice about the schools outside of their academics.)

linguistics,I need help providing evidence as to whether the model verb ‘need’ can be used in the stand alone sentence “I need fly”.,"TL;DR I need to prove that “I need fly” is an incorrect use of need as a modal verb.

So today me and my girl got talking about the uses of need as a model verb when I tried to correct her when she said “I need fly”.

Let me start by saying she is generally amazing with grammar and that she is an English teacher here in China. Although being a previous ESL learner herself I occasionally find little speech errors usually in pronunciation. Today I was surprised that she adamantly asserted that we were both correct and that “I need fly” and “I need to fly” are one and the same.

The thought of “I need fly” being correct just didn’t jibe well with me. So I made her a bet that ¥200 says that she is wrong. It is not a lot of money but it made it more interesting as now it would not be something we just forget about. So now I need to provide her with evidence to show that we cannot say “I need fly”.

I started with the ‘Oxford Dictionary of English’ app for IPhone which gave me this:

[as modal, with negative or in questions] expressing necessity or obligation: 
need I say more?
all you need bring are sheets.

This went well as I could tell her that “I need fly” is not negative or a question that expresses necessity or obligation. Trouble arose when she saw the examples and asked me to explain why “all you need bring are sheets” is correct but “I need fly” is wrong.

After this I headed to dictionary.com where I found this:

(takes an infinitive without to) used as an auxiliary in negative and interrogative sentences to express necessity or obligation, and does not add -s when used with he, she, it, and singular nouns: need he go?

I then tried to justify it as “all you need bring are towels” is an interrogative sentence that expresses an obligation that they bring towels in this situation. Although I was unsure if it was interrogative and she could feel that. 

She tried to say that was an affirmative statement and that “I need fly” is affirmative and that her sentence is a necessity as for her example she needed to fly that day. I am not convinced and we are now at an impasse.

I feel the sentences she provided as examples “I need fly” “I need cook” and “I need go” for all intents and purposes need to have to after need and all do not express obligation or necessity.

She feels I have another think coming. I feel I could be wrong so I have come here in hopes that someone can set us straight. Help us get to the bottom of this reddit.

linguistics,Does Australian English have some r-coloured vowels?,"Over the past year or so there have been viral posts by Americans making fun of Australian accents, particularly the way Australians say the /oʊ/ or /əʊ/ diphthong (in ""know"", ""boat"" etc), for example [this recent viral tweet](https://twitter.com/blanketm9/status/1254626576051974144):

also a similar earlier [tweet](https://twitter.com/i/status/1179558670448955392):

&gt;australians in the replies like “nœruh”

I think this started with a [TikTok trend last year](https://www.pedestrian.tv/news/american-teens-are-obsessed-with-h2o-just-add-water-and-they-wont-stop-mocking-us/) where American teenagers parodied the 2000s Australian children's/teen tv series *H2O: Just Add Water*.

(for the record I'm Australian and I find all of this hilarious)

For a relevant reference, notice how Cleo(rh), played by Phoebe Tonkin, [says ""no"" and ""don't"" in a scene from the show](https://youtu.be/aZkz7UBZp_4?t=35). It's relatively subtle but I feel the ""r-colouring"" is noticeably distinct from usual Australian English fronting? I wouldn't know where to start in finding ""field"" examples but anecdotally I have heard examples in real life that were more pronounced than Phoebe's in that clip. Another comedy example is [Prue and Trude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZXDOt1Vi_Y) in the classic Australian sitcom *Kath &amp; Kim*, whose entire running joke is the exaggeration of this feature; you can also hear it in Chris Lilley's [Ja'mie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1voe4u6cR0I) (somewhat nsfw).

I think most Australians would be familiar with the accent but I haven't seen it acknowledged outside of a comedic context. I've generally associated it with middle-upper class Melbourne but I don't think it's limited to that demographic.

With my Australian ear I had never associated it with an /ɹ/ sound until seeing those memes, but after thinking about it I feel like there's little difference between say, a rhotic American pronunciation of ""nor"" and a strong ""no"" in this variety of Aus English. So is it/should it be narrowly transcribed as such?

**TL;DR:** when some Australian English speakers say /oʊ/ (and potentially other back rounded diphthongs) it sounds a lot like an r-coloured vowel in a rhotic /oɹ/. Is this something that's recognised?",1588170934,langisii,21

linguistics,Asian titles for COVID-19,"I've been keeping up with various East Asian forms of East Asian media (both non-MSM and MSM) for the whole debacle, and I realise that while Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and to a certain extent where I'm from (not East Asia but we are Chinese), we all use either ""Wuhan Virus"" or ""Wuhan Pneumonia"", although the former is decreasing in use where I'm from (Chinese but we speak English, I suppose you can already guess). 

Korea has 우한폐렴 (lit. Wuhan Pneumonia), same for Hong Kong and Taiwan, but in Chinese characters. (武漢肺炎)

linguistics,"Different vocal tones for different languages, not on purpose?","Good day fellows other-language-students,

My mother tongue is Italian, I speak English fluently and I'm studying German and Russian.
I noticed something: I tend to change the tone of my voice based on the language that I speak, and I don't do that on purpose.

For example, I tend to speak English with a way deeper voice than German, where it tends to be higher pitched, and it changes a lot with Russian, where it goes from super high to deep. I'd say the tone I use for Italian is my ""standard one""?

Now, I know that in Russian this is important and part of the language, but in Eng and Ger it's not about if it's a question tone, affermative tone... just deeper overall for Eng, higher pitched for Ger.

Is there any scientific study on this topic? Do languages have some kind of ""right tone"" specifically for them? Why do I accidentally do these changes?

linguistics,Experience to Expression,"Can language ever reveal non-dualistic reality? When language is essentially a dualistic medium. 

When we experience a certain moment of profundity or could be any regular experience for that matter. I had felt, like most of you would find. How incapable language is, to express, even a mere bit of the experience. There was a day when I had felt our greatest fear is not being able to express ourselves. All our life we struggle with language. Don't we all fear of being misunderstood! 

Language is a system which can't even express in actuality, even the simplest of experiences we have. If I say I am hurt. Will that ever express the nature of actual pain. It gets more difficult when it is a pain of psychological manner. A trauma! Even more difficult to be expressed. 
When we explain an experience. Principally, it cannot remain a first hand experience anymore. 

An essential Jacques Derrida analogy on this matter would be ""Is there anything CAT about a cat?"" A CAT is CAT because it is not a DOG. It is only difference that creates meaning. Essentially the word CAT has no meaning. Discrimination is the essence of language. 

'Discrimination' we will get back to word in a while.

Matter is regarded as Naama Rupa (Name and Form) in Sanskrit. Matter always has a form. No matter can exist without a form. A form is definitely a classification which can exist in the background of formless. 
 Does the fire burn itself? That which is the knower of knowledge is never itself an object of knowledge. As Adi Shankaracharya had explained. 

""Mystery of life is a problem not to be solved but a reality to be experienced."" I remember the quintessential Soren Kierkegaard quote on this. 

An object must have a concious observer for its existence to be known. Object doesn't illuminates, on its own. One who sees is the subject. What is seen in the object. There has to be a 'discrimination' between the two. 'Drg-Drisya-Viveka' as the Vedantins would say.
 When we observe our thoughts we become aware of the thoughts rising and subsiding in our mind. The one who observes all transient thoughts is the subject. The thoughts are the object. There has to be a discrimination between the two. Which essentially suggests, I am not my thought. 
 Now, can I touch my tip of the tongue, with my own tip of the tongue? Oh no way! Likewise the Seer cannot be seen. It will always be the Subject and never be the Object.

Discrimination as we had seen earlier, is the essence of language. Discrimination is dualistic. So is language. 

The flow of time is a subjective feature of the Universe, not an objective part of the physical description. We live in a world of unfolding and becoming. It is always becoming.
Our perception of time’s flow depends entirely on our inability to see the universe in all its detail. 

Let us believe I just clapped. From an objective point it is an event of course. But if we care to observe closely, the so called event had started from the point, when I thought, I will clap. Then cognitively prepared for the clap, then the clapping happened - the eventual moment of two palms banged together to make the sound, /klap/. Maybe the so called event of clap had started way earlier, when I had just thought of writing this down and was looking for an analogy to explain. Even if I go to the extent of saying this clap was in due process, since I had taken birth. Would it be wrong?

Shouldn't our birthdays be celebrated on the day we were conceived rather than the day of delivery! A good ten months in advance. 

Now let us look upon space. What is the extent of my physical self. Till the farthest end of my longest body hair? Why is it not my smell? Till the extent the pheromones reach!

We have arbitrarily agreed upon all of these situations, how big a thing is and how long an event is simply a matter of definition. Going by the words of Allan Watts. 

'Arbitrarily agreed upon'... Aha! Birthday is celebrated on the day of delivery. Just for the convenience of it. Otherwise it is difficult to exactly pin point the day of actual birth. 

Now let us once again go back to the 'event of clapping' if we don't see the point of collision between the two palms. The sound would appear to have appeared out of nothing/silence. Now if we carefully observe the sound. It began with a sound /klap/. Then the  sound decays in a short while (Imagine the the residual /pppp/). Finally, before being submerged into the silence again. Can we accept that as different sections of one continues happening. Doesn't that essentially say that past present and future is also a concept that is agreed upon, for convenience and not an actual reality. 

Convenience! Language too is a matter of convenience. 'Arbitrarily agreed upon' system of communication but horribly limited. Time to invent a better system, I guess.

linguistics,Theories on the origin of the word *mandu describing some sort of steamed dumpling and the dumpling itself?,"Variations of the word (and food) stretch all across Eurasia from as far east as Japan to as far west as Eastern Europe.

But linguistically we hit a dead end at Turkic and Sinitic. The languages very clearly not related to each other, but neither language family can offer a convincing etymology of the word. In fact it almost seems like both Turkic and Sinitic also treat it as a loanword. The word is not able to be decomposed into any smaller morphological units in either language (barring an obviously false folk etymology in Sinitic), but it seems implausible for any language to have such a specific thing as part of basic vocabulary.

I give the poster credit for saying in his opening lines that it is wrong to say a language is better or worse. Everything following that was quite hilarious to me on why French was a terrible language. He included neocolonial ""rump states"" like Niger as a reason why French is a terrible language. 

How would you respond to this guy? The post has some slight superiority/nazi tones in it. I hate the french language but I wouldn't ever give the following post as a reason. I do agree with his stance on pronunciation. I haven't detected any ""You have the wrong accent, speak like the capital!"" culture/dynamic with english speakers like is mentioned with French in regards to speaking. 

&amp;#x200B;

"" 

Better is the wrong and inaccurate way to phrase the question but people most likely stated that so I’ll just play your game.

English is less convoluted. It has utility. Conjugations are minimal in english, the grammar is simpler in terms of agreement and different conjugations for singular/plural and gender. There is no gender. You will never ask why such and such his feminine but such and such is masculine in english. You will in french. French officially has 15 tenses or so and uses maybe half of them in everyday speech.

In effect, French is two languages. The one you speak everyday and then the one you write. English does not have that problem. We have formal words, but we do not have this situation where written/academic english is almost another language. We will speak the same but maybe use more ‘high class sound words’ but nothing else changes.

English is efficient with communication. It gets its point across without all the bells and whistles of a French language. English has historically done better as a colonizer and its colonization strategy ensured the languages spread as a natively spoken language. English Colonization was big on whole population and family movement. Not just single males having concubines siring bastards which was common in non english colonies. It happened but it was not an officially and culturally sanctioned practiced and not to the levels that happened elsewhere.

The USA is english speaking natively by population characteristics. Canada is an absolute majority natively english speaking. Australia is as well. In europe, there is a native speaking english country. There are 2 in North America (excluding the Caribbean, spare me please), There are 2 in the pacific region that contains Australia and New Zealand.

These native english speaking countries excluding england and new zealand, are quiet large, and quite well off economically.

French doesn’t have that. Outside of France, what other country does that language have that you can compare to Australia, New Zealand, the USA? Canada as a whole? Quebec is part of Canada and less wealthy than english zones in general, and it isn’t independent. There are none. French colonies remain French colonies by way of FranceAfrique. They deposit their nations money in the French treasury and take ordrs from Paris. Without corrupt african countries, France and french might not exist. Without official government english speaking countries in Africa, English would still have Canada, Australia, and the USA.

The country in Africa do not speak it natively. It was and will always be a foreign language with low utility in global commerce and culture in the modern era. When we say a country is french speaking, that really isn’t the case. It is a learned language by small elite and people that are claimed to speak it can’t be confirmed to have a mastery of it. We do not know what is being considered “speaking French”. Be sure that they will inflate their numbers if you could pull off saying Bonjour and C’est dommage.

French language speakers can boast amazing nations like Niger a french colonial backwater to this day, Burkina Faso another backwater, Mauretania a backwater that still engages in Black African slavery, Congo-Kinshasa, a place labelled as a country but it is more accurate to call it a region as there is no order or law. Only the laws of chaos and basic physics exist there. It is always in a state of civil war, coup d’etats, and perpetual poverty. Madagascar a backwater, Mali, a backwater. The common theme is the countries with French as an official language are worse off. They can’t even use their own nation’s money as it is deposited in the French treasury in France. They use a currency they do not set the rules for, it is tied to the French franc in France. We can’t even call these political entities countries. They are just subsistence zones used to prop up a France economy. Haiti? It cannot even be said to be a french speaking country. More Haitians speak Spanish fluently than the small ethnically different Syrian/Lebanese communities and the historic MRE that is Morally Repugnant Elite, community. Haitians speak their own language that is not french.

So, English is a better language overall because of its utility, its simplicity and easy access to all. It is a language that does its job well. Communication. You spend more time learning complicated French than you do communicating in it. English is simpler, easier, and more egalitarian as a language. There is no Parisian inspired snobbiness to accents. All standard forms of english in their native speaking lands are accepted and respected. French? If you don’t sound like a parisian you are ridiculed.

You’d be better off communicating with USA ppl, Australia, New Zealand, England ppl, India, pakistan, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, and most countries that have a big population that uses english due to trade or the internet, than wasting your time learning french to hand out water bottles for doctors without borders and throw hand me down shirts/used clothes from a moving vehicle in a place like madagascar or Burkina faso. lol.""",1588125401,Valkyrie_Lux,5

linguistics,"This week's Q&amp;A thread -- please read before asking or answering a question! - April 27, 2020","Do you have a quick question about language or linguistics that doesn’t merit its own thread? Our weekly Q&amp;A thread is the perfect place to post them! A new Q&amp;A thread goes up every Monday, but we have people who read them regularly throughout the week.

**What counts as a “quick question”?**

Any question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: 

*Quick questions:*

* Asking for an explanation of a technical term
* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature
* Asking how we would transcribe something
* Asking how a feature works in a particular language

*Not-so-quick questions:*

* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim
* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject

If you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.

Also, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first. You may also be interested in our [**reading list**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/readinglist).

**Commenting rules**

The rules for commenting in this post are the same as for the rest of /r/linguistics. You don’t have to be a flaired user to answer questions, but we expect answers to reflect an expert level of knowledge.

**What if I didn't get an answer to my question last week?**

Your question probably wasn’t answered because no one who knew the answer saw it. This could be because you posted it soon before the new Q&amp;A thread went up, or it could be because it the answer requires specialist knowledge.  If this happens, feel free to repost your question in the new Q&amp;A thread, or to post it as a separate thread.",1587992747,AutoModerator,265

linguistics,Literary Devices Frustration," So I am studying Literary Devices in depth and I've come across a very frustrating realization in my studies. I've been learning about all of the different forms or repetition and it is getting very confusing. For example, when I came across ""anastrophe"", I found out at first that it meant the rearrangement of words from their normal order. When I did more research, I found out that it meant ""the rearrangement of words from their syntactic order"" in relation to a hyperbaton, which was ""the rearrangement of words from their idiomatic order"". Then my dad gave me a book called ""Greek Grammar"" by Herbert Smyth, and he says an ""anastrophe"" is a word that is repeated after coming at the end of one clause and starting the next. However, most dictionaries and online sources say that this is the definition of ""anadiplosis"", for which Smythe gives a different definition. My dad says all of his university professors referenced Smythe, so it'd be very difficult to say that Smythe was wrong, yet his definition of Anastrophe is different than all of the other ones in all of the other dictionaries online that say, specifically, that an anastrophe is ""the rearrangement of words from their syntactic order"". Why is there a discrepancy here? Which source is correct, Smythe or the rest of the internet? Is it possible that the meaning of ""anastrophe"" has changed since 1920, when ""Greek Grammar"" was published? Is it possible that the explanation in English cannot be translated into an explanation in Greek? Am I the first human being to discover this?

The reason this is so frustrating is because for every definition Smythe gives, its one word off from what every other dictionary source says. For example, his definition of ""anadiplosis"" is Merriam-Webster/Oxford/Wikipedia/Brigham Young's definition of ""Epizukes"", and his definition of ""anastrophe"" is Merriam-Webster/Oxford/Wikipedia/Brigham Young's definition of ""anadiplosis"".",1587910033,PrimaryDisguise,3

linguistics,Why is the diversity pattern in Japonic languages inverted ?,"In most languages families, the highest diversity is found close to the family's homeland (for example, the Austronesian languages spoken in Taiwan). 

However, the Japonic langugages seem to show the opposite pattern : while speakers first arrived to the Japanese archipelago from the Korean peninsula, this region is relatively homogeneous in terms of langugages (Japanese and Hachijō) as compared to the Ryukyu archipelago. Furthermore, in the latter, the diversity increases going south, rather than north as one would expect.

This problem is recognized in some articles, such as ""The historical position of the Ryukyuan langugages"" (Pellard 2011 : https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01682958), which puts forwards the hypothesis of a ""founder effect"", with shared innovations happening faster in isolated islands such as the Ryukyu. However, this hypothesis does not seem satisfying : these islands were in continuous contact with the Japanese mainland, and the sea seperating the islands wouldn't be much more of a problem than Japan's mountainous terrain, for example.

Is there another possible explanation ? Were there other languages spoken on the Japanese mainland, which disappeared during the unification of Japan ? Could, say, these differences stem from an unknown substratum, or would the founder effect be enough to explain them ?",1587898719,quark-nova,7

According to this theory, the truth of ""I saw a boy"" entails the truth of ""I saw a child"" because ""boy"" has all the semantic features of ""child"" plus its distinct features. But I don't think this is a general rule because the theory fail to explain this pair:

&gt;I like canary.  
&gt;  
&gt;I like bird.

Here, ""canary"" has all the semantic features of ""bird."" Thus, according to the theory, the truth of ""I like canary"" is supposed to entail the truth ""I like bird."" But this result is obviously incorrect.

In addition to my inflection, she said when I said “I’m gonna put this computer up” that phrase also helped her guess where I was from.

I’m wondering if anyone here has knowledge about how large of a region people would say “putting things up” when talking about cleaning?",1587792291,zed910,1
linguistics,Is the use of 'mommy/daddy' to refer oneself to their children an American English thing?,"I can't be the only one who does this with their kids.  I often refer to myself as 'mommy' when talking to my very young son, and my husband refers to himself as 'daddy'.  As in: 'Can you give mommy what you have in your hand?' 'Can you give mommy a hug?' 'Mommy needs some space, please', etc. I know there's a lot of research on child-directed speech, but I'm not sure if this is part of it.",1587791731,GirlLunarExplorer,4
linguistics,Help with African Languages,"Hello everyone, I was wondering if you guys could help me with a little thing I was doing. I wanted to chart the language families of the world but I'm struggling with Africa. Since Africa has indigenous languages and colonial languages, I'm struggling to choose which one is more important to each country. I wanted to do the majority of speakers of a language group. For example, a Bantu language has 30% of the population speak it and another Bantu language has 30% of the population speak it, but English has 50% of speakers, the country would still be Bantu. I want the country to be represented by the vehicular languages, not just what the government uses. Would you guys change any one of these countries?

Green is Semitic, Brown is Cushitic, Gray is Nilo-Saharan, Salmon Pink is Niger-Congo, blue is Bantu, Light Pink is Austronesian (Orange is Romance, Red is Germanic). Would you argue that any of these countries have a much stronger preference for the colonial language? Like Angola, which I believe has a high amount of Portuguese speakers (but I'm not very sure). Also, did I classify each country correctly? Thank you.

linguistics,Is there any convincing evidence in CogSci for the idea that either production or comprehension has a more prominent role in language processing?,"What I want to know is whether thesis (1), (2) or (2) are backed up by substantial evidence or if there is a consensus among psycholinguists and cognitive scientists on this matter.

(1) **Production has a relative primacy over comprehension.** In order to understand speech we need to have some semblance of the motor plan that produced the relevant acoustic signal.

(2) **Comprehension has a relative primacy over production.** In order to produce speech we need to have some rough acoustic analysis of the acoustic signal the motor plan would produce.

(3) **Neither has relative primacy.** There is an amodal level of representation of language that is accessed both by comprehension and production subsystems.",1587775264,pseudogapping,1
linguistics,"Why Does British English Refer to the Ground as the ""Floor?""","I'm an American who loves English Premier League soccer. I'm a massive Liverpool F.C. fan. When watching an E.P.L. game if a player is fouled and is knocked to the field the British TV announcers say he is down on the ""floor"" despite the fact they are playing outside. In American English the term ""floor"" is reserved for inside. Outside, I would never say a player was knocked to the ""floor."" I would say ""field,"" ""pitch,"" or ""ground."" I wonder why the difference in word usage and how British folks use ""floor"" vs ""ground."" Thank you in advance for your imput! YNWA.",1587773703,VanDijkLFC777,11

linguistics,Bella go to the pouch,"The purpose of this post is not to assert that dogs possess any sort of language faculty- I know how touchy linguists are about that sort of thing. 

My dog “knows” about 4 words- couch (ie go to the couch!), eat (wanna eat?), out, sit, etc. 

If I say 

“Go to the cow” or “go to the cowp” she won’t budge. 

“Go to the sofa” she won’t budge. 

If I say 

“Go to the louch” she goes to the couch. 

I’ve played similar games saying Zella (almost her name), grout (like out), etc. and she responds to rhyming words! 

Does this say anything about joe ears work? 

Is an English speaker more likely to recognize/ confuse rhyming words than other nearly similar words in another language? 

Do mandarin “speaking” dogs confuse words based on tone? 

Spanish and Italian seem to rhyme more often than most other languages. Are these dogs confused all the time?

linguistics,Was the transatlantic entirely ‘artificial’?,"I’ve seen quite a few linguists describe the transatlantic/mid-atlantic accent, as one that was entirely *acquired* by being taught to film/radio people, or at elite boarding schools. But presumably after a time, the children of the elites picked it up somewhat naturally? 

Would someone like FDR/Jackie Kennedy/Katherine Hepburn not just speak like this because that’s how their parents/social circle spoke, or was it purely through being taught at school? If it was acquired in all these cases, do we have any idea of how they would have talked prior to elocution?",1587766829,anonymous1447,4

linguistics,Reading recommendations - Generative Syntax,"Hi friends!  
I'm looking to get read up on Generative Syntax. I know that I could get a decent understanding through textbooks, but I'd like to start by reading the books and papers from 1960 onward that were essential to the development of current understandings of Generative Syntax. I'm reading *Aspects of the Theory of Syntax* (Chomsky) now, and I'm planning on reading *Lectures on Government and Binding.* What other books and papers would you recommend? I'd like to read at least five books and thirty papers, and I'd like to at least understanding x-bar theory and the minimalist program.",1587765656,JediMastaYogurt,6
