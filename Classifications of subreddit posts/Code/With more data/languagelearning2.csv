languagelearning,The Language Learning Journey: Tips From a Polyglot,"**A bit about me**

I currently speak four languages and I’ve been writing comments lately here on reddit. I wanted to share some hard-earned tips.

The languages that I speak as non-native are all European: English, German, and Italian in that order of fluency. I have reached in all of them least C1. My native language is Spanish. I am currently learning Russian, but it is extremely basic. I probably reached the equivalent of A2/B1 in Japanese but gave up on it.

**How to learn a language?**

This guide is as general as possible so that it can be used for other languages. It is my method. It has worked for me through the years and hope that some things might be useful to you. Obviously not everything will work for you, but you might find one or two useful things. This guide assumes that you want to reach fluency, and who doesn’t? isn’t that the purpose of learning a new language?

I usually invest 40 to 60 minutes daily! Yes daily, including birthdays, vacations, and holy days. I break it down into 20 minutes segments. But this is heavily dependent on your target and native language. Trust me once you get used to it, it stops being a chore.

**A1 and A2**

At these levels, the motivation is high, and the learning is fast paced. I usually learn A1 by myself. For me, if I pass A1 alone it means that I am willing to commit to the language-learning journey. Knowing myself, if I don’t survive A1 alone it means that I won’t commit to the language in the long run. So, I don’t invest in teachers. Just not yet. I have stopped learning languages at this stage and realized that is not for me. And it makes sense if you think about it. Most of the language, if you want to reach fluency, you will learn it alone. Teacher represents a support role, not your only source of learning.

During A1 I usually play Duolingo as a complement to a textbook. I choose a book with recordings and repeat after the words. Again, I do not talk to any natives during A1. Also, during this stage, I work consciously on pronouncing, to the best of my knowledge, all syllable combinations. I look for books for self-learners and most are helpful with this. If not, look for YouTube videos. Start early with a good pronunciation! Do not butcher the language!

I cannot state these enough times: Focus on training your mouth, throat, tongue, lips, nose (this last if learning French). If you are not pronouncing the language correctly when talking to natives, they will switch to English, hindering your progress. (Here culture plays a role as well, some cultures are more tolerant and accommodate to foreigners when speaking, but hey! if they do decide to switch, it wasn’t because you were mispronouncing their language)

Once I reach A2 I look for a teacher because I have proven myself. But what have I proven? Well, a certain level of commitment with minimal risk and investment. If you realize you don’t like it dump it. At times you will only find out by having tried. It happened to me with Chinese and French.

**B1 and B2**

Here the motivation starts to dwindle and the progress plateaus. Like the middle of a book, you struggle to keep going. Here your determination will be tested the most. You will feel that on top of learning, you will also have to keep yourself from forgetting! You might feel overwhelmed because you are studying as hard but not really seeing much progress like the beginning.

Here, to keep my motivation, I stop using Duolingo and switch to Anki. I love Duolingo but the repetitiveness drives me crazy and by now I usually start making mistakes out of carelessness. Also by now, I have probably finished most of the course (at least one crown or two) on Duolingo.

Just don’t forget Anki for vocabulary (or Duolingo if you still decide to stick to it). I use Anki while waiting in line, or at those moments where a “normal” person would browse through social media.

But don’t despair! this is where the fun begins! Jump into video games of your target language to keep the fun going.

On this level I emphasize on making learning enjoyable because it is where motivation is the lowest. So, play to learn. I usually play story driven games with a lot of dialogue. The first playthrough I do it in English and then switch it to my target language. Games I can recommend are RPGs. Even if you think these games are not really that good, it is for learning purposes. I choose RPG games over anything else because you must read your choices. In the game, you might go on a murder rampage, but you wouldn’t want to say the wrong thing and offend someone? Would you?

If you are still adamant about not playing those games, try switching the language of your FPS. The point is to work and play in your target language. Also, see movies in their original language.

But don’t forget to keep studying. Even though you are starting to have fun, do not overdo it. Even when playing write down interesting phrases. Keep studying for your classes and vocab with Anki. Also don’t forget to repeat tricky phrases. Yes, I do repeat out loud certain tricky phrases. You must keep practicing pronunciation.

Don't give up, this stage could last one or two years. Hell, it can reach up to three or four years, depending. the important thing is to keep going.

Around this level I switch my phone to my target language. You must start immersing yourself in the language.

By the way, if you are thinking about travelling and doing a language immersion, I would wait for B1 or B2 level so you can reap the most benefit. If you’ve reached level B, you can reward yourself with a small vacation in a country of your target language. Or step it up a notch, and if you are committed enough why not throw in a week or two of courses? At least I would do it.

**C1 and beyond**

At this level I would call myself fluent. I just don’t feel confident at B2. You could argue that because during A1 I don’t speak with a natives, I've shot myself in the foot. But by focusing on training and articulating the desired sounds since day 0, I’ve been complimented on my pronunciation many times! Which is far better that being “fluent” hastily and butchering the pronunciation.

At the beginning of C1 you can start enjoying and consuming native-level content without that much of an effort. By now the language has consolidated but sadly the newness is lost. It can turn a bit stale because there is no newness.

You might feel like an imposter, and that you do not deserve the trophy. But you do, you deserve every bit of it. Enjoy it you’ve made it. You are one of the few and should be proud. You can probably say the same thing in multiple ways. And by now, you can start playing around with the language which is an awesome feeling.

Enjoy the new view atop. A new language is a new point of view. Just maintain the level! which is certainly easier than learning it.

Since I love reading I usually read the best literature available from the greatest minds of the language.

**C1+ plus A1**

If you haven’t have suffered enough in your previous language, and are thinking about suffering anew, I have an extra tip for you.

Start a new language in your recently fluent language. When I passed the C1 test in German I started with Italian. You are essentially doing two things at once, reviewing and using your old language and learning a new one. All in one.

If your language starts turning stale at B, learn another one as a complement at this level. But only to review your material. Don't focus too much on grammar on the newest language. Just vocabulary as review for the future language and for your current target language.

languagelearning,Language Learning Experience - Spanish,"I have been learning Spanish for around two years now, and here are some of my thoughts.

Spanish is hard for me! But I love it. I constantly am watching language learning videos, and everyone seems to mention is how easy Spanish is compared to all other languages. This may be true, but it is still a large undertaking.
 
Now I’ll give you a quick rundown as to what I have done so far:

I have read around 4 books in Spanish. 
I have listened to 100 hours of Spanish audiobooks.
I have watched 300 hours of Spanish TV.
I have taken around 20 tutoring lessons.

My conversational skills are still pretty poor, but my comprehension is improving.

My goals are:
Read 95 books in Spanish.
Listen to 2000 hours in Spanish (this can be audiobooks, podcasts, or TV)

When I reach these goals I will write up the details of how I did so. I hope to do this within 5 years (3 years from now!) My big focus going forward will be reading, listening, and finding a language exchange partner.

I’m interesting in everyone’s experiences, so if there are any fellow Spanish learners, let me know!",1625531308,Fantastic_Display442,16

languagelearning,"Don't let ""It takes an average of 10 years to become fluent in any language"" demotivate you","Hey Reader, I am not trying to attack anyone. I understand that the above statement is based on scientific findings, and quantified averages.

 I would like to tell you why you shouldn't care.

Learning a language will take as long as it takes! I know people who have been studying Japanese for 5 years and still aren't confident enough to have a conversation. I also know people who have studied Mandarin for 1 year, and are now basically fluent (HSK-5 completed). Here is why they had such drastically different results.

1. Method of study: The person studying Japanese wasted all of their time playing Japanese games and simple language learning applications. They only used resources that they found comfortable and somewhat enjoyable. The Mandarin learner spent 1 year in China, where they participated in an intense language program. The program forced them to spend many hours per day going over ""boring"" materials. These bland exercises and repetitive lessons were actually extremely effective. The Mandarin learner never really used any ""fun"" resources.
2. Exposure to the culture. The Japanese learner had never been to Japan. This isn't really a big problem, but they also never even **spoke** to another person in Japanese. This is a heavy contrast relative to the Mandarin learner who spent 1 year in China. I realize not everyone has the ability to travel to randomly based on the language they are trying to learn. But you need to at least seek out people in their community or online who they can practice with.
3. Actual time spent studying. I feel like too many people will do 30 minutes of Duolingo then watch 6 hours of subbed anime and feel like they have had a good day studying Japanese. I'm sorry to tell you, but that time probably equates to about 45 minutes of actual study. This is because Duolingo, watching TV shows, etc, don't really require you to use your entire brain. This is really evident when we compare to the Mandarin learner. They were spending a minimum of 5 hours per day doing intense studying. This means, writing down characters, using a dictionary to read a book, writing down poetry, etc. These types of activities are much more difficult, and require you to focus much more on what you are doing.

I think the amount of time it takes to learn x language is mainly determined by your willingness to study diligently. I understand that most people cannot move to France just because they want to learn French. However, if you had 1 year to become fluent in French or else you would die. I can guarantee you would become fluent. 

TLDR: Learning a language is determined by what you are willing to sacrifice. How much time can you sacrifice? How much money can you sacrifice? How much energy can you sacrifice? 

Guys I really don't mean to offend or discredit anyone. I just want to give some people confidence. My main point is: You can learn a language as fast as you want, don't let averages demotivate you.",1625516764,quickdr4w_,117

languagelearning,"Pick your languages very carefully, because your total active languages can't exceed 4, realistically speaking.","By active language I mean a language you can use at a B2 level without prior revision. 

Your total active languages can't exceed 4, here are 2 reasons:

1. Time limit. It takes 10 years of active study to get to a point where you can express yourself clearly. In other words, it takes 40 years minimum to learn 4 languages to fluency. That's half of your whole life already, and this is assuming you dedicate most of your time towards languages, which is impossible for most people. 
2. Language interference. The more languages you learn, the more severe the interference. This is simply a natural, unavoidable phenomenon. If you don't put in active effort keeping apart your languages, you're going to mix up so much grammar and words, no native speakers from any languages would understand you. 

I can list more reasons, but let's stop here. Pick your languages wisely. You only have 4 tries.",1625514135,LanguageIdiot,14

languagelearning,How can I prevent people giving me unsolicited corrections?,"This is probably an unpopular stance among language learners but I hate being corrected and find it somewhat rude. It's annoying when you are having a conversation with someone and suddenly they feel the need to correct what I said. It takes me out of the flow of the conversation and makes me feel a bit crappy that the other person wasn't listening to what I was saying and instead just focusing on my mistakes. Most of the time when I speak, I know when I make mistakes and I don't need it pointed out to me. Half the time too the corrections I receive aren't even correct and it just shows that the native speaker doesn't understand the rules of their own language.

I think ultimately though its just rude to correct someone when they haven't asked to be corrected and when the conversation is about something completely unrelated. So, is there any way this can be dealt with? I do try and ask people not to correct me but it doesn't have much effect?

With the recent absence of Covid + my increase confidence, I have started developing relationships with so many amazing Chinese speakers. Everyone I met has been super friendly, and I have been getting many invitations to visit!!! I can't wait to come to China in 2023!!! 我想去中国 !

languagelearning,How far do you scroll down to find a teacher on italki and other platforms?,"I'm a community tutor on italki, teaching both my native language and English. When I first started (April/May), my profile is always on the 6-8 page and I doubt anyone really saw it then.  


For my native language, I only started getting students (most of them take classes on grammar and sentence construction and only 1 took conversation practice) in June. There was a time when my profile was on the first page (but only for a day). Most of the time, it was on the 2nd or 3rd page. Now (and last week), it's on the 4th page and it was even on the 5th page yesterday.  


For English, I also had my first students (conversational classes) in June. The first one asked if I can offer discounts (it's already $5 for one class and $25 for 5 classes, the lowest possible rates on italki). With this in mind, I thought that he probably saw my profile only after filtering for low prices. I don't often check my profile visibility as an English teacher. But when I do, I NEVER see it (not even after 20 pages and not even after filtering for less than $10 lol). Anyway, it must have been on the first or second page at least once if they were able to find me but I never saw it myself.  


My rating is just 4.9 stars and I wonder if this is the reason. I also read that frequent log-ins and more available hours are the key but I don't think it's those things either.  


My question for students: How far do you scroll down to find a teacher on italki and other platforms? Do you dig deeper if you're taking an actual lesson and dig less if you're just looking for a conversation partner?",1625464990,revesdemarie,13

###Journal entries

**Monday** Today was the first day of my second attempt, I retained more words than I thought I would, but I think my ability to tell where one word ends and the other begins has gotten worse.
The only thing I've read today is a comicbook called One Piece, which I've already seen in Japanese. Reading is far easier than listening, 
I think I leant more in today's 7 hours than in the 30 hours of my previous attempt. 
After experimenting with different things, by the end of the day I had found the adaptation of this comicbook in Spanish, with subtitles that match most of the time. 
I think these will be my main source of input. I may be digging myself into a corner by relying too much on reading, but I hope my listening will catch up after I get better.
As for how conscious I am of my acquisiton, I'm unsure, I'm making guesses all the time, cocerning both words and grammar structures.
For example a verb conjugating to end in 'a' is probably some form of imperative (mira, espera etc.)
However I think I've also acquired the skill to tell nouns and verbs apart to some degree, I have no conscious conjectures about this, some words just sound verb-like and others more noun-like.

**Tuesday**
Reading is suprisingly enjoyable even though I'm not understanding most of it. Yesterday there was an interesting effect that may have occured because of my experience with Japanese.
You see, when I was learning Japanese, sometimes when I encountered a word that I didn't know, but I could guess it's reading I still got that 'Hooray new word understood' feeling, 
despite not actually understanding it. I think this might have tricked my brain, because I was getting this feeling all the time becuse of the phonetic spellings. It wore off this morning.
It was still enjoyable though. Listening however is extremely demoralizing it's mostly gibberish, I can't detect the words that I'm half-familiar with from reading,
but there is no way they aren't there. Reading gives me hope that I could actually learn reasonably fast, but listening seems impossible.


**Wednesday**
I got tired a lot quicker than I thought I would, listening takes almost no effort, but reading is suprisingly taxing, I can't read for longer than 4 hours a day.
I'm not sure if this is simply because reading is harder than listening even for one's NL or if it's because my brain is working harder trying to decipher the language.
Also, I may not be getting enough sleep, I'll try and see if getting up at 7:30 instead of 6:30 and taking fewer brakes to compensate for it, makes the situation better or worse.
I also take back what I said about the imperative, it apears to be much more complex. Verbs seem to have tenses similar to English 
and they definetly conjugate depending on the subject and object like they do in Hungarian.


**Thursday**
I was very optimistic for the first 3 days, I was learning much faster than expected, I thought there would be more of a snowball effect, 
where I would not understand anything for a long time, but that then it would speed up, however pogress feels suprisingly linear, which actually makes me quite worried.
If the rate at which I'm leaning doesn't speed up then I'm not sure that it will be fast enough to reach an OK level.


**Friday**
There are a number of words that I recognise now, but have no idea what they mean. The two that irritate me the most right now are abaco(not sure if I wrote that correctly)
and cosa, I think I figured out earlier today that the latter may mean thing but I'm not sure. I feel like this is the situation where a dictionary would prove most useful.
I have also found a comicbook that's easier than One Piece, called Yotsuba to. It's incredible how easy it is. I think I'll put off reading One Piece.


**Saturday**
It appears that what I thought of as abaco was actually two different verbs abac??? and acab???. My current guess is that the former means finish and the later means die.
Which is weird because I can't tell if there is a difference between that and morir. Anyways, I have made and revised many guesses for a lot words, so it's still possible that
these guesses still aren't correct.


**Sunday**
I just heard someone use the word 'nada' in an English video about finding pack.png in Minecraft. Luckily I had already known what it meant, so it didn't teach me anything,
but it did lower my motivation a little bit, what if everything I've learned so far is so basic that every American knows it because they live next to Mexico and it's just common knowledge,
like the way it is here in Hungary with a few words of German, and apperantly as 'nada' is. Sure I'm learning, but I have no idea if it's fast enough. 
Though this is not a problem unique to this method, I've always taken what I already know for granted, but it still feels bad. On the bright site, today I clicked on a random manga that the site
I use to read Yotsuba recommended to me because I thought it would be ridiculous based on the title: ¿Qué se debe hacer durante la pandemia de coronavirus? It was like twelve pages long,
but it felt so good to just open something random and understand most of what it was saying.

If it is something I already internalized, like ""konnichiwa"" or ""otsukare"" the meaning is instantly apparent.

If it's something I don't know, my brain can easily skip over it.

However, these sentences I sorta know, but not well enough, exhausts my brain. In a sense, it's more than what I can comfortably understand. I know all the words in the sentence, but because I don't know them well enough, it takes my brain effort to figure it out.

So, like, maybe after a hard day at work and you're tired, your brain shuts off. Like that, after parsing too many sentences like that, my brain just skips over it if it decides that it's too hard.

What I want to know is if this is natural? What should I do? Should I keep parsing them? Or should I just notice, but skip trying to figure  them out like my brain would do with grammar or words I don't know?

Maybe it's too hard for a reason, kinda like i+1 but i is what I can comfortably understand? Like, the sentence just isn't worth it at this point in time?

languagelearning,Confused between what language to learn...,"Hey /r/languagelearning ! I hope you're all well.

I'm a 21 year old dude in university. I've grown up speaking a couple different languages thanks to moving around frequently. I speak about 5 languages, but none of them fluently. The one I know most of just happens to be English, because I use it on a daily basis.

Now, I'm conflicted between learning Spanish and Russian. I learned Spanish in high school (I got to B2), but that was 3 years ago. Now I can have *basic* conversations, and if something is written down, I can have a guess at the meaning of what's written. 

I've also always been fascinated by Russian stuff, and my best friend is Russian, and he said he'd be willing to help me out if necessary. I can already read and write cyrillic (albeit not knowing wtf it is that I'm reading/writing), because I attempted to learn Russian when I was about 15 as well.

I do want to learn both languages, but I'm really conflicted on whether I should start from square one with Russian, or basically around the same level with Spanish, in which progression would be a lot quicker due to me already having learnt it before. I do pick up languages quickly, and my goal by the end of the year is to be able to have at least basic conversations in either one, which I think is doable. The University I'm attending also has some Spanish and Russian speaking faculty. I've spoken in broken Spanish with one of my professors, and he helped me out here and there.

What do I go with? I'm so confused lol.

languagelearning,A step-by-step method for learning foreign vocabularies easier," To all language learners,

learning a new language takes time and can be frustrating. One of the most important parts of learning a new language are vocabularies. It’s probably the most time-consuming part. There are many language apps, but surprisingly there are very few tools that focuses on vocabulary learning. 

Vocabulary learning has accompanied me intensively for about 4 years. During my study, I had to learn about 600 new vocabularies for an exam within 3 months. Now I have been working for two years as an engineer in a position where I constantly have to confront new technical terms in a foreign language. After some literature research, I will summarize the best method which works the best.

**The most efficient method to store vocabulary into the long-term memory**

In general, the more ways a memory can be encoded, the greater the likelihood that it will be accessible for later retrieval. “Storing a memory in multiple representational modes — such as words, images, and sounds —provides more retrieval cues to bring it back to mind” (Paivio)[\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/submit#_ftn1). So, after some research we have figured out that the following methods are key factors when it comes to an efficient learning strategy to acquire vocabulary:

1. Acoustic Perception

It is essential to hear the vocabulary pronounced aloud. The pronunciation should be voiced by a native speaker. “Learners at a low-proficiency level appeared to register vocabulary in memory more by sound similarities than by related meanings; high-proficiency learners relied on associated meanings rather than sound similarities.” (Henning)[\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/submit#_ftn2)

2. Visual Representation

Visual representation as a picture will increase the likelihood to store the vocabulary into one’s memory. Teachers all over the world use visual materials such as pictures or real objects to teach new words making the learning process more enjoyable and memorable. (see Harmer)[\[3\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/submit#_ftn3)

3. Semantic Encoding

Information that has a particular meaning or context is processed in a way that is called semantic encoding. Concepts, Ideas, and terms are some examples of semantic information. The semantically encoded information is relatively easy to be retrieved. By learning a word within a context ties brain actions to crating patters that have meaning. (see Tulving)[\[4\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/submit#_ftn4)

4. Active Recall

Reading and learning a vocabulary once is not enough to save it into one’s long-term memory. By active recalling the vocabulary again and again it gets stored into your memory. “Continuous active learning achieves high recall for technology-assisted review” (Cormack)[\[5\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/submit#_ftn5).

5. Spaced repetition

Reading and trying to memorize a vocabulary once isn’t enough. You have to repeat the vocabulary again and again until it is stored in your long-term memory. While repeating a vocabulary it is important to find the proper time interval between each repetition. If there is too less time between each repetition, the word does not reach the long-term memory and stays in the short-term memory. Having too much time between each repetition it may happen that you won’t remember the word at all. So timing is key. (see, Kang)[\[6\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/submit#_ftn6)

A friend and me decided to develop a vocabulary trainer to help other people to learn vocabulary more efficient. We are working on a software that includes all above mentioned methods to provide an efficient way to store the vocabulary into the brain. Our vision is to create the most effective and time-efficient vocabulary trainer on the market. Together we built a small team and created Learnee. You can use it for free and without any advertisement. Give us your feedback and let’s improve this tool together J

**We support the community of language learners**

Learnee can also be seen as a platform to exchange self-created dictionaries. Someone in the US who is learning for example for a B1-Japanese test will probably learn the same vocabulary as a German who prepared for the B1-Japanese test one year ago. Over Learnee it is feasible to exchange the vocabulary lists between students. Basically, this idea can be extended to any subject. Medical students can exchange anatomy terms and biologist can exchange structural formula of molecules. From learners for learners.

The huge advantage of building up such a community is to only create a learning list once which can be shared amongst others. As a result, due to the high reuse grade of work, that was done by other students, a lot of time can be saved. 

**Where to get Learnee?**

Currently, we are offering a free beta version for Windows, you can download it on our homepage ([https://learnee.de](https://learnee.de/)). Feel free to give us feedback on Learnee!

languagelearning,Can learning a new language negatively affect your abilities in a different language,"I have some German ancestry and for this reason I was always attracted to the German space and culture, and spent a bit of effort to learn German to the point where I had a nearly perfect language comprehensions (I was reading a lot of books, listening to shows in German, participating in German online communities etc). I can also express myself without difficulties but it is still obvious I'm not a native speaker because I didn't practice this a lot.   


My native tongue is another European language that's completely unrelated and irrelevant to the question at hand.   


Now, I find myself needing to interact with Dutch people and Dutch knowledge would come really handy in my present situation. So I started reading some phrasebooks, and textbooks on Dutch. I realized that it's extremely similar to German to the point that I understand say 60-70% of written Dutch exclusively based on my German knowledge (Pronunciation is a bit more different but not something that can't be acquired in a few months to a decent level). Now here is my problem. Because I don't use a lot of German in my day to day life, and because Dutch forms are so similar to German, I feel that learning Dutch will hinder my German language abilities.

“I have to write an essay”

I constantly chat with friends who don’t speak my native language, have no problems with having a conversation with someone I don’t know, can write stuff like this post easily and get lots of content in English like podcasts or videos. But I’m very unsatisfied with my vocabulary. I always notice new words here and there and people often use words that I don’t know (and have never encountered before and I have to ask to explain every time). I feel stuck on this level of most common words that doesn’t let me get into anything more advanced. But I also can’t overcome the fear of reading a whoooole book in English (my interest in literature is chaotic, I either read nonstop or touch a book once in a few months, so books aren’t always an option) or watching a movie. Maybe not leaving my comfort zone by avoiding more difficult content leads to being surrounded only with familiar words, so I don’t see new ones often enough to actually pick them up and have in my vocabulary. But if I do decide to read or watch something, there are way too many new words and I don’t know what to do with them. Should I just look them up and keep reading/watching? If I do, will they stay in my memory? Should I write them down? Or maybe should I make flashcards? I tried using them but gave up after a while, not my thing. Or use any other ways of memorizing vocabulary? Or will words stick naturally?

I think it wouldnt be as hard if my ability to communicate verbally was better, right now i know my pronunciation is horrible and its a lot harder for me to conjure up sentences verbally than written. Its infuriating though because the only way ill really improve that is by practicing.

languagelearning,What is the deal with ESL learners and the TV show Friends?,"Let me just preface this by saying I have never watched the show besides one episode before writing this post. I fully admit that there might be more that I am not seeing, and would just like to learn more.

It seems like the 90s sitcom *Friends* is popular all over the world...except mostly with non-native English speakers? I don’t personally know anybody from the US who still talks about that show, and yet it seems that so many people, young and old, from various (non-English speaking) countries across the world still watch and cherish it. 

I just honestly would like to know what the appeal is. I just watched one episode, as I said, and from my point of view, it’s just a generic, kind of boring 90s sitcom. Things that I think might be a factor are:

-the dialog is not that fast paced or complicated;

-it will give you some cultural knowledge, but isn’t as laden with constant pop culture references as something like, say, Family Guy;

-contains slightly edgy plots involving sex and relationships (appealing to children/teenagers);

-it’s from the 90s, so still modern-ish (not like watching a TV show from the 60s or something);

-has a shitload of episodes to binge, which in turn will let you grow close to the main cast of characters and want to continue watching to see what happens to them.

IDK, I’m just kind of baffled, because from my point of view, if you’re going to watch a 90s sitcom, *Seinfeld* is probably one of the greatest TV shows ever made, LOL.",1625220905,PeanutOpposite,123

languagelearning,Does anyone else find that when they’ve reached a C1 level in a language that it becomes a bit “boring”?,"I don’t know why but ever since I’ve reached a solid C1 level especially in listening and reading, it no longer feels exciting to me that I know French. 

Before, anything I did in the language gave me so much excitement and made the activity feel really special and something I looked forward to because it felt *French* and by that I guess it felt like something that I had not yet achieved and something that I had maybe romanticised.

However, now it just feels like a language I’ve known all my life, nothing special just like my native languages. When I watch/read something in French it’s no longer exciting or special; the material doesn’t seem “French” to me anymore in that I only see/hear/read the actual story. It’s just like watching something in English. Nothing special, something that was always part of my life. 

So now when it comes to picking French or English content I find myself gravitating toward English content because I find more of it much more compelling and of better quality than French content (personal preference).

Plus, to seek that excitement again, I find myself wanting to learn another language *even though I hated the “learning” and grinding part of language learning*. I don’t know maybe becoming “fluent” was underwhelming when I actually achieved it.

languagelearning,Learning a language is similar to learning to code,"You start off learning the vocabulary and syntax of the program by going through various tutorials. Most of what you learn at this point doesn't stick but you have a general understanding. It is when you start to write your own program that you start putting it all together and start the real learning process which is usually quite frustrating and sometimes overwhelming. Similarly, when learning a language we learn the vocabulary and grammar to some extent and then we go into immersion which often teaches us how little we know in terms of using the language in the real world. Some daring souls jump immediately into immersion but for me this would be overwhelming unless I'm living in the  target country and surrounded by people that know way more than I do.",1625177946,kodi412,17

languagelearning,"I’m (nearly) 22, can I reach a decent level of fluency in French &amp; Mandarin by 25-27?","Background:

I’ll be 22 this month. I still need 1.5 years of college (I’ll need an extra semester) and I’m majoring in International Studies with a focus on the Middle East and Asia. I am beginning my minor in French (it was going to be mandarin, but they stopped offering it by ending their partnership with another local college that had it). However, I took mandarin for two years in high school (ages 15 &amp; 16). My school also had a lot of international students (mainly from China) so one of my best friends during high school was a Chinese international student. Also, my brother has lived in Europe (Germany) for well over a decade &amp; is fluent in French &amp; German. 

Okay main part:

I always had a rather negative mindset &amp; often got discouraged while learning a new language (I’d think things like, “what’s the point?” Or “I’ll never become fluent, it’s too much!”). However, I had an epiphany recently where l realized that I could’ve easily been fluent in at least one other language by now if only I had put my mind to it. And that I spend so much time focusing on useless politics &amp; YouTube drama, when I could spend that time learning a skill like French and/or Mandarin. 

So, I’ve been taking language seriously for the past couple of weeks (not much time, I know. However, for me, that’s a big feat as I’m not good with consistency in learning.) I decided to focus on French until I reach B2-C1, then I’ll pick up mandarin again. I’m trying to set realistic expectations, so I don’t expect to be as fluent in mandarin as I will be in French, being a native English speaker (American).

Here’s my plan:

Spend my last 1.5-2 years of university minoring in French. Meanwhile, also using language apps, watching French youtubers, movies, shows, etc. Also, conversing with my brother in French as much as possible (which won’t be often, since he’s very busy, across the ocean in Europe, only visits for a few weeks every year, and I don’t get to speak to him often). Immediately after college, I’d like to do a 3-6 month immersion program in France (I am saving up). Do you think, after all of this, I could reach B2-C1 in French? If I do reach that level by that point in time, I will start learning Mandarin again &amp; possibly take an immersion program for that as well. As I have said, I’m saving up right now, so that I can take a “gap year” directly after college, where I mainly be focusing on language learning (I think this could be extremely beneficial in the job market and I also just have always wanted to become trilingual). Do you think I could reach a decent level of fluency in these languages in the next 3-5 years? Do you think this “gap year” idea is good or should I learn in a different way (while jumping right into a career)? Any advice, tips, opinions, information on immersion programs, etc. is appreciated!

languagelearning,How long does it actually take to get through level B1.1 in Spanish?,"Hi guys. I posted here a little while ago about my intensive course ([Frustrated by my intensive course : languagelearning (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/n6wedm/frustrated_by_my_intensive_course/) ). I've been trying to truck along and just make the best out of a bad situation, but in just two months I've experienced a lot of burn out and frustration. (Side note to anyone thinking of coming to Barcelona to do a language course: don't make my mistake; go to Camino, go to Camino, go to Camino!!!!)

So in the last two months, I've been taking a B1.1 course. I was really worried about being in this level, because I taught myself A1 and had only briefly done what I thought was A2. I did the placement test, and they immediately got back to me to say I needed to be in a B1 course. So I started the course, and after getting over my initial fear of making a mistake, I started to realise that this is really not my level (i.e., I probably should have been put in a higher level). It seems like I 'accidentally' learned the tenses that they were going to teach us in this course, and the last two months have essentially been revision. I've learned a lot, but I've also spent countless hours with students who don't know basic words like 'castillo' and other students who use Google Translate in class. 

I emailed the school to ask if there were any other classes that I could attend at a different time, because I'm trying to do another few hours of Spanish classes that actually focus on speaking practice (which we are getting very little of in this class). I asked if there was the possibility to move up to B1.2, because I have effectively done 160 hours (20 hrs/week for 8 weeks) in B1.1 as well as a lot of study outside and almost full days' worth of exposure to the language in other contexts. We also, this week, finished the B1.1 workbook. I took a level test on the internet the other day to track my progress, and the test came back as a B2, which I was super proud of because I attribute the grades to the fact that I've recently been teaching myself the subjunctive.

However, they are refusing to let me move up to B1.2 at all. They essentially told me that it is too big of a jump, and that I would lose out on too many classroom hours. I have tried reasoning with them, but they just won't let me move up, or even take their standard level test to prove that I have the level to move up. I'm so frustrated, because I'm stuck here and I'm trying to make this situation less terrible for myself, but everything I've tried to do they've shot down.

TL;DR: I've done a B1.1 course for 160 classroom hours, and many outside hours, but my (crappy) language school says I'm not ready to move on to B1.2. Is this right?",1625154477,GiddyZidi,6

We have lots of big goals we want to accomplish together and over the next few years we want get to know each other very very well.

We've discussed that after a few years into our relationship we'd like to add another language which we've decided we will call spanish (we might add an e or something to the end of the name if it's a girl). French, and eventually Spanish will be the most important languages in my life and I'm very excited about that.

Here's the problem though. More recently, I find this language Japanese has been catching my eye. I can't say I want to have a serious relationship with it but I'm curious about how japanese is so different than french and Spanish. I've seen it around and even been to its home ( which was lovely even if I didn't say a word the whole time I was there) but for some reason recently I just really want to test the waters there. I don't want to take away from my commitment to french, I just want to have a little fun on the side. No timelines, but something I could keep up for as long as I'm enjoying it.

So here's the question. Is it too early to open up my relationship with french? We are still fairly early into it and the last thing I want is to ruin that. Is there a good way I can start to dabble a little with Japanese but keep it fun and light right now? Something useful I could do to get a head start into our fling without investing much energy?

languagelearning,Looking for some advice,"Hello! I have been studying French for the last 6months at Alliance Française once a week for 3 hours, and I believe I have a very good progress. (Also as per my teacher’s assessment). But at this pace it would take a long time for me just to finish all A1/A2 units. 

My question is: what should I do if I am targeting to take B1/B2 DELF exam on May 2022? Taking fast track courses at AF is not possible for me as I have a day time job. And private courses comes with a hefty price tags too. 

I was thinking of skipping some units and just study them by myself. Do you think it’s really necessary to take all the units before taking any DELF exam? At the country where I am, only AF offers DELF exams twice every year (May and November).

From reading some posts and inspirations here on reddit, it could be doable and I know it would take a lot of effort from my side. But still looking for some recommendations / suggestions. Thanks!",1625107558,alter_ego_00000,4

languagelearning,Advice/resources for an aspiring polyglot?,"Hi r/languagelearning! I've been lurking here for a little bit, but I wanted to get some advice on my current plan for becoming conversational in 5 languages before I graduate high school:

* **English**, my first language (fluent ✅)
* **Russian**, my second language
   * Currently keeping a daily diary in Russian and listening to some Russian podcasts/poetry on Spotify
   * Reading *Chelkash* by Maxim Gorky
   * I can understand/read much more than I can write/speak
* **Spanish**, my third language
   * Finished AP Spanish a year ago, studied it for 5 years in school
   * Reading a copy of Orwell's *1984* in Spanish, setting the NYT to Spanish mode when I read the news
* **Farsi**, my fourth language
   * My grandfather speaks it, but I currently don't know much beyond the basics
   * Creating a table of common phrases to study
   * Learning basic present vs. past tense for phrases like ""I want"" / ""I wanted""
* **French**, my fifth language
   * Creating a table of basic phrases to study
   * Reading French poetry side-by-side with the English translation, then listening to readings in French
   * Many of the word roots are very similar to ones I know, so I feel like I can usually get the gist of written French passages

languagelearning,Language Maintenance Capacity Strategy (for people that want to learn some deeply and some casually)?,"Hello, so I used to think I just sucked at languages? My parents are both multilingual due to their environment (both in childhood and adulthood)—especially my mom. She consistently speaks four languages/dialects due to work and gets to have extended conversations all day with native speakers and over a wide range of topics. It just gets to be part of her life. I’d place her at a B2/C1 for these and then an A2/B1 for a fifth language she used to study in school and use as a kid. She also played with two other languages but lost them. (Traveling with her is great lol.) 

I had started to believe that maybe I just didn’t get my parents’ language learning genes and almost gave up on years of language learning hours. I’m realizing now, though, (as I’m picking my languages back up) that I just needed to keep going and change up my strategy. Also, I’m realizing that I did also mess myself up by learning some similar languages concurrently for a bit. 

Then I found this subreddit (a couple days ago) and got really hopeful seeing all these people learning multiple languages and started dreaming about what I could do if I could just learn a couple more (over a lifetime, if I am lucky). 

What I’ve gathered from your comments so far (regarding my question): (1) Sometimes, language learning strategy isn’t obvious except maybe in hindsight. (2) You need to maintain your language skills, duh! (3) Maintaining multiple languages can take a lot of time, but maintaining a C1/C2/N language takes significantly less time/effort (but more upfront time/effort). (4) Getting back a language skill you’ve “lost” isn’t so hard with a bit of time (just inefficient to have to do too often). (5) Learning similar languages simultaneously is inadvisable until you get one to a high enough level due to potential confusion.

… which brings me to my question:

Is this an ok plan? —&gt; Brush up language skills for 3 previously-studied languages and bump them up to B2/C1 (while keeping a 4th native language). Maintain them forever. Have a revolving door for a fifth language slot for temporary use of a diverse group of languages (before travel or for temporary fun). Study/use only ONE of these revolving door languages at a time.

Do you think B2 is enough for this?  Would that revolving door make a mess of those main 4 languages (and all that hard work)? Would all the revolving door languages smush together? Anything else to watch out for?

languagelearning,Had my first real conversation with a stranger,"I know how dumb this sounds but hear me out.

Before this I had only spoken French to other people in zoom class or in online language exchange, and it was pretty frivolous stuff.

 I'll admit, I've only been learning French for a few months and had mostly stuck to texts/messanger to ask about apartments, but this landlady who absolutely didn't speak english *insisted* I call about renting.

I would have to ask questions about the apartment, discuss the lease and sell myself as a tennet *in French*. I had to actually communicate certain points and I was kind of terrified ngl. I couldn't just deflect questions I didn't know. I had to express myself in a language I barely spoke and understand key information about where I might be living for the next 9 months.

 My first sentence was complete gibberish. I was nervous as heck. But I took a breath, pushed through, and we started actually communicating.

I know how weird this sounds, but because of the pandemic I literally haven't had a chance to practice actually conversing with someone in real time, let alone a complete stranger. (This is also my first time apartment hunting which definitely didn't help my nerves)

I was terrified of sounding stupid, but I'm so glad I decided to get over myself and just call. She was super nice, and even started talking slower so I could follow along.

Yes, I did sound stupid, I messed up words and misconjurgated more then a few verbs. But I also introduced myself well enough to get offered the apartment.

Conversations can be really intimidating, but I guess I'm just saying go for it. It's super easy to overthink it, but the best thing to do is just jump right in. Idk happy language learning guys.",1625034687,Sup3rPotatoNinja,9

I plan to do 6 month language immersion for each (if that’s possible?)

This is why I think language immersion would be the best for me. I’ve never even heard of it until recently, does anyone have any tips for me? Should I achieve a certain level of language comprehension before beginning? About how much money should I save before beginning an abroad program? Can student loans be applied towards this? What are some good, legit language immersion programs? How do they work? 

Just some extra details:

I would like to start with a language immersion program in France, and I’m comfortable with going over to temporarily live in Europe since my brother lives in Germany, so I’ll have family relatively close by (he is trilingual, so I can still “immerse” as he is fluent in French). I’m only adding this detail, because it makes going off to a whole new country/continent seem a bit more practical lol. Also, I’m an international studies major so I’m dying to experience more of the world and live abroad (I’ve lived in my small American town my WHOLE life) - especially while I’m young and in my 20s.

languagelearning,Critique my Russian Routine,"
Hello all, I have been studying Russian for about 8 months. My goal is really to communicate with Russian friends and family I spend time with. I can read Russian but it's not my main interest. Here are the resources that I use the most.

1. \[2000 Russian Words in Context\]([https://www.audible.com/pd/2000-Russian-Words-Russian-Edition-Audiobook/B00HZ0F3HS](https://www.audible.com/pd/2000-Russian-Words-Russian-Edition-Audiobook/B00HZ0F3HS)).  This is useful for me because I can play it for hours while I work. Sentences are in Russian then English, it reinforces vocabulary and I do think it has been useful. They are a bit robot-like but I think it is helpful.
2. \[Easy Russian Youtube Channel\]([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxvt-g7JsPNnEn8tUtZZBBg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxvt-g7JsPNnEn8tUtZZBBg)) I think this has been helpful for understanding Russian \*as it is actually spoken\*. I pay for the transcripts and go over phrases which are new to me, try to look at the grammar. Trying to figure out how tiny phrases like также, чем-либо, какие-то work in a sentence and change the meaning feels useful. When translated word for word these phrases are hard to understand for me so seeing them used in conversation feels like finding the missing piece. 
3. \[Russian Podcast/Youtube Channel with Max\]([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCklUqFEcJqFnWKEBozw5p4g](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCklUqFEcJqFnWKEBozw5p4g)) This is probably the most comprehensible Russian podcast and Youtube channel I have found, though sometimes the length of the podcasts make it easy for me to tune out because I feel like I get the ""gist"" of it.
4. Quizlet- I do a lot of vocabulary and I think this might be my strength, but I might start to use flash cards with full sentences instead of just one word at a time. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here are my specific struggles-

\*the more flexible word order. I know Russian does have some fixed word order but since it is more flexible than English I have a hard time following the direction of action. In conversations with speakers this happens VERY often that I think I know what they are talking about because I recognize most of the vocabulary but the final message of the conversation is totally lost on me. I can somewhat recognize cases but I do feel like it is not intuitive to me yet so maybe this is part of it

\*I have just recently found a great conversation partner who is really patient in Russian, and any ideas on how to best use that time would be appreciated. Sometimes we do random questions back and forth on basic topics/icebreakers but any other ideas would be cool.

\*Here is one big struggle- the family I spend the most time with, I am not comfortable yet really trying to talk because the corrections are so specific, it really takes the wind out of my sails. The one who corrects my grammar the most (which I definitely appreciate) used to teach Russian in Kazakhstan so I think she is teaching for students who are really above my level. I don't think I am going to 100% nail cases any time soon, I really just want to be understood and participate in conversation a bit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions on what to concentrate on, resources you could recommend ideas for activities to make interaction a little easier, would be really appreciated. Obviously the key here is quantity of listening, more content, more movies et cetera, but I do think I have a solid basis for at least getting across ideas and am having trouble taking the plunge in conversation. I have learned a couple of languages in my free time (french and spanish) to pretty good levels, but Russian is definitely so much slower, and I don't think the grammar is something I can just ""pick up"" like I did with the other two. I have put a lot of time into studying Russian and I really want to put it into use!",1624999254,missjo7972,2

I would love to be able to read real time French subtitles of the dinner table conversation, or perhaps review a transcript of the conversation afterwards.

languagelearning,What is the value in learning languages where most speakers can speak English? (For EN Speaker),"I constantly keep flirting with the idea of learning German because its strongly related to my heritage and I love genealogy and the idea of connecting with ones roots. But for one reason or another I keep encountering mental barriers when it comes to giving the language an honest try.

For those who know me, I am all for helping learn and teach very obscure minority languages and would normally be the first person to recommend learning whatever language you like: so long as you like it. Usefulness shouldn't matter! But when it comes to German I feel like the language is in no way in danger or under obligation to be learned because of some minority pride or something. The language is one of the biggest of Europe and it would do just fine even if I didn't learn it.

But if I did learn it, it also feels like it wouldn't be particularly ***useful*** because I don't really have any intention of going to any German speaking countries, and if I did I am sure almost everyone I could encounter would speak relatively OK English. I mean sure if I lived there I would want to learn German just to fit in, but especially for Germans on the internet it seems like there is no place or requirement to learn or use any German to engage in their content.

So to re-cap German lives in this very strange space where its big enough that you wouldn't learn it to try to preserve it or revitalize it, but its also relatively useless for English speakers because there seems to be very little people or contents you are gated from as most Germans online can speak OK English. And trying to speak broken German at them will probably just get responses in English.

I think German is probably not the only language in this position, you could probably come up with similar concerns for most major Germanic languages when you speak English. At least learning Russian or Chinese you can reasonably assume a lot of people and content are being unlocked for you that you didn't have access to before, or learning a smaller language like Faroese or Catalan can promote some kind of minority pride or sense of community. 

What is the value in learning a language like German in this case?",1624985663,Xefjord,32

I'm moving to the states soon and I want to start learning Spanish. I've just started learning some basic sentences and I'm noticing a lot of parallels with french. I'm worried that because they are so similar I'll get words mixed up or I'll start accidentally imposing Spanish pronunciation into my french or vice versa. 

I'm quite happy with how my french accent is at, but I'm worried if I dive deep into spanish it could potentially effect it.

Anyone have any experience or advice on the matter? 

Thanks!",1624946816,koopajean,5

languagelearning,Thoughts on “Streaks”,"Hey all! I’ve noticed lots of language learning apps and methods use streaks as a motivator (ie don’t miss a day or the streak is broken). I initially thought this was a good way to keep learners on track, but now, I notice that I will only study to keep the streak, not because I necessarily *want* to, and therefore am not really learning as much. Does using a streak for motivation work for you? If not, what do you do? Ignore it completely, or set your own schedule (presumably with days off).",1624939256,Tired_Pixie,16

And when I try it feels like this big ball of thorns and I’m trying to do all these things and I can do them, but only kinda.  My knowledge is so fractured. I’m thinking about giving up.  I don’t want to because I love it. I’m B2 in Italian and that gave me so much pleasure.

languagelearning,Spanish or Arabic for a college student ?,"I’m an incoming college student and am deciding between taking Spanish and Arabic to fulfill my language requirement. I’m very much stuck and so would appreciate any help!

A little background:

I’ve taken Latin all four years in high school. I’ve done well, but I don’t feel super confident in my skills. Especially given the fact that I’ve spent the last year on zoom — I feel like I’ve forgotten a lot. So I don’t think I’ll be able to easily slide into Spanish. 

The language I would really love to learn is Hebrew, as I visit Israel often and have lots of family there. But unfortunately that’s not offered at my school. That’s why I’m thinking about Arabic — I see it as maybe the next best thing?

On the other hand, I live in the States, and so Spanish would be very useful. 

Also — languages have never come easily to me. So the difficulty of the language is a factor. 

Thank you so much for your input! I really appreciate it.",1624931071,LatinIdioms,10
languagelearning,Immersion Identity Crisis,"Do you ever feel like you are trying to be someone else? Or ever just questioned your identity when speaking a foreign language?

I've been learning Chinese for a long time now, somewhere between HSK 5 and 6 rn (C1/2). My new roommate happens to be Chinese and for the last few months we've been actively conversing in Mandarin for most daily things. It was a bit bumpy in the first month but now we've got the hang of each others' way of speaking. I was always insecure about my identity, but I feel that this has just push it over the edge, like I am trying to be someone else.

To give you some context, as someone who's lived in multiple countries, I've never really felt a strong sense of identity anywhere. Bumping from one international school to another, I didn't have a solid group of friends, grew up an introvert consuming Anime and in the last few years, moved to generally East Asian TV shows. I started off learning Japanese as a hobby, but soon switched to Chinese because it was easier. Now it feels like I started it as a way of escapism, maybe because I never really built a linguistic identity?

Apologies for this rather sentimental post, but these thoughts have been troubling me and dissuading me from learning for a while now. When you've been learning a language for a long time, how do you deal with it becoming a part of your identity?",1624926708,throwawayforgb2023,28

I've found some music to listen too that helps some (once I get the translation memorized). Anyone here who is a native speaker or someone who has learned the language themselves have any tips?

languagelearning,An Appreciation Post for Babbel,"Hi everyone! I just wanted to make a post about a specific language learning resource that I've actually found very helpful; that resource is Babbel.

When I first started learning Swedish, I used a lot of apps like Duolingo and Memrise that didn't honestly help me very much. These might work for some people, I'm not trying to hate on them, but for me they weren't the best. Probably the only language learning app that I actually really enjoyed, however, was Babbel. After discovering it, I used it to get myself to a level in Swedish where I could start searching for comprehensible input and learning that way.

Babbel is honestly great because it combines vocabulary with grammar, teaching you both at the same time. It's much less gamified than other apps, but I think that's honestly a good thing. It's like a digital textbook almost, but with an automated flashcard review system and native speaker audio. I had the most success with it when I took notes on each lesson and also made sure to do my reviews each day.

Babbel will NOT get you fluent, but after trying out dozens of different apps I can confidently say that there is  no such thing as a language learning app that will make you fluent. You have to actually use the language for that, and it takes time. What Babbel does is help you to learn key vocab terms while also learning grammar rules for the language, it can help you get to the point where you can actually begin using the language and learning through immersion.

One thing I also really appreciate about Babbel is that they have a student discount, you can get three months for only $14.99. This was helpful to me as a university student and was one of the reasons I tried out Babbel to begin with, so definitely look into that if you're a student and considering Babbel.

Here are some cons I've found:

\-The native speakers tend to speak fairly slowly. This is helpful for figuring out pronunciation but can make your listening comprehension be worse than your reading, writing, and speaking. This can be solved by listening to native content on your own.

\-There aren't many chances to write in the language, other than writing a word or phrase to fill in a blank. I know apps like Busuu allow you to submit texts in your TL to have corrected by native speakers, a feature like this would make Babbel even better.

\-You have to be consistent. Babbel worked great for me but I did it every day and took notes on the lessons. If you aren't a very motivated learner, Babbel might be difficult for you as it isn't really gamified or anything. You have to actually be willing to study for it to work, I've found.

Anyway, I just felt like making this post after signing up for a subscription to Babbel's French course today. I was initially trying to follow a Refold-based approach for French, but while that works fine for my Swedish I felt like it was very difficult to do as a complete beginner in a language. I think putting in some actual time studying can definitely get you through the beginner stages way quicker, so you can start actually enjoying the native content you watch. I signed up for Babbel since it worked so well for me with Swedish, and after starting to use it again I realized that it's a really underrated resource. I never see many people talk about it, so I wanted to make a post about it for those who haven't looked into it before.

I would specifically recommend it for beginners. Once you're at an upper beginner/intermediate level I think you'll be much better off if you just immerse in the language. I think that what Babbel does best is getting you through the beginner stages, the A1 and A2, in a comprehensive and timely manner so that you aren't floundering around forever in the starting stages.

Note: I'd just like to make a note that I'm not sponsored at all by Babbel, I'm not getting paid or getting a discount or anything to make this post, I just legitimately feel like it's a great resource that doesn't get talked about much. I think it can save both time and money compared to things like trying to just immerse straight away without having any prior knowledge in the language, or paying for expensive language classes.",1624923318,FrostyMammoth3469,8

languagelearning,Learning Chinese and becoming an Army Linguist.,"Some people in another thread seemed really interested in the story, so here ya go. 

It is a story spanning two years. Best of times, worst of times. I'll give a short rundown just so I'm not a tease, but I someday plan on telling the whole story somewhere.

I lived in Taiwan for two years. First year I was an English teacher and studied Mandarin at a language training center in the mornings. Nearly every national university in Taiwan has a mandarin training center for the local foreigners. It was great, but I wanted a more authentic experience(Taiwan is an extremely haunting, romantic place, imo, and I wanted to live it authentically immersed in the language and culture). So after the first year, I found a school that would not only give me a massive raise( $35usd/hr) but they paid me under the table so I avoided taxes. I did this all with saving a decent nest egg in mind. The next six months I moved to the deep south, a place called 內埔 to live and work on a pineapple farm. My Chinese got really good(that's its own story, honestly.)

After some risky financial decisions (a fancy way of saying betting on McGregor to ko Mayweather) I was in debt, nearly out of cash, and had developed a rather valuable linguistic skill in Mandarin.

 I saw that the Army had $30,000(yes you're reading that right) bonuses for those who could pass the DLAB; a test developed by the DOD to test an applicants verbal IQ and penchant for learning languages. The recruiters told me I would not pass it. I did. They sent my ass to Ft. Jackson. 

After basic training, they sent me to DLI--Defense Language Institute--in Monterey, CA; the worlds premier foreign language school. I tried telling someone, ""Hey, I actually already speak Mandarin. I don't need to go to school to learn it again."" All I was told was, ""It ain't the Mandarin we want you to know, trainee!"" In hindsight they were right. DLI trains you to ostensibly be a spy. So you need to know mountains of political and military language. And having learned a bulk of my Mandarin from pineapple farmers and cute Taiwanese college students, I may not have been much help in a skiff or in Washington. 

At DLI you're still in a military unit, but you're also in a ""schoolhouse"" with a chairperson. So you have military bosses and bosses at school. Keep in mind you are a student, but it is also your job, and what will eventually be at stake is the lives of soldiers, contractors, special operators, and who knows who else, so they take your success very, very seriously. You are assigned a language, and only in very rare circumstances can switch languages. At the time I was there, (2017-2019) the hottest languages were Korean, Mandarin, Russian, and Levantine Arabic(spoken in Syria and Iraq). Funny enough I got there and they assigned me Korean. I told my platoon sergeant that I already spoke Mandarin, and since it was a high priority language, they switched me with some poor schlub without even confronting him about it.  

At DLI, you are in class 7 hours a day. That's right: 7 hours a day of language learning. I am still of the belief that not even immersion can beat the language education at DLI. And trust me, I've done both. The style of learning depends upon what schoolhouse you end up in, but mine regardless it is going to be listening intensive because, like I said, your job one day will be listening and reading, mostly; unless you end up with the CIA, but I don't know anything about that...

A guy down the hall from me in the barracks ended up being the nations 6th ranked mountain runner, and we began training together after class and on weekends. My fitness levels went through the roof, scored perfect on the Physical Fitness Test, and since I had a background in Mandarin, had a 4.0 GPA with little effort. Meanwhile half of my classmates are failing. The failure rates for CAT IV languages hovers around 50%.  

So far, I would venture to guess that this story sounds great, right? Adventure, success, some level of intrigue, and world class linguistics?! And yes, that all may be true, but with such a high level of success comes a target on one's back. I am an outspoken and brash bastard. Mixed with success, this leads to as much hate as it does love. There was a time where brash bastards were what the Army wanted, but not nowadays, my friends. 

From here, the story is filled with sex, backstabbing, immersion trips to Taiwan, Nazis(yes, I promise this is true and I have proof,) Jordan Peterson, a schizophrenic Mexican pretending to be Jewish, and my political allegiances coming into question by the commanding officer of Delta Company. 

Like I said, this is nothing in comparison to the real, in depth story, but this is the brief beginning of DLI, and my time as an Army linguist.",1624905857,TrennyDelts,102

Now, assuming that in all cases you want to reach and keep fluency:

* How do you handle learning a new language, and at the same prevent unlearning the previous ones? 
* In terms of frequency how often do you listen, read, etc. to maintain said fluency in each?

I know three languages. Bengali, English, and Hindi. I live in Sydney and can fluently mimic a British and an American accent. I am studying Finance and I intend to develop a career in consulting or investment. 

English- Native 

Bengali- Mother Tongue

Hindi- I can speak and listen but can't write or read.

I watch a lot of foreign films and learning French might open a door to so many good books and movies. Also, going to France on vacation sounds to be an amazing prospect. Also, it's probably a bit easier than Mandarin and more in vogue in Canada, which I might visit soon. 
2. Why Mandarin- With so many Mandarin speakers here in Australia, it might be easy to practice. Moreover, Mandarin probably has a lot of uses in the careers I am opting for. I am not sure about the cultural thing with Mandarin.

languagelearning,Learning a language and being LGBT,"First off, I'm not straight, and that is a major component of this topic. Language is obviously one part of the larger picture regarding people's culture, and it's a tool by which we can communicate with people from widely different cultures. 

With those things being said, have you ever been put off from learning a language because of the general cultural attitudes of some of its speakers? I have been interested in learning a few different languages, at least in the form of a few phrases, just to be able to communicate with people and learn. To me, it's an amazing thing to learn just the smallest thing about another language and culture. 

It hurts though when you put yourself into a situation where you're called homophobic slurs in another language. Even if you don't know exactly everything, you can pick up on slurs and generalities. It's even worse if you can tell someone is completely uninterested in speaking with you, or worse, is actively hostile towards you because of your sexuality. I'm not super flamboyant, or decked out in rainbow gear, but I am noticeably not heterosexual. 

Things like this have made me not want to learn certain languages, or interact with people from those communities. I grew up in a rural area filled with religious conservatives who spoke English. Why would I want to switch that out for essentially the same thing, but a different language/cultural group? Maybe I'm just jaded?

languagelearning,"I'm mulling over what my language project should be, based on how the sort of experiences they will open up to me and the quality of life of the regions in which they are spoken. Which of these would you choose?","So, over the last few years I've been casually learning several major European languages. I speak fairly good French and Portuguese, decent but rusty Spanish, and beginner conversational level of German and Italian. I'll spend the next year knuckling down and immersing myself in environments where I can perfect these languages (workaway, farmstays, immersion courses, working at a ski resort in Austria, etc), so I'm fairly confident that by this time next year I'll be at B2 level in about 5 different languages. They are all European, most are quite widely spoken, and all are relatively easy for a native English speaker. I feel like they were amongst the best languages I could have picked, as there is a very high ""return on investment"" for them all - for just a couple of months of learning Spanish, for example you open up a large body of TV, films, music, tourist destinations, job opportunities etc. 

I feel like I have sort of exhausted the easy-but-useful languages. The only other languages I'm aware of which have the same cultural reach are Arabic, Russian and maybe Mandarin. These are all problematic to me, mostly because I don't wish to live in an authoritarian country or one with harsh religious laws, which significantly limits my options in these regions. They are also notoriously difficult languages, with some online sources suggesting that to learn Mandarin would take as much time to learn as the 5 languages I'm learning put together. I'm sure Taiwan and Singapore are amazing places, but 2 or 3 years is a long time to spend in such small countries.

Another option is to learn a regional ""trade language"", something like Swahili or Indonesian. My understanding is that these are widely spoken across their regions and relatively easy, but that they are mostly spoken as a second language, so it would be a bit like learning English to move to Sweden or Russian to move to Latvia I guess, and also because these regions are economically weak, I assume there are fewer job opportunities, less high-quality media (TV, films etc).

The third option I'm considering is Japanese. It is also famously difficult, but the country is famously beautiful, stable, prosperous, has varied topography, and a very rich media. In short, it's a place where I think I would enjoy a higher quality of life, but I worry that I would get bored of living there for an extended period, given the cultural homogeneity in comparison with Western Europe.

Lastly, I'm thinking of Hindi. It has lots of speakers, and India seems like a place with extraordinarily varied culture and topography, but there is a lot of information I don't know - for instance, I know India will not be as socially liberal as California or Sweden, but is casual dating acceptable in bigger cities? Does the government ever ban social media to silence criticism? And I've also heard that Hindi is not spoken by most Indians.

I’ve posted on here multiple times I think, whining about not knowing which language to focus on etc.

I promised myself there would be no new language projects before I reach conversational fluency in Portuguese and maybe even Spanish(hard to say, maybe A2-ish).

However, I’ve went through my old notes ONCE in the past month or so, zero proper study sessions.

I got the inspiration to learn French after falling in love with France’s song in this this year’s Eurovision. However it makes no sense to go from one Romance language to the next(Spanish-Portuguese-French). I’d just end up mixing them all probably.

Sooooo.....now I want to learn Dutch. It’s been on my list for a while but I’ve gotten pretty into the work of a Dutch singer and actress Willemijn Verkaik, who played the lead in one of my favorite musicals in three languages, two of which I can speak.

I can speak German. The level is hard to say again, but I did get a “good” grade in a national teat this year. Not 100% fluent but still pretty good. I may even get into university to study German. For  that reason me studying Dutch might not be the best idea....

languagelearning,I spoke Korean with native speakers and it felt great!,"Have to celebrate! I went to get my nails done and realized the women there were speaking Korean. When my nail tech asked me (in English) if I liked the color, I swallowed my nervousness and replied ""yes, it's very pretty"" in Korean. She looked so shocked and complimented my accent. We then had a lovely conversation about how long I've been learning and which dramas are best for listening practice (according to her, not Crash Landing on You). Some of the other nail techs joined too and it was just such a happy little moment for me.

My Korean is FAR from perfect and it was a very simple conversation. There were a few times they had to switch briefly back to English when I didn't understand a question. But I still felt so accomplished for taking the plunge and just trying. Not to mention it felt really cool saying ""bye"" and ""thank you"" to each other in Korean on my way out the door!

languagelearning,Finding assimil difficult,"I've been learning French for a few months now, and started using assimil about 2/3 months ago. I'm using the French with ease, but the newer 2020 version. The first 30 or so lessons were good and fairly smooth sailing, I was learning a lot each lesson and could remember most of what I learnt. I'm now on lesson 54 and it is getting a lot more difficult. The productive phase is easy enough, but it's the first phase which I'm now struggling with. The lessons are long (20 or so lines), and I rarely understand the lessons in the first hearing. Even in the revision dialogues I don't seem the understand the listening on the first recording, but need to listen whilst reading the French to be able to somewhat follow. As a test, I tried to listen to two past lessons, 40 and 42. 40 was ok and got the gists and was able to understand most of it (though some lines were difficult). 42 was very difficult and barely understood, except for the main plot - however it's difficult to know if I'm understanding because I understand the French, or if I just remember the lesson. Whilst reading the French text and listing I am a lot more comfortable and can follow.

My general process has been:
1) listen first without reading
2) listen whilst reading English diagolue
3) listen whilst reading french dialogue
4) go through line by line whilst repeating and looking at translation
5)listen again reading french
6) listen again without looking
7) read grammar notes and do exercises. The listening translate exercises I almost never get first time, the written ones are a bit better but still need to lookup things.

Not sure what to do now, I don't want to give up on the series. I am thinking to take a break and go through the past ten lessons or so all again to rejig my memory, or to continue at a slower pace whilst also reviewing. I'm half tempted to try the assimil french with ease older version as I read the 2020 one is harder. Comparing the two books the pre 2020 one was a lot simpler in terms of length (but had more lessons) which would suit me more.

I wanna show you how I feel

A flare ignites my hopeless doom
It cheers me up in the presence of you
I wanna show you how I feel

I’m so in love
And that’s just how I feel.

What I mean on the first phrase is that the more in love I am, the weaker I get. You can’t control your feelings, so your heartbeat just keeps on racing up killing you slowly as you fall deeply in love.

On the second phrase, what I’m trying to say is that I know my fatal destiny. I know this person won’t like me back and probably doesnt even care about my existence.

I used to be fluent in French, my mother and I would regularly have conversations together. I was pretty young at the time, and French language was taught all through my schooling.

languagelearning,Mid-Year Progress Update,"I started this year wanting to focus mainly on French, Dutch, and Icelandic, and casually do some Spanish and Italian. I evaluated my skill levels at the end of January, and now (end of June):

French in January: listening B1+, reading C1+, speaking B1+, writing B2

French in June: listening C1+, reading C2, speaking B2+, writing B2+

My biggest surprise here was how much progress I've made in listening, which is always a weak point for me due to some general auditory processing difficulties. I've logged over 200 hours of French listening (a mix of audiobooks, movies and films--mostly with French subtitles active as well--and Youtube) since the beginning of this year. In writing, I've realised that while I can express myself pretty well (judging by feedback), I make a ton of really stupid mistakes due to lack of focus, stuff like wrong verb forms or adjective forms even though I know better. To a degree, those stupid little mistakes have always been a problem of mine in all kinds of tests and exams, but they've become more frequent and I'm afraid that might cost me the writing score of any future language exams so it's definitely something I need to work on to try to reduce them again.

Dutch in January: listening weak B1, reading weak B2, speaking A2+, writing B1+

Dutch in June: listening B1+, reading B2+, speaking B1+, writing B1+

As you can see, there's less progress than in French, and no progress at all in my writing skill (which I haven't practised much, to be fair). I've noticed a significant improvement in reading comprehension and speed, though, and my listening comprehension is slowly getting better as well (both of which pull my speaking skill up too). My listening practice has been split between Youtube (programmes for natives where I still struggle with comprehension a lot of the time, partly due to the conditions and partly because of the speech itself) and a Belgian TV crime series, which I'm watching on DVD with Dutch subtitles. For some reason, this Flemish show is quite a bit easier to understand than the other Dutch speakers on Youtube, but I'm aware that it's facilitated by subtitles so the actual comprehension difference might be less significant overall.

Icelandic in January: neither skill was at A1 yet

Icelandic in June: listening A1, reading A2, speaking weak A1, writing A1

The reading progress really surprised me and I didn't realise I had reached A2 until I started with Olly Richard's graded reader and was able to read the first story without too much struggle (the reader level is given as A2-B1). For me, the early stages of a new language feel pretty much like ""I feel like an idiot and know nothing"" even when I'm progressing so this was a nice realisation. I still have two and a half more courses on Icelandic Online plus most of the graded reader before I will move on to Harry Potter 1 (which seemed like the easiest choice after the graded reader since there's a significant lack of graded reading material for Icelandic, and I know that book well). I also have the audiobook of the graded reader, so that will be my first listening-only experience.

Both Spanish and Italian haven't really progressed since I haven't put much work into either language (watching a few movies, mostly, and some grammar revision for Spanish), so they're both still sitting at an intermediate passive/beginner (because rusty as hell) active level for now. I'll slowly put more focus on Spanish moving forward but Italian will likely stay in this semi-dormant casual state till next year.

I have also recently started Japanese because my partner wants to learn it and I'd love to learn a language together with him, but I've not gotten far yet. I know the kana more or less, and a few basic phrases, but that's it so far. This one will progress slowly for now as my focus will stay on the first three languages mentioned (French, Dutch, Icelandic).

What comes next?

Since I've made a lot more progress in French than I expected, I'm tentatively aiming for DALF C2 in November (if I can get my active skills up to that level by October; if not, I'll plan for May 2022).

For Dutch, the CNaVT C1 is my official end goal (highest official language exam for Dutch). I just looked it up and found out that the testing center in my city only has this exam in May each year (so only once a year, not twice like most other exams) so now I'm wondering whether May 2022 may be doable. If not, then it has to wait till May 2023 although I would have liked to take it towards the end of 2022--not an option, unfortunately XD

I'll continue using (and thus over time improving) both languages even beyond the exams but will then pivot focus to other languages (next ones to focus on for exam prep will be Icelandic--up to B2--and Spanish to C2).",1624748959,Miro_the_Dragon,14

To be 100% frank, I would like to put in minimal effort and end up with a minimal amount of language ability. I know a few people (including myself) who went through the whole Duolingo tree and ended up with enough language ability to understand maybe 70%-80% of a newspaper or book, but zero ability to actually speak to another person or hold a conversation -- that's what I'm hoping for here. 

I've heard some stories about people going through the whole Duolingo tree for Asian languages and ending up with language that's not just mediocre but completely nonsensical. That's the only thing I'm worried about, basically.

Hi 🙋‍♂️, I’m an Arabic tutor.
I’ve been working as a tutor for almost 3 years, it’s my passion and I’d love to share this knowledge that I got as a gift by birth. I was lucky enough to learn other languages such as English, Turkish and Russian. I came up to a conclusion that learning new languages is quite easy and fun if you have the right tutor. 
I’m willing to help you learn the following: 
-classical Arabic( fusha)
-MSA (Modern spoken Arabic)
- A variety of accents such as 
Egyptian 
Levantine 
Khlaiji( gulf countries accents) 
- Develop your ability to communicate and feel comfortable with speaking Arabic. 
It doesn’t matter if you are an absolute beginner, an intermediate or just want to be perfect in Arabic.

languagelearning,I will attempt to learn Spanish from immersion without looking anything up,"### What I'll be doing precisely

I will attempt to learn Spanish by consuming Spanish media that's not intended for language learners, and by talking to native speakers in the final stages. I will not look up any words, grammar structures, or look at anything that's made with the intent of teaching you Spanish. (The only exception being, that I will look up the titles of things that I want to watch by going on the Wikipedia page and switching the language to Spanish)

I'll document the process by:

* counting the hours I spend with Spanish organized into categories such as Audio-only,
* rating content on how comprehensible I find them on a scale I devised, at least one at the end of each week,
* I will occasionally make journal entries, when I feel like it and when something interesting happens,
* and although I've decided against keeping track of exactly what I watch, I will give a rough description every week.

Based on the FSI's data it takes them around 1000 hours to get to a 3 on the IRL scale, which is either a B2 or a C1 depending on which source you look at. So I will set 1000 hours as the goal of the experiment. I can probably get that done sometime during next spring.

###My background

This will be my second attempt at this experiment (Back then I only aimed for a 100 hours). During my first attempt I have watched 30.5 hours of TV shows in Spanish, between the 11th and the 15th of February 2021. Daily logs were taken. Before that I knew absolutely no Spanish.

When counting my hours I will not count this for convenience, but I will add them at the end so that they will count towards the 1000 hours.

Non Spanish related background:

* Native language: Hungarian
* Second Languages: English, Japanese, (In addition I had German classes for 4 years, but I have gained practically zero competence, although I remember a bit about the grammar and a handful of words)
* Age at the start of the second attempt:21
* Location during both attempts: Hungary

I will start the attempt next Monday(2021-06-28)

### Why the post?

I plan on posting weekly updates containing that week's time data, comprehension ratings and journal entries. Usually on Mondays on the week after, or on Sundays if I happen to finish early.

* To my knowledge there is precisely one documented case of someone doing something similar. He abstained from reading altogether, but it still worked to some extent. I hope that seeing these posts might inspire others to try and attempt a similar experiment themselves. Reproducibility is necessary in science.
* I hope that it will help popularize the result, whatever it may end up being.
* If I post my journal all at once, no one will care enough to read it all. This way there is a chance maybe?
* I plan on setting my next week's goal in the thread, so that I'm somewhat accountable for actually reaching them. And with that being said,

My goal for next week (week 1): 55 hours

So my question is, would people and the mods be okay with me posting weekly? I remember someone posting weekly updates and he was doing something much less unusual, so I think it's okay, maybe?

languagelearning,Why are immersion / TPRS type language learning classes so rare?,"When I was training as an English teacher I was taught immersion techniques for language learning and as part of the course I had a class in a language I didn’t know and the class was completely in the foreign language.

Online I have found information about immersion techniques and TPRS but finding language teachers that actually use these methods is hard to find.

When I was looking for a Spanish teacher, I had to try about five teachers before I found one that actually spoke in Spanish for the whole class.

More recently, I was unable to find any TPRS teacher for German but I have eventually found some good German classes that I really enjoy the classes from and speak in German in the class.

Now I’ve started learning Greek more recently and again and I can’t find a TPRS teacher. There are some Greek TPRS videos on YouTube but sadly the teacher no longer teaches.

My Greek teacher is good and friendly but sometimes there is a lot of English in the class, it does seem to be improving a bit though and we’ve had a bit more Greek the last few weeks.

Why are TPRS/immersion techniques so rare?

Is TPRS just an unpopular method?

Does anybody use a realtime automatic speech-to-text to catch what a teacher says? I tried it in my previous lesson. Fortunately the transcription worked well. I looked up an unknown word in a transcription in a mouse over (popup) dictionary. I can add them to my vocabulary list. However, the teacher spoke too fast and live transcription delayed a couple of seconds. I felt it very long.

I’ve found myself, again, living in a new place where I don’t speak the language. This time it’s a language I wasn’t necessarily excited about, French, but still love languages so have spent the last 3 months pretending to learn (big Pimsleur fan, but I’m not consistent enough). 

I reeeeeaally needed a haircut, so I called to make a reservation (I’ve lost almost all shame at sucking in a new language) and strangely succeed (not many options when you call a hairdresser). 

Although I did have to call back the next day to confirm, turns out twelve and two in French sound similar and I was doubting haha. 

So that’s it. That’s the story. No matter how many times you start a language, there is always that feeling of hesitancy and dare I say shame, to try and communicate. After doing it more times than I should have, I’m feeling comfortable with sounding and looking like an idiot because I know it gets me closer to actually being able to communicate! 

Stick with it, everyday it gets better and while you’ll always feel a bit of doubt, one day you’ll realize you’re speaking your target language like a pro.

languagelearning,Just want to share my story about the language opportunities I have at my new job.,"Hey, y'all. I used to post in here nonstop on another account when I was new to my language obsession. Haven't been here in a while.

ANYWAYS, small backstory: One of the languages I've studied is Russian. I'm a fluent speaker of Spanish and French, and Russian was the first language I delved into that is significantly different from English. I went at it hard and made steady progress, but kept having to put it aside because of changes in other parts of my life. I got to a solid intermediate level and had a few italki sessions under my belt and was able to hold conversation but I had a small vocabulary and would need to ask people to repeat themselves or talk slowly, and I made grammar mistakes and such.

I very recently got hired at an eastern European market down the street from my place. The only workers there other than me are the owner, from Bosnia, and a lady from Ukraine. Today was my first day and I actually got to speak Russian in person with the Ukrainian! Before today, my only speaking experience was through Skype. 

A few years ago, I got a job in a taco place in which nobody spoke English, and it was a legit immersive environment. After a year of working there I managed to get very good at Spanish. And now I get to do that same thing again but with Russian!

I get to regularly hear Bosnian and Russian at my job. The Ukrainian woman hardly speaks English and it's very interesting to see her and our boss talk.

The Bosnian woman will start a conversation in English, the Ukrainian responds in Russian, and then the Bosnian responds to that in Bosnian, and then the Ukrainian and I will work together and chit-chat in Russian. It's just so cool to be around this all the time.

Perhaps I'm just very lucky and it's easier said than done, but I suggest to anyone and everyone to seek employment in a place where their TL is spoken, because it is a blast and perhaps the only way to immerse yourself in the language without traveling to another country.",1624693450,yeetmetothemoonzaddy,8
languagelearning,Should teachers give half marks if a student gets the spelling of a word half right or mostly right?,"Some students point out that some instructor of a French course would give half marks if the spellings are correct but the accent mark is wrong. They say the other teacher that gives a zero for the mistake is ""an idiot"" because everyone can still read it.

This is also the case in Chinese where some students can remember the radical of a character but misses a stroke somewhere. Some teachers would give 0.5 marks but students hate the teacher who say ""Wrong is wrong. Zero points!""",1624692671,yaboodooect,4
languagelearning,I finally finished a book!,"I studied Russian in uni as my major, and then moved to Russia right after. So you could say I’ve been learning it for seven years or so. My listening is great, but I’ve never really read a book in Russian start to finish, which is weird for me because I love devouring books in English. I guess I’m never really into the story. I also get frustrated that I can’t read as fast as I do in English. 


For the first time yesterday, I read the story (дама с собачкой) at a normal speed, and while there were words I didn’t know, I understood it, and actually finished it! And I actually enjoyed the story!!!! It only took me seven years.",1624692369,MossyTundra,31
languagelearning,Studying native language using target language - is there a point?,"I’m not sure when I first came across this suggestion, but I feel like I’ve heard more than one person recommend studying your native language using your target language once you reach a certain level of proficiency. 

I was thinking of trying it with Spanish on Duolingo once I wrap up the Spanish tree the regular way, but I wasn’t completely sure whether it was worth the effort. I could probably better use that time doing something like reading advanced books. 

Does anyone know of any benefits from using a target language to study a native language? 

I guess learning a second target language like French might have some benefits, but I’m not sure if there would be any point to learning English via Spanish.

languagelearning,PSA: Literal translations can be scary!,"Hi there. So, literal translations. They're terrible. Look, I know, the dictionary is telling you that *this word* in your native language translates exactly to *that word* in your target language. That's great, right? Well, sometimes. Other times, it will make you sound weird. Let me give you an example from a translation from English to Spanish.

The word ""scary"" in English is very common and versatile. It can be used for things that cause a physical fear reaction (a scary man) but also in a more abstract way (it's scary what people can do when they're desperate, it's scary how handsome I am).

This second, abstract, meaning in particular is difficult to translate directly into Spanish. I searched the word ""scary"" in a dictionary and these are the results, and in brackets my comments about why they don't work

* Escalofriante (this more like ""chilling"", as in the physical fear you feel when walking through the woods at night using your phone's lantern and suddenly you realize that your phone's battery is at 5% because you left the bluetooth on the whole day)
* Espeluznante (this is a dramatic word more suited for titles of Halloween-themed movies)
* Terrorífico (another dramatic word you'll be more likely to find in a novel)
* Tenebroso (has kind of a mysterious vibe, like something that is both scary and dark but interesting, like Billie Eilish's videos before she was blonde)
* Espantoso/horroroso (very negative words, as in scarily bad or scarily ugly, quite fit to describe someone that you are never, ever, ever getting back together with)
* Aterrador (""Terryfing"", so definitely scary but very strongly so)

So anyway how do you translate this abstract meaning of ""scary"" properly? You use the phrase ""dar miedo"". So: it's scary how handsome I am = A veces me veo en el espejo y me da miedo lo guapo que soy.

Now, how to avoid this? Well, I have two tips:

* Look up translations of whole phrases. I searched ""it's scary"" on this site called [ReversoContext](https://context.reverso.net/translation/english-spanish/it%27s+scary) and it instaly showed me many examples of ""dar miedo"". If you know of other sites like this, please share.
* When asking a native speaker for a word or expression in his language, don't ask for a single, contextless word (""How do you say 'scary' in Spanish?""). Rather, give context and ask them how *they* would say it (""Imagine you saw yourself in the mirror and you were literally afraid of your beautiful little face and also imagine you actually had good self esteem, how would you express that?"").",1624674135,greenraccoons,7
languagelearning,Suggestions for learning Mexican Spanish?,"I've heard that there are differences between Mexican Spanish and Spain Spanish. I have family and a boyfriend from Mexico and live in Texas, so learning Mexican Spanish makes more sense for me.

So questions:

1. Does the difference matter a lot? Will I be made fun or/not understood if I speak Spain Spanish to a Mexican Spanish speaker?

2. Any textbooks that you can recommend? I prefer this method to any digital learning options.

3. Any language learning videos you can recommend? When I was learning French for college I did wonderfully with a professor that only spoke French.

languagelearning,"Hello everyone, got any advice for a total beginner in Spanish?","I am a 16 year old native English speaker from the United States, and about a month ago I decided to learn Spanish. 

I have been taking 2 Pimsleur lessons per day, one it the morning and one around 2 hours before I go to sleep, and I add all the new words I learn to my AnkiApp.
 I also just started doing 2 or 3 language transfer lessons per day whenever I have blank space in the day.

languagelearning,I calculated out how long each Duolingo Course would take to Complete:,"Dear wonderful friends of r/languagelearning,

If you're anything like me, you often find yourself spending as much time fantasizing about knowing many languages, as you do actually learning one single language. Today, my fantasy brought upon the desire to perform some mathematics, and alas, we ended up here.

[Courses are English -\&gt; TL only, and are ordered by number of users.](https://preview.redd.it/2dghirfggg771.png?width=816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0835b0c3dd91d6dbf7367b9350520c5067b236a)

Courses are English -&gt; TL only, and are listed by number of users.

Behold, a Duolingo Course Calculator, to determine how long each course takes to complete entirely (all lessons, levels 1-5, and checkpoints included), working at varying paces. So, How does it work?

I timed myself doing various languages on Duolingo (Desktop Version) working at various paces, from as fast as possible, to as slow and thorough as possible. The time/pace of each category thus coincides with the average amount of time each lesson takes to complete. Let's go over the paces very quickly, shall we?:

* Very Fast: Not necessarily the recommended method of using Duo. While working this quickly, one fails to critically think on the material, and is often mistake-prone. An average lesson at this pace takes around 80 seconds (1m20s).
* Fast: Still working quickly through the lesson, but taking a little more time to think on the material. An average lesson at this pace takes around 100 seconds (1m40s).
* Medium: A nice balance of speed and thoroughness. I often find myself working between the fast and medium paces which I set. An average lesson at this pace takes around 150 seconds (2m30s).
* Thorough: Taking more time to read carefully through each prompt, speaking out loud. Through working at this pace, you are likely to really absorb everything there is to know. An average lesson at this pace takes around 200 seconds (3m20s).
* Very Thorough: Making sure not to make any mistakes, double checking spelling, and even researching grammar points and reviewing notes during lessons. This is the slowest pace, but blends in other methods of learning while also doing Duolingo. An average lesson at this pace takes around 240 seconds (4m0s).

An additional note or two on time:

* Firstly, the time varies much between languages. For languages more similar to English (such as Spanish, German, etc) it is much easier to complete lessons more quickly than languages with different writing systems, tonal languages, etc... (Chinese, Japanese, Russian). So please keep in mind, these category names are rough estimates and they vary by languages.
* This is the time of ACTIVE LEARNING ONLY. I've added in around a 10 seconds of time, for the time it takes between lessons (to load up and begin the next lesson). But the times you see on the table are the active learning times of reading each prompt and responding as effectively as possible.

So, what can we conclude from this?

* We can first conclude that Duolingo isn't going to get you fluent in a language. While about everyone in this sub already understands this, even with the longest courses (Spanish and French, which take over 40 hours of active learning to complete), you aren't going to even get 600 hours it takes to achieve general proficiency in these languages. In fact, completing every course would take around 600 hours of active learning, the amount of time generally needed to fully learn one FSI Category I language to proficiency.
* For languages such as Chinese (Mandarin) and Arabic, approximately 2200 hours are needed for general proficiency, and the Duolingo course only provides around 12 and hours of active learning (but likely much longer, as the Chinese and Arabic lessons often take longer).

HOWEVER:

* This doesn't mean that Duolingo is worthless. It is still in fact a wonderful way to begin learning vocabulary words and basic grammar concepts. A nice way to 'get your feet wet' before jumping into the vast world of language learning.
* From completing a Duolingo course, you can begin to use your language skills and apply them in simple everyday tasks, and begin to read books and consume media (although this is quite difficult).

I want to learn both. As far as German goes I like German bands, and have some favorite YouTubers that talk about German a lot because their channels are about the language and culture. Another thing with German though is that it's hard to find people to practice with whereas Spanish is very easy to find people to practice with.",1624617111,Opening-Ad5364,5

languagelearning,"Twitter account for immersion: a success story about language learning and building fluency as an introvert - featuring Omar Sy from ""Lupin""","Early last year, once the pandemic struck my country, I decided to create a Twitter account for French immersion. This is a common practice and a tip lots of people give out to those who can't travel or visit the countries in which their target language is spoken. But turns out it was so much better than I expected - I basically leveled up from A2 to a solid B2 in a few months thanks to it.  

To sum up my experience, I created a spare account and there I followed ONLY French-speaking people of all sorts - that means common users, celebrities, politicians etc. **I created a pretty diverse timeline**, which would help me read and listen to the language in all of its manifestations, both colloquial and formal. I learned SO MANY slangs and my speech and writing became a lot less ""textbookish"" and more natural thanks to that. So that's a piece of advice I give to those who also want to try their hand at an immersion account: follow all sorts of people!

Ever since then, **I log into that account at least once a day and check what people are talking about, what are the main topics of discussion in the French-speaking world right now, read some news, try to make sense of the memes etc.** I occasionally write some posts too and went viral once with one in which I was talking about how much I had liked ""Lupin"" (Netflix) as a language learner; its main actor, Omar Sy, saw what I had written and not only liked it but also retweeted it! That was amazing. [Here are some screenshots of that day.](https://i.imgur.com/939aVHC.png) I also got into a couple catfights due to people being rude for the most ridiculous reasons (it's the Internet, after all), and guess what? Even moments like these turned out to be wonderful ways to learn new vocabulary and polish my skills. 

I don't always interact, most of the times I just lurk, but it's already of great help. Having an immersion Twitter account allows me to get **the necessary amount of daily exposure without needing to be constantly chatting to someone (I'm a big introvert so having 1x1 conversation partners never worked out for me).** Besides that,  I also follow a lot of channels that I find interesting on YouTube, in all the languages I speak, so when I log into it I check what's new and watch a **few videos from my favorite YouTubers**, regardless of the language. In French, I specially like Charlie Danger and Squeezie. That's another simple and fun way to keep in touch with my studies.

So here's me saying: don't understimate what an immersion account can do for you, regardless of the social media website you prefer to use. Go and make your own!",1624609391,alienscully,23

Maybe it's good for people who don't want to be fluent, but just able to get by??? Like someone walking around with a dictionary, and a dictionary for grammar in their head and hoping it translates well. You'll never be fluent that way.

So, I want to kill the idea that textbooks can take you to fluency. It is a wheelchair. Good for emergencies, but it won't allow you to run. Depends on how ambitious you are I guess. Most people will settle for the wheelchair. It's ""good enough"". If you actually wanted fluency, you shouldn't be studying running techniques while on the wheelchair.

languagelearning,Finding the right reading and listening material is like finding the right size of weights to work out with.,"For the past year I've been working on improving my Japanese reading skills. I went with light novels because a lot of animes I liked don't have a second season and a lot of them don't have official translations so I have no choice but to bite the bullet and read them in Japanese. After all, it would be good reading practice right?

While it was good practice, it burned me out so much for the same reason playing games in Japanese sapped my enjoyment of the game. It was a choice between looking up every single unknown word or missing out on a lot of basic details because there were too many words I didn't know. Even if there were parts where I knew every single word and didn't have to look them up, there was still a lot of energy spent trying to decipher things especially if it's a really long sentence.

Recently I leveled down to manga simply because there were some mangas I wanted to read. At first it was a struggle but nowhere as much of a struggle as light novels because there's images this time and I didn't have to slog through tons of monologue I have to decipher before the plot moved. After a few mangas, my reading speed improved and I've been able to speed through mangas much faster. Fantasy or something with a lot of jargon still slows me down but it's getting better.

So yeah it's like finding the right weights to work out with. If it's too heavy and it eats up all your energy, then it's not gonna be much help. If it's too light then it won't develop your muscles. If it's the right size, it will allow you to work out with it repeatedly while still challenging you. In my case, it has enough new words to give me the sense that I'm learning something new but not too much that it hinders my enjoyment, plus this furthers exposure of vocabulary I already know.

I guess this is a challenge on lower levels because you're heavily limited to what the textbooks have and material made for kids isn't necessarily material that's appropriate for everyone at lower levels. Like I was trying to review Spanish and I tried reading children's stories but it still had a lot of unknown vocabulary and not relevant to how I'd normally use Spanish. I mean, I went to Spain for travel so knowing names of animals isn't gonna be very relevant to me. How would you go about this for lower levels?",1624593995,InsomniaEmperor,5

[https://discord.com/invite/P7H7NxHf8Z](https://discord.com/invite/P7H7NxHf8Z)

The languages, which the server and its channels focus on, include:

\- **German, Dutch** and **all North Germanic languages** (even Faroese!)  
\- **All Slavic languages**! (even Sorbian or Ruthenian!)

\- **French, Italian, Latin, Romanian**, other Romance languages soon!

\- **Turkish**

\- **Greek**

\- **Lithuanian** and **Latvian**

\- **Hungarian**

\- **Finnish** and **Estonian**

We're also planning to branch out to other languages of the region (Spanish, Georgian, Armenian, Yiddish) as well, depending on the users demand. Now they can be freely used in #aliæ (other) channel, but they are going to have its own channels soon!

How are we different from the other servers?

1. Simple rules including ***the ban on speaking in English***, which means that the server is not about general conversations in English, but about actually learning the languages. However, every language other than English can be freely used.
2. We are not a server for all languages of the world, we focus on a specific region, so there is also a room for the less popular languages, unlike on the other servers, where such languages are put into the ""other"" channel. There could be a channel even for a minority language, as long as it will be active.",1624545790,Semorod,0

I finally got a vibration yesterday, and I can say the word ""Trill"" with the ""r"" vibrated and make the vibration itself. 

The problem I'm having is that I'm unable to pronounce Fs and Bs, and I'm starting to think it's because I'm doing it incorrectly and not so much because I'm new at it. The tutorials I'm watching show the tip of the tongue vibrate whereas the middle of my tongue is what vibrates for me. Not only this but my tongue is completely flat and touching the back of my teeth contrary to many tutorials. Is the placement for the trill different for different people or am I doing it incorrectly, and need to go back to the starting board?


TLDR: In trying to do the Alveolar Trill, my tongue vibrates only in the middle and contrary to many tutorials I've seen, my tongue doesn't vibrate on the tip but moreseo the middle. Am I misunderstanding how the trill is done or am I doing it and lack practice?",1624506165,Fortolaze,3

languagelearning,The Case for Not Memorizing Any Grammar (Not Studying Rules Until You Are Curious),"Hola a todos! Hello, and grab some popcorn because this is going to be a long post. Ever since I totally changed my language learning approach from mostly output to mostly input, I have had great success and so far, learning a foreign language has been a lot more fun. I have been following the teachings of Dr. Stephen Krashen (Perhaps too much, but time will tell) like I am one of his disciples. With that being said, one of his points really stood out to me, and I am seeing evidence, at least in my learning journey, that it is correct. 

In one of his videos, he mentioned something to the effect of: ""If you want to learn grammar, let it come up naturally while you are consuming comprehensible input. If you come across a piece of grammar that you find really fascinating then go ahead and look it up. But you should not be trying to memorize grammar point after grammar point"". 

With that being said, I had a great moment that reflects this advice, but unfortunately it needs a lot of background to explain how I did it. So here we go….

One of the ways I have been experimenting with the idea of comprehensible input is by watching Let's Plays in Spanish. For those of you that do not know what a ""Let's Play"" is, it's basically a video of someone playing a videogame where they narrate over the gameplay footage (exciting stuff I know). To most people, this activity would be extremely boring, but for many of us, it is actually an enjoyable activity for some reason. 

Anyway, I flipped on a Let's Play of Final Fantasy 1 (for GBA not the original one for the NES because I could not find a vid of the original one in Spanish ☹) and started watching. I'll admit that I am breaking my rule of comprehensible input a bit because I don't really get what he is saying most of the time, but let's gloss over that this time. 

While watching the video, the narrator entered a cave where some dwarves are trying to dig a passageway to the other side. The player needs to find some TNT to blow up the passageway (called nitropolvo in Spanish). The interesting part is that there is a room at the top of the cave where a blacksmith is waiting for you (and don't worry you don’t need to know any Spanish or any grammar to understand the point I am going to attempt to make). He says the following phrase:

""Si tuviera un poco de ese legendario metal, adamantita, podría forjar una espada mágica increíble!""

Now my Spanish is A1 certified only so its very difficult for me to use this as comprehensible input, but as soon as I saw the word ""Si"" I knew (from many years of experience playing the game and from watching other lets play's in my native tongue English) that the dwarf was saying something like: 

""If I had this legendary metal I could forge a special weapon"" (for the player….Sidenote: I don't know if I ever actually found what he needed darn it! What is the legendary weapon?)

Now (and this is where I risk totally getting this grammar point wrong and defeating my argument), I would have expected the first clause to use the conditional tense because he is saying a condition *If I had the legendary metal,* but the first clause uses the imperfect tense. ""That's strange"" I said to myself ""I wonder why it's using the imperfect tense instead of the conditional as the imperfect tense is usually used to talk about past events?""

So just out of pure curiosity, I whipped out my trusty copy of *Spanish Grammar in Context* and found the section on the imperfect tense. What I needed to know was not covered in the first rule, or the second, or the third, or the forth…. But was covered by the seventh and final rule of the book (which I assume the book feels is the least important rule). It is as follows:

""the imperfect can be used instead of the conditional, in colloquial speech"".

And just like that, I internalized that rule without memorizing it. If I had tried to memorize all 7 of those rules at some point in the past, there would be little or no chance of me being able to recall that 7th rule at just the right time that I needed it to understand what that dwarf was saying. Plus I would have wasted hours wallowing in pain as I tried to memorize each rule. Using this more natural approach of learning out of curiosity, I can recall it and will probably never forget it. Best of all it was effortless, the rule just flowed into me like water. Krashen wins again!

Thanks for reading this really long and specific example of how to learn grammar without memorizing rules. I am going to continue to try and learn the grammar in this fashion—only looking things up that I am interested in and not trying to memorize anything. Over time I should internalize a lot of grammar this way. 

Has anything like this happened to you? Perhaps you were able to memorize a series of rules and had success doing so. If that is the case, I would love to hear these thoughts even if they disprove what I just posted about (but would appreaciate it if everyone would just agree with me haha). What are your thoughts on this ""method""? 

Thanks!",1624500497,Economy_Wolf4392,15

I have decided that if I can't visit China, I will do my best to bring even a small portion of the feeling of immersion to me.  It's not so bad because it is much cheaper than a plane ticket, accomodations, etc.  Plus, it is also significantly less stressful... I have been in too many airports and on too many planes... now is not a time when I want to be on one.

Plan for the week:

1. Lesson with different tutor every morning.
2. Lesson with regular tutor every evening.
3. Head to a nearby city's Chinatown for an afternoon (restrictions permitting).
4. Attempt to find for order authentic Chinese food (not American Chinese food).
5. Bake an authentic pastry at home from China (I picked moon cakes).
6. Read from start to finish a three story graded reader of a couple hundred pages.
7. Spend some time on Tandem with a language partner.
8. Listen to more classical Chinese music.

Spanish (Not even A1, but understand surprisingly a lot, probably due to Italian, just working through a textbook)

French (Not started yet aside from some playing around in Duolingo)

So, I had the plan to start learning Spanish and to brush up my Russian and to improve my English a bit as well. English is not a big deal, since I basically use it every day (but I am learning new words with wordup, which helps a lot). For Russian, I am watching some Russian Youtubers and I am reading short stories, specifically written for learners.

But how should I go about my romance languages? I wanted to start learning Spanish seriously this year, but I feel like I haven't gotten anywhere with my Italian yet and maybe I should improve that first before jumping to such a similar language? I feel if I focus on Spanish now, I would forget all the Italian I learned and that would be a huge waste of time then. Should I get to a solid B1 in Italian first? I feel it would make learning Spanish, and also being able to tell them apart, easier later on. Oh and French is really not a priority right now, just a ""nice to have"" on my list.

languagelearning,B1/B2 German in 3 months?,"This time last year I (21F) started learning German, was very motivated, and was able to achieve A2 in 2 months and maintained it for some time. I have a good grasp of the grammar and the accent and pronunciation are not an issue for me. 
However, I fell off the wagon so bad that my vocabulary is back to A1 rn and wasn't consistent in using the language everyday. And I'm moving to Germany on October and just realized it's coming so fast and I've been procrastinating for a very long time! I'm basically panicking rn and very stressed out over this. 

My question is, do you think it's realistic for me to expect to reach around B1 or B2 in 3 months? German was my first language and am learning it again after 16 yrs (if that's worth mentioning).
Also, do you have any advice on how I can learn the language and build my vocab faster?

languagelearning,Routine Changes: Effect on Study,"Like many people, I built my language study habits on routines that are generally unchanging during the day. It was funny to see how on the first day of my one-week off work, it all broke down. 

Normally, my study day goes like this:

1. Nicos Weg while I drink my morning (decaf) coffee.
2. Pimsleur on my morning walk or at the gym (now that the gym is open; I like to pretend the mask means no one hears the random German coming out of my mouth).
3. Easy German podcast on the drive to work. 
4. Grammar study and/or writing practice on my break at work. 
5. Graded reader chapter or two before bed.
6. Optional but frequent: Passive study by watching TV in German, attempting to read German Reddit, etc. 

On my first day off, it looked like this:

1. No morning coffee (out of beans). This didn't trigger my usual first study session of the day. I got started on some chores around the house instead. 
2. Went for a hike with family instead of doing my solo workout. 
3. Carpooled to hike, so no German podcast in the car. 
4. There is no work this week, so there was no break to trigger a study session. Meanwhile, a book in English I'd been on the waiting list for at the library came in. I started reading that. 
5. I kept reading that book. 
6. Yep... still reading that book. 

This ended up being only the second day I've done less than 90 minutes of study since starting German (the first was when I had a relatively miserable reaction to the second Moderna shot [worth it!]). 

It's certainly not a big deal to miss a day, but I thought it was interesting how just a couple changes snowballed into no study at all. I'm just as excited as usual to study today, and now that I'm aware I need to actually plan time for it rather than rely on my usual triggers, I'm also sure I'll get it done. I'm on vacation for the rest of this week, but as I am a morning person and my husband is not, I have plenty of time to get 2-3 hours of study in before he even wakes up (and before anything in this town opens up). Much of that I can do with headphones on while exploring a new place. I will doubtless find a nice park or wooded area to do my book and Nicos Weg studying. 

I'm curious how many of you have missed entire study sessions because of a routine change and, if you have, how easy or hard it was to get back on track.",1624453286,LeenaJones,3

languagelearning,"Korean, Spanish, Chinese: Questions about prioritizing and which one(s) to learn","I've recently taken an interest in trying to learn foreign languages as a way to improve myself and keep learning new things. I've zeroed in on these 3 for different reasons:

(1) Korean - I'm Korean American, my ability is probably that of a 10-12 year old in terms of speaking, writing, reading, etc. If I decide to improve my Korean, I have very ambitious goals, I want to get to professional level proficiency. I think I know how to get there, I just need to put the work in if I set that as a goal.

(2) Spanish - I took this for 2 years way way way back in HS, I think the biggest pro would be it would be fairly easier to learn being an English speaker and having had some exposure to it. I also have lots of potential language partners due to having friends that speak fluent Spanish. 

(3) Chinese - I think this would be the toughest. No prior learning. Knowing Korean gives me a bit of help because lots of Korean words are derived from Chinese, but that's a small thing. My motivation for this is that my in-laws speak Chinese and I always wanted to be able to converse with them in Chinese.

As you can see these are all divergent languages and I have different levels of proficiency I want to hit, with Korean being the most ambitious.

How do you/would you explain how far along you are in learning a language to people who aren't familiar with it?

&gt;  
&gt;Becoming fluent in a second language is difficult. But for adults, is it impossible? Short Wave hosts Maddie Sofia and Emily Kwong dissect the ""critical period hypothesis,"" a theory which linguists have been debating for decades — with the help of [Sarah Frances Phillips](https://sarahfphillips.com/), a Ph.D. student in the linguistics department at New York University. 

Summary: While it's easier for children to acquire language, adults can pick up a second language too.  It just requires more effort to unlearn old habits.  The story also pushes back on the notion (as many on this sub also rightly do) that one has to have native-like pronunciation to be a successful second-language learner.  It's about being able to communicate in your TL.

I understand they are the ""enemy"" but it is just beneath us as a country to have to pretend that we translate North Koreans as well as other State media and officials. 

If no one know what I'm talking about I'll try to find some examples but for example today's story by NBC quoted the North Korean's Kim Yo Jong as saying that:

 “The expectation, which they chose to harbor the wrong way, would plunge them into a greater disappointment.""

I never have much problem understanding the translations, it's just they always strike me as odd compared to how even tribes living out in the Amazon are translated. It seems the translators always choose the most awkward phrasing and way of saying it when there are more natural translations. I'm no translator but my mind automatically switched that last clause to ""...would upset them even more."" Because that makes it make sense to me. I don't know.

 It's just that North Korean translations always SOUND like a foreigner. I don't ever get that same feeling from any other professional translations of state officials. It's it's own unique style of translation and it's very annoying because it seems it's done on purpose. And it's unnecessary. We know they are not the brightest country but exaggerating their difficulties with speech is stretching it.

languagelearning,"I made a tool to practice languages by translating short phrases - https://langflipflop.com. English, Spanish, Russian.","The idea is very simple: you select a text from the list of texts, read it sentence-by-sentence and try to translate it in your head, and then tap/click the sentence to compare what you had in mind to the suggested translation. It may look like yet another reading app, but the intended use case is rather different. The idea is to exercise translating from the language you know to a language you are learning.

For example, try translating famous quotes from popular TV series:

- Friends ([English-&gt;Spanish](https://langflipflop.com/texts/tv-quotes-friends?lang1=en&amp;lang2=es&amp;i=1),  [English-&gt;Russian](https://langflipflop.com/texts/tv-quotes-friends?lang1=en&amp;lang2=ru&amp;i=1), [Spanish-&gt;English](https://langflipflop.com/texts/tv-quotes-friends?lang1=es&amp;lang2=en&amp;i=1), [Spanish-&gt;Russian](https://langflipflop.com/texts/tv-quotes-friends?lang1=es&amp;lang2=en&amp;i=1), [Russian-&gt;English](https://langflipflop.com/texts/tv-quotes-friends?lang1=ru&amp;lang2=en&amp;i=1))

- Game of Thrones ([English-&gt;Spanish](https://langflipflop.com/texts/tv-quotes-game-of-thrones?lang1=en&amp;lang2=es&amp;i=1), [English-&gt;Russian](https://langflipflop.com/texts/tv-quotes-game-of-thrones?lang1=en&amp;lang2=ru&amp;i=1), [Spanish-&gt;English](https://langflipflop.com/texts/tv-quotes-game-of-thrones?lang1=es&amp;lang2=en&amp;i=1), [Spanish-&gt;Russian](https://langflipflop.com/texts/tv-quotes-game-of-thrones?lang1=es&amp;lang2=en&amp;i=1), [Russian-&gt;English](https://langflipflop.com/texts/tv-quotes-game-of-thrones?lang1=ru&amp;lang2=en&amp;i=1), [Russian-&gt;Spanish](https://langflipflop.com/texts/tv-quotes-game-of-thrones?lang1=ru&amp;lang2=es&amp;i=1))

I started it when I realized that my Spanish was very one-directional. I read and watched a lot of videos in Spanish and I had no problems understanding anything, but when I needed to say or write something I was completely stuck. So I started looking for proper materials and/or tools to practice translating from English to Spanish, but I couldn't find anything that I really liked. I wanted the exercises to be bite-sized, to be based on the language that people actually speak rather that the literary language, and for it to be very easy to switch between one language and another. There are apps that are somewhat similar to that, but not quite. So, I made https://langflipflop.com. Most texts are collections of some random phrases about a topic, but other types of texts are available too.

Please check it out and tell me what you think! And join r/langflipflop to learn more :-)

languagelearning,French or Italian — please help! I’m extremely torn,"I’m sure I’m going to get many “learn Uzbek” answers, but here goes. I’m very stuck on which language to pursue first (hopefully I’ll get around to both at some point!). I prefer Italian culture (cinema, literature, opera, the classical history, overall architecture and design) and I enjoy the sound of the language more, but there are aspects of French culture I absolutely love (cuisine, Deco architecture, modern art, the south). Stereotyping here, but the generally more exuberant Italian attitude also appeals to me. I have a pretty good French accent, while I struggle with the alveolar trill and double consonants in Italian. I’ve heard that many well-educated/professional Italians will have at least conversational French or English. I’m very stuck, but I guess the question is, would I have an easier time in Italy with French, English, and extremely basic Italian than I would have in the France/the Francophonie with Italian, English, and beginner French? 

I took a couple years of French in school — over a decade ago now — and one of my closest friends is half-French and lived there til 18. I don’t have anyone immediately available to practice Italian with.  I’ve traveled within both countries (although I’ve spent more time in France than Italy and never made it south of Rome). Exploring the countries hasn’t made the choice any easier. I loved everywhere I went in Italy, which wasn’t the case for France, but the parts of France I loved, I *really* loved.  On the work front I can make a good case for the utility of both languages. I’m in the US, if that has an impact.

languagelearning,What is my native language?,"Please bear with me, I am on mobile and this might be confusing so I'm going to try to explain as best as possible.

I am a third culture kid, my parents were immigrants and instead of enrolling us in a local school they enrolled my siblings and I in an American school. By the time I started speaking I was exposed to 3 different languages. At home our ""native"" language, at nursery the local language and soon after.. English (my older siblings already spoke English and I began school when I was just shy of 3 years old).

In job applications or surveys I am often asked about my native language. I find it misleading to respond with my actual native language as I can barely read or write in that language. If native language is based on where I was born not where I'm from (we are still deeply rooted in our home country but I was born in the country my parents moved to), I also am not proficient enough. I speak, write and read the language as well as you'd expect a foreign language student to. English, however, is my absolute strong suit. People often ask if I am American because of my accent even though I've only been there once. In my opinion it should be the answer but by definition it isn't, so isn't it also misleading to respond with English? Hence the question, what is my native language?",1624373741,absentpresence142,15

My name is Frank and I am 28 years old. I am from Germany, so German is my mother tongue. I would like to move to the US and therefore I am constantly looking to improve my English. My goal is to become as close to the level of a native speaker as possible. I took the TOEFL exam in 2018 and scored 107 out of 120 points, which means my English at that time was at a C1 level. In the meantime, I completed my master's studies completely in English and hopefully I would score even highter today.

My question: Would practicing my other languages (Russian-B1/B2, Spanish-A1, Italian-A2) hurt my pursuits to attain a General American accent or is it possible to master one language completely and be at an intermediate level in a few others?

languagelearning,"Ideas for a ""returning"" language learner","Anyone here who picked up language study after years of being inactive? I am returning to my study of Japanese after 10 years, and am quite overwhelmed by the different methods I could use now.

Background: Majored in linguistics in university, took Japanese classes for a total of 1-2 years, then spent a year as an exchange student. So most if not all of my language learning was really done in a physical classroom with textbooks setting. Though I became fluent enough for daily life, I still struggled with kanji and vocabulary, which led to comprehension gaps in conversations. I left the country being able to converse but... most of the time, especially for specific/technical topics, I feel like I only half-understand what people are saying and just get by with context and some clarifications. 

After graduation, I started working for an NPO and haven't been able to practice at all. My only exposure to the language for many years was Jpop. Only last year did I start watching anime and Jdrama again. 

This time around I really just want to be able to reconnect with Japanese and Japanese-speaking friends since more of them are on social media now compared to the past years. I'd like to be able to read their posts without using the See Translation feature, to make posts of my own, and to enjoy J-media without subs or minimal translation help. It's also an attempt to get up from a mental health slump, hoping to replace unhealthy coping habits with some active learning.

Generally, we can speak about simple topics and ask basic questions to one another. However; I have noticed a lot of the time they cannot understand what I am saying at all.

I recognized that this is likely due to my use of tones. I understand that basic sentences or questions don't rely on tones as much, because the words are heard frequently in everyday conversation. This is where my confusion starts.

How can I better master the use of tones? Sometimes I use the pinyin translation without stressing the tones too much and they can totally understand, other times I will use basic words and not execute the tone flawlessly and the person will look at me like they are totally lost.

I’ve recently been watching a lot of Chinese shows (Cdramas) on Netflix which piqued my interest in learning Mandarin. I’ve picked up a few Mandarin phrases, which is exciting, but the only thing I’m nervous about is learning Hanzi— I think that’s what Chinese letters are called but someone correct me if I’m wrong. I’ve been learning Spanish for 5 years and I feel like it was easier because the letters were the same except for the “ñ.” Since Mandarin is a lot different than what I’m used to, can someone tell me the best way to learn it? I’m trying Duolingo but since it’s kinda unstructured I was having some trouble with keeping up with it. Any suggestions from someone who knows Mandarin or who has learned it?

languagelearning,The Struggle of Transitioning from Reading to Listening Comprehension,"tl;dr Looking for methods to transition from subtitle aided comprehension to pure listening comprehension or comprehension without subs (the obvious one being just to turn them off and practice)

My reading comprehension in my target language is around B1 (maybe even scratching B2) I would say (My TL has Latin script which is the same as my NL).

My pure listening comprehension isn't even \*that\* bad.

I'm mostly watching videos and shows with TL subtitles but I noticed that my listening comprehension, by that I mean understanding everything that is said by purely listening is worse than I thought.

Also, I sometimes have this weird thing where I comprehend and differentiate certain heard words by visualizing the word's text with its letters first, instead of going straight to understanding the actual meaning. (this tends to happen with Anki words more often but I'm not sure about that)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, are there any methods to aid me in this process?

I've thought about exercises like maybe trying to transcribe what I'm hearing but that could also maybe worsen it.

I could also try to listen to every small passage over and over again until I get it right maybe.

&amp;#x200B;

Lemme know if you got any ideas or tried any methods.

Recommendations for (preferably free) apps or extensions for this purpose would also be appreciated.

On the one hand people talk about simply reading a lot using intensive input, which I have done up until now (I have read about 25 full novels so far) but now I find that I have a lot of words that I recognise but that don't come to mind when I'm having an actual conversation. I also find that I keep coming across the same new words but never actually learn them unless I put them in Anki.

I remember reading that the best way to learn words is to actually create a sentence with that new word. I do this for my Anki cards but I am just wondering if anyone has had success by reading a lot but mentally creating a sentence for new word they come across, or even for words they recognise but could not put into a sentence in regular conversation. For reference there are probably 2 words per page in a general novel that I would not recognise so this wouldn't be too oneroud (though there would be more new words per page in an older or stylised book).

languagelearning,What language should i take? French vs Mandarin Chinese,"I‘m an in incoming freshman wanting to major in International Politics &amp; Economics (one interdisciplinary major, not double major). One of the requirements is that we have to learn a language, although I would have wanted to do so anyway. I want to become a diplomat and have always been interested in languages. Currently I‘m fluent in german (grew up in a german speaking country when until i was 14), in english (obviously), dutch, and somewhat in French (i took AP French, can watch TV/news in french, write academic papers, and have conversations). I also took 2 years of Chinese in high school.

I‘m not quite sure what language I should choose in college. While i took both in high school, i want to choose one partly because it would be a huge course load to take two (not even sure that could work logistically) and I want to really focus on one and get the most of it. I absolutely enjoyed learning and speaking both. 

I‘m right now leaning towards choosing Chinese because I feel like it’s easter to practice/maintain french in my free time post college. I also *already know* french, although Im not at a native fluency level (but i could certainly work in french/with french people). So i feel like this might be the best opportunity i get to learn Chinese (since it’s pretty hard to learn when having to simultaneously work, etc.).

However on the other hand I know I could probably get to a native fluency level in french, which i‘m not sure i can do in chinese with only 4 years.

Considering that I also want a future career in diplomacy is there an advantage to either language i haven’t thought of? I think both languages could be very handy since china is becoming a global power and french is spoken in so many countries.

languagelearning,Adopting a target language character/persona,"Mandatory prologue: 

I am not a native English speaker, this works for me, listening to random strangers on the Internet may cause stupidity. Also I may be kicking in open doors.

&amp;#x200B;

As adults, most of us have multiple roles in our lives. We are sons, daughters, siblings, parents, partners, professionals, customers and so on.

Many of us also have distinct characters or character traits associated with these roles. Consciously or not, we have adopted a particular voice, volume, pitch, pronunciation, speaking rate, vocabulary and even posture when talking to our mothers which may or may not be the same as when we are talking to our friends. (And this particular differentiation may possibly be the first we learn, even if it isn't consciously.) 

Occasionally, a \*new\* role is thrown at us out of the blue, and we need to find out the proper character to fit the role. One way to cope with this is to emulate. And just as kids pick their 'cool character' by mixing and matching vocabulary, clothes, mannerisms and posture from pop culture, adults also tend to emulate people perceived successful in whatever role is relevant.

I have come to realize that this insight is useful when learning a foreign language. It is definitively easier for me to pronounce Spanish words properly or come up with complete sentences if I mentally dress up in my Spanish character. Sure, my character may be simplistic, stereotypical and exaggerated. So are kids' 'cool character' until they grow into it. (Eventually. Maybe.) So, I lower my pitch and verbalize the words and dialogue how I imagine my target language character would pronounce the sentences.

With time and practice, this new character we pretend to be is evolved and refined into something which is 'true(r)'. 

So:

* Find/invent/imagine a target language character. No, we're not talking D&amp;D level specifications here. Some public figure speaking your target language may also work.
* ""Become"" that character when doing verbal target language exercises. Or when creating text in your target language.
* If you need to dress up, feel free... But otherwise, it is a mental thing. Voice, pitch, posture, mannerisms, etc.
* Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.

&amp;#x200B;

languagelearning,Language learner beginner questions,"Bonjour! 
First time language learner here and I have a few questions regarding recommended resources, time scheduling and concerns. 

The first thing I would like to ask about is what resources you would recommend for learning French. People are always quick to point out that there are a ton of resources out there but they rarely go into what's good to use and what's not good to use so I would like to know what resources you would recommend that are GOOD and what you think of what I'm currently using and if they're worth using or not.

Duolingo: Obviously I use Duolingo.  Right now I'm using the ""waterfall technique"": where I do the first five lessons to blue followed by lesson 6 to blue lesson 1 to green then lesson 7 to 2 and lesson 2 to green etc. etc. My main question here is whether I should split my learning on Duolingo into chunks or do it all in one sitting? Should I split my Duolingo courses up throughout the day or should I do them all at once? My main complaint with Duolingo is that often times the speaker will speak so fast the words just blur together and I often end up getting the answer wrong because I don't hear something small but important. I also make sure to type my answer out instead of using the wordbank which makes the aforementioned issue even worse for me.

Memrise:(Trial) Another app I use similar to Duolingo. It supplements my Duolingo courses well since It not only teaches me some different words compared to Duolingo but uses actual audio from native speakers with each word. Right now I'm still learning single words so I'm not sure if I will suffer from the same problem where the words in a sentence just blend together like in Duolingo. Another thing is the fact the app doesn't really have courses like Duolingo does so I'm unsure exactly the best amount of time I should invest in a day alongside my Duo courses.

Coffee Break French(Spotify) Not really a resource since I don't really invest any time into it compared to the other two and I only listened to the first lesson twice since I'm unsure if it would be a good thing to learn with. I really like that the speaker gives you both the English and French meaning but my main thing is that they speak slowly enough and repeat themselves so the words don't get lost into each other like in Duolingo.

Busuu: (Trial) I liked this one during the free first few courses they offered but its very similar to Memrise and Duolingo and I'm unsure how it stacks up to those two. The trial also doesn't offer much in the way of review so I doubt whatever I get out of It would stick with me. 

Primsleur: (Trial) Yet another app I'm testing out. I've actually not gotten into this one yet and since they only offer 1 free course I'd like to know if its worth the money before I do.

French 2020(Assiml): Seems to throw you into the deep end of the pool from the start. Once again I like that the sentences are spoken slow and clearly compared to Duos faster word blending method but other than that I find even the starting course MUCH harder than the other apps. The little notes are nice but there dosn't seem to be a way to review after you learn something before they throw you the quiz at the end which I often can not get through without getting something simple wrong. Maybe I'm just using it wrong.


TV5Monde: I have this app installed as well. It definitely has a LOT of content on it but I find it quite confusing to navigate around. Is there no rhyme or reason as to the order in which I'm supposed to do the content and I can pick whatever I find interesting or necessary? I notice some of the videos have tags such as A1 which I know is the beginner level but that still leaves a WHOLE lot of stuff to go through.

French Story Book: I have an app for French story books for the future but obviously I'm not using it at the moment. 

Would you recommend I go further into any of these? The main things I'm struggling with right now are pronunciation of some of the sounds ( I think I have the ç sound down as it sounds similar to the English s. (Also how do you type a capital ç?) But the nasal sounds are quite confusing to me and I'm not sure if I do the R correctly. 

Next thing I would like to ask is time allocation. Is it better to do all my studying on an app in ONE sitting or to break it up and do smaller chunks throughout the day? Also how much time should I dedicate to the various apps I use? Ideally I would also like to work on writing skills as well but right now that's not really possible since id just be rehashing the same sentence over and over again. 

The final thing I would like to deal with is a concern of mine. Even though I can remember what a word means sometimes I often forget whether its masculine or feminine and goes with Le or La. Is this normal? Does remembering the gender take longer than remembering what the word means? Also I find some words are harder to remember than others to begin with and even after only a day I've completely forgotten what they mean. Is that something I should be concerned with?",1624154281,SilverWolf2k21,5

languagelearning,Struggling with motivation and wondering why I decided to do this (again),"A couple months ago, I decided to pick up Spanish again after 5+ years. Prior to this, I'd only learned it because it had at first been a required class and then I was pressured into keeping it up because I apparently showed some aptitude for it (I don't think so). 

I posted to /r/language_exchange at first, thinking that I remembered enough to hold a conversation...long story short, I don't. 

Ever since I've picked it up again, everybody who knows about it has asked me why I'm learning again since it serves no practical purpose. And I don't really have a good answer to that question. I'm not in school anymore, don't need to know it for work, don't plan to travel, etc. The only real reason I have is that language is a 'use it or lose it' kind of thing, and I don't want to lose it entirely. I'm starting to wonder if that's really a good enough motivation to keep studying. 

I also live in a fairly conservative area of the US, and over the years have gotten some snide comments about the language I was choosing to study. My previous argument was that as long as I was learning a language, Spanish was still more practical than French or German, but now that I'm out of school I don't really have that as an excuse. I'm really starting to wonder why I should really bother learning something I don't *need* to know. I don't know...I always kind of feel like I have to defend my decision whenever the topic comes up. I'm starting to think that maybe spending time and energy learning something because...I just like to know stuff for the sake of knowing it, I guess?...may not be the best idea after all.",1624148961,Nefarious__Nebula,16

languagelearning,Talent vs Effort in Foreign Language Learning,"I've been wondering about this topic for a while...whether being extremely successful in learning foreign languages is more based on innate talent or strong effort.  In my case, I have advanced proficiency now in Spanish, Catalan and Portuguese.  I am from a monolingual American English home and grew up with only English in my life until the age of 14 at which point I started studying Spanish in high school.  I now, after many years of study, frequently have conversations in which native speakers think that I myself am a native speaker of each of these languages.  Questions and comments including ""What part of Spain are you from?"" or ""Are you from Brazil or Portugal?"" or ""I thought you were Catalan!"" or ""I thought you were from Latin America!"" have been common over the years.

I also have intermediate proficiency in French after several months of study, can understand a majority of Italian with no experience in learning it, and have near 100% understanding of Galician after a few months of study.  You can see I have a passion for the Romance language family.  But I haven't limited myself to them.  I also studied 3 semesters of Mandarin in college but at this point my Mandarin is dormant and would need some serious activation to be useful again.  As far as I know I am the only student at my university to ever earn an A+ in multiple Spanish courses, a Portuguese course, and a Mandarin course.  As of the past month I've been learning Modern Hebrew and it's turned into a true passion.

Anyway, what I want to point out is that I've put an incredible amount of time, effort, and study into the languages that I have achieved various levels of proficiency in.  I'm talking almost every day of my life for the past 15 years or so.

I don't like it when people tell me that I just have a talent for language learning that other people simply don't have.  I frankly don't think that's the case.  What I do have is a tremendous passion to learn and motivation to study every day.

What are your thoughts on the idea of talent vs effort in language learning?",1624135662,Barcelona_Dreaming,22

* **Thai:**

languagelearning,Do you ever feel like you're losing your native language?,"So I'm just wondering if I'm the only one.
I'm Italian and I used to read a lot and write a lot of short stories too. When I was about 17 I started only reading in English. I think I've only read one or two Italian novels in the last 15 years.

I'm fine with it, I work in academia so I need to write and read in English, I lived in an English speaking country, I think in English etc. etc.

At the same time I'd love to go back to writing narrative stuff. My problem is that I feel like I'm not confident enough in my English (regarding narrative/storytelling, so non scientific Eng) and I'm not confident in my Italian anymore. If I try to write in Italian, sometimes, the structure of my sentences is wrong, or the words I choose sounds weird (or too real? Like there's an extra emotional layer I need to be careful with).

languagelearning,Flashcards - worth the squeeze?,"Just like pretty much everyone else in this community, I have been using anki to create flashcards with the hopes of solidifying some vocabulary.

I find it very boring and feel like the time I spend on doing cards, could be invested better elsewhere.

So I'm thinking of dropping it altogether, or maybe change my approach. That brings me to my questions: 

Are there anyone in here who doesn't use flashcards, and in case yes, do you use any other special techniques to enforce new vocabulary or do you just rely on acquiring it naturally through immersion?

First some context: 
I have been learning French for something around 5 months now, some of it more actively, some more passively. I can comfortably understand simpler texts and audios and even some shows (I stated watching Les aventures de Tintin recently and was surprised to be able to follow the plot quite well).

I absolutely dread having to do Anki.

* At what point do you decide you've done enough new cards in a Speak session?
* Do you mark cards as ""Hard"" when you can't pronounce them easily? I would assume that ""Hard"" is for cards you can't remember easily, but when I do a card for the first time I can't really estimate how well or poorly I'm going to recall it thereafter.
* In Study mode, do you guys use Understand/Lecture to familiarize yourself with the cards in the module first before trying to record? I'm used to being presented with content first and then asked to either repeat it or synthesize it with existing knowledge.
* How are you guys using the Toolbox tools? There seems to be some overlap between the Quiz, Listening, and Flashcard modes. In a way, it might be better to use these to prime yourself for the module content before testing your recall in Speak mode.",1624072859,tabidots,6

languagelearning,Curiosities between Italian and other languages,"Just a random post I had fun making! 

As an Italian, I always found it cool how other languages had very similar words to Italian but either with the same concept but slightly different meaning OR  the exact same meaning but in other languages they are ""fancier"" words while in Italian they are basic vocabulary.
Let's start with some examples. In Spanish, the verb ""tener"" (IT:avere) means ""to have"", while in Italian ""tenere"" means ""to hold"" or ""to keep"". Then there's ""intender"" (IT:capire) which means ""to understand"", however, ""intendere""  in Italian means ""to insinuate"" , while in English ""to intend"" means a completely different thing.
In English, ""gentle"" (no direct translation in IT) is almost spelled the same as ""gentile"" but it means more ""kind"" rather than ""delicate"". 

And now for words that are basic vocab in Italian but more or less uncommon in English with the Italian version in parantheses: ascend (scendere), oscillate (oscillare), augment (aumentare), fluctuate (fluttuare), gyrate (girare), agitate (agitare), didn't state it above, however -&gt; insinuate (insinuare), comprehend (comprendere), to function (funzionare), content (contento) and many much more. 

False friends are fun, they are very similar words but with completely unrelated meaning, let's name some! Succedere -&gt; to happen, not ""to succeed"",  Agenda -&gt; schedule, not ""diary"" or one's beliefs, Argomento -&gt; topic, not ""argument"", Attuale -&gt; current/present, not ""actual"", Avvertimento -&gt; warning, not advertisement, Bravo -&gt; adjective for good people/animals, not ""brave"", Camera -&gt; room, not... camera, Eventualmente -&gt; possibly, not ""eventually"", Noioso -&gt; boring, not ""annoying"" and so, so, soooo many more.

languagelearning,My experience with learning russian,"Here I'll present my conclusion about my language learning path, I'll write why i gave up but also what did i find easy in my TL.

I've been learning russian for a year and a half. I've stopped only two months ago. I gave up because i didn't have any motivation left, any interest and because i came to dislike the language. It's not the first language I've tried to learn, as you can probably tell I'm not a native english speaker but a french native speaker. I've also learned some spanish mainly at school. I won't detail my method because I've tried a lot of them, but my method mainly consisted of Anki flash cards and reading simple texts then news articles, but i also listned to a big amount of audio ( almost all of папины дочки to only cite that).

&amp;#x200B;

I gave up mainly because of the difficulty that broke my motivation. I just wanna say that i was expecting something nearly impossible and that i was really ready to study it for 5 years, I was really determined.

The thing that was the easiest and the funniest definitely the easiest part, no problem at all. 

The second thing that was easy was the declensions. Let me be clear declensions aren't easy at all I'll talk about it later, but they aren't a major obstacle to comprehension after some exposure. After a lot of work you can actually read a text without struggling too much with declensions as you'll passively recognize them. That was a big surprise because i thought declensions were almost impossible to understand even passively.

Another good point is the amout of materials, with russian you just have materials everywhere, interviews, newspapers, free grammar books (they're the kings of hacking after all) but also youtube channels like ""russian with max"" or ""real russian club"" that are very well known and very good in my opinion. I also liked [this](https://www.alphadictionary.com/rusgrammar/), the best grammar i could find about verbs and consonantal shift. And of course even if i didn't touch it the literature is vast and rich.

&amp;#x200B;

Now comes the points that made me give up.

First the vocabulary, it's not the problem that i encounter but it is the most important in my opinion. The vocabulary is simply huge. In french a very well educated person knows about 20.000 words, i know this is not really an argument as it is very hard to count the numbers of words one knows, a normal russian person has a vocabulary of 70.000 words. Because these numbers don't mean much i'll illustrate, in russian you have a prefix and suffix system that is very developped, but i guess not as much as in finnish or hungarian. But the thing is that the prefix never have the same meanings, each prefix changes any root in an unpredictable way. Which means that for a learner the prefix system is unusable each word needs to be learned individually. Just check the number of derived words on wiktionary and you'll see why it is very hard if not impossible to surpass this. But, that is more of a personal statement, i think that most russian words are bland, very similar because of that suffix and prefix system, for example поведение определение продолжение посещение отражение just sound meaningless to my ears. And you have to take into account that these words decline and that verbs are even more subject to such modifications.

That brings me to the second hardest part the verbs. The conjugation in itself is hard mainly because of the consonantal shift that happens on rather arbitrary conditions. As a french I struggled a lot but i managed to be able to passively recognize conjugations and, sometimes i was able to conjugate verbs. The real struggle for me was actually their use. The perfective/imperfective system simply doesn't make sense for me in practice, like i can understand the theory behind I've read and heard it more than my own name, but in practice it is hell. When reading I was relying mainly on context to be able to understand when the action was taking place. It is even worsened by the number of verbs that is sumply crazy. It is the same thing than with vocabulary but worse because verbs are even more subject to that kind of changes. Simply take the number of verbs possible to say to drink, it is staggering.

Another problem about verbs but more specific is the verbs of motion, probably the most well know russian learner's nightmare. It simply is what i've described but worse, i gave up, after a month of learning them, when i tried to say to my russian friend ""I am going to uni"" and that my friend simply didn't understand what i was saying.

The third point for me are the prepositions. I know that the use of prepostions in languages are rather arbitrary. Here in russian it is simply impossible. Because prepositions goes with a case, and that the combination of these two can change anything c+instrumental is ""with something"" but c+genitive means ""from an inanimate object"". And I'm not even talking about the combination of prepositions and verbs or verbs of motions, a book wouldn't be enough. 

A more specific point, and I'm not really sure about it, is that russians have ahard time using synonyms? Let me be clear Russians have a billion words for everything and they very very often have two words for the exact same thing. But often they have two very similar words, and as a beginner I thought i could invert them, but when i did it was simply impossible for the people I was talking to to understand what i was saying. In french we often swap words that barely have anything to with one another and we just deduce the meaning from the context, but from my (small) experience it's absolutely not russians work.

Another point that i consider difficult but that i actually enjoyed is the pronunciation, it is hard but not even close to anything that i mentioned, the long consonant clusters and the abundance of sh sounds makes it hard and you will always sound like a foreigner no matter how hard you try but at least it's doable.

&amp;#x200B;

Now comes the moment where I talk about what I've learned about my own capacities. 

I suck at learning by heart, anki was helpfull but I was simply making so many mistakes that from a day to another i had too many cards to review it was unbearable.

After a while I'm sick of making mistakes, not only with anki but when making sentences with other russians because most of the time they wouldn't understand and simply ask me to translate in english (i wanna precise we met for the language)

I have hard time focusing on my progresses. I came to have a pretty decent passive comprehension level, I could read ""complex"" press articles and i could tell what's going on when people articulate and use simple vocabulary, but this still felt like it was completely useless and worthless, bc i was totally unable to produce anything in the language and bc i was unable to passively understand enough to enjoy anything in the language. So there was no way to enjoy.

&amp;#x200B;

My conclusions:

Most people here will disagree but I think that in order to learn a language that is much more difficult than yours you need to be a genius. Like normal people like me simply can't make it, our brains haven't been trained since birth to assimilates nearly a million words (counting every possible form of a word). Our brains haven't been trained to make sense out of non-sense. I think that as a french i can learn simple languages like western european languages ( still not perfectly as you can see with my english), and that difficult languages aren't for us. I also came to think that yes some languages are objectively more difficult than others , who would dare to say that french is harder than russian polish or japanese? I obviously sound salty, i am, and I might discourage some but I think I have said at least one or two things that are right. 

I've decided to stop learning languages as i am simply unable to, next year i might go in erasmus, i enlisted to learn a language as it was my dream but i feel no reason to break my head and will on something so useless again.

Thanks for your attention if anyone had the courage to read it all.

And sorry for all the mistakes",1624062987,ragedaile,32

I started learning serbian, since my parents both speak it. I've always had a basic knowledge of both languages, but my Serbian understanding has progressed a lot IMO. I thought rationally, and for me the smartest language to learn was serbian. The problem is that my dad is macedonian, and he wasn't really a fan of my choice... Of course he was a little happy that I actually was interested in learning, but he refused to talking with me in serbian, even though he speaks it everyday!  But anyways, the question I wanted to ask is if it's possible for me (15 years old) to learn 2 languages so similar at once?

languagelearning,Has anyone successfully re-learned a language they stopped speaking almost a decade ago (age ~18)?,"When I was 18-19 I stopped speaking Spanish because of a move. I used to be SO FLUENT, I used to know so many idioms and be able to express myself freely in Spanish, it was my primary language.

Spanish isn't my first language but I learned it in very early childhood (age 5.5-6) and it was the language that I was most comfortable and fluent in. My native language was way worse than my Spanish was at age 18.

Now I'm 27 and I've barely spoken it in a decade.  I've just moved to an environment where I have a chance to speak it again and was really excited up until I realized how choppy my speech had become. My receptive language skills are still perfect, I've always read and consumed a lot of Spanish media, but I just lost touch with all my old friends around age 18 and haven't had much of a chance to speak it.

Thing is I've recently began to want to speak Welsh instead of English whenever possible, this isn't the first time either, when I was a little girl I use to speak Spanish when possible over French or English which both impressed and annoyed my parents at the time, I had also studied basque in the past out of interest in the history and although I didn't get very far, I want to go back to that and will probably then get those same urges.

Two weeks ago I decided to learn Korean. This will be my 2nd try at learning a language. I had first attempted to learn French in high school and after a year I failed miserably but my love for Kdramas has me attempting once again. I decided to try a different approach and downloaded Lingodeer and Drops. I have learned and more importantly understood more in 2 weeks than I ever did in a classroom with a teacher in a year. I don't know if the class just moved on to quickly for me or if I just retain better with a gamified learning system. Can you guys recommend any additional apps that would complement the ones I am already using and loving?

Thanks!",1624041700,noangel1981,6

* [Episode 89: ‘I Before E’ and All That](https://historyofenglishpodcast.com/2017/01/23/episode-89-i-before-e-and-all-that/)

languagelearning,"For European Spanish learners, I highly recommend the show Aquí No Hay Quien Viva, and I finally figured out how to extract the subtitles from the full episodes","¡Hola a todos! I'm moving to Spain in the fall and I've been binging *Aquí No Hay Quien Viva* quite a lot recently to prepare. I've always wanted to study the subtitles to make notecards and what not, as it's a pain in the ass to transcribe while watching, but have yet to find any files online. But tonight I finally figured out how to use Chrome's Developer Tools to extract the subtitles! Not sure if this will work on other streaming services, but it does on this website at least.

So here's the [ANHQV.es](https://ANHQV.es) website where you can stream full episodes for free with optional subtitles (see *Capítulos Completos*)

And here are the steps to extract said subtitles

1. Navigate to the website and pick an episode of your choice (the website will open the link in a new tab)
2. On that new tab with the video, open *Developer Tools* (Option + Cmd + J on Mac, also under ""More Tools"" on the menu bar)
3. On the top menu bar of Dev Tools select *Network*
4. Refresh the page
5. In the center of the Developer Tools *Network* console, a number of lines will now populate. Under the Name column (far left), usually about 4 or 5 lines down, one line will be a .vtt file, named something like 1x02.vtt (for Season 1, Episode 2)
6. Right click on this file and hit Open in New Tab
7. In the new tab (which should be the .vtt transcript - note that a lot of the characters will look funky) right click anywhere on the webpage and hit Save As...
8. Save as a .vtt file
9. Convert the .vtt file to an .srt file using something like Happy Scribe's [subtitle converter](https://www.happyscribe.com/subtitle-tools/subtitle-converter) (note that conversion to PDF will *not* work, but txt seemed to work fine. .srt is by far the cleanest presentation though)
10. Open the .srt file in a subtitle editor program like [Jubler](https://www.jubler.org/) and voila! Study to your heart's content.

There are a lot of seasons to work through, but my plan is to make Anki cards with sentences from Season 1, and hopefully after studying those I'll be able to watch the later seasons with a lot less trouble.

Hope this helps someone out! Would be curious to see if a similar approach would work on other streaming sites.",1624004342,BassCulture,4

languagelearning,how to tweak the Mass Sentence approach when your TL marks features that your L1 doesn't?,"So, with Russian, my active ""conscious study"" time is spent on Glossika A1, Mango, and Memrise Pro at the moment.

Thanks to u/BusySea7's awesome [comment in another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/glossika/comments/moszco/best_ratio_of_reviews_to_new_sentences/gvpdp3e/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I've switched to using Glossika to practice Active Recall with every sentence. I realized I needed to do this when the reviews would randomly switch to Interpretation mode (speak the L2 sentence from L1 prompt) and I was like a deer in headlights.

However, now I am running into a problem. Specifically, my problem pertains to aspect and verbs of motion (which I think is quite advanced for A1 Russian), but in more general terms, this could be said of the Mass Sentence approach in general, in **instances where your TL marks important distinctions that don't exist in your L1.** (The stereotypical but extreme example is the Australian aboriginal languages that mark the verb with the compass direction the subject was facing when they did the action.)

Slavic languages explicitly mark aspect and very fine distinctions in types of motion, and, well, English doesn't. (Most of my experience is with languages that mark roughly the same kinds of distinctions as English but fewer of them, with gender I suppose being an exception but that's a purely lexical thing.)

When I am tested on comprehension (Memrise reviews) I do fine, but **when doing Active Recall** on Glossika, **I often can't recall the correct Russian verb from the English sentence since many of the sentences are too short or just don't give enough context.** (I am experiencing the same thing with Speechling, as many of the Low A1 cards don't prompt the right response from me, even when I know the Russian phrase.)

To give a more concrete example: for ""return"", all presumably with ""single-incidence/one-and-done"" aspect, I've encountered the following—

* I'm coming back next week -&gt; вернусь
* When's he coming back? -&gt; вернётся (same verb as above)
* When's he getting back? -&gt; возвращается (clearly the difference is not because of ""get back"" vs. ""come back"", which is unique to English)
* I'm coming back at \[future time\]. -&gt; возвращаюсь (same verb as above)
* We're coming back at \[future time\]. -&gt; возвращаемся (same verb; this is from Rocket Russian, which I checked out briefly)

Through Glossika alone I've encountered 3 different verbs in various conjugations for ""leave/go out"" (отправляется, уезжаю, уходит) and another for ""go out"" via Memrise (гулять). And then of course I've come across quite a few other verbs of motion through all 3 courses.

Can I understand them when I hear them? Sure.

Can I recall them without any kind of L2 prompt? Less than half the time, but when I can, it's because I memorized a sequence of words, not internalized the meaning.

If you've used the Mass Sentence approach (through Glossika or otherwise) with an L2, did you experience this? With what language(s?)? And how did you overcome it?",1623950498,tabidots,7

Russian fighters with ""Kh"" in their name, like ""khabib""...oh bozhe moj I hate it! the speaky guys will be like ""oh look at that Kabib hit the dude!"" I'm sorry?! KAbib? DUDE! the h is there for a reason! In russian it's хабиб, the kh is gutteral, yet obviously it's a k because english is dumb.

some people actually say it somewhat right by saying ""habib"" which is allowable, kh doesn't exist in english and h is the closest equivalent, i get it. It gives me so much joy when an announcer actually goes the full gutteral and says it right, I swear to god. someone's ear will be dangling from his head due to an elbow and I'll be spouting off my anger of how they mispronounced someone's name.

languagelearning,Native English speaker interested in learning Russian,"As the title says, I am a native English speaker who is interested in learning Russian. What would be my best course of action to learn to speak Russian? I understand that Russian is a difficult language to learn, so I don't think I would have much success with one of those language learning apps where you more or less teach yourself. I have looked into a few of the local community colleges in my area (Philadelphia, PA, and the surrounding suburbs) and it seems that none of them offer Russian courses. I have also tried searching for private schools/businesses but it seems that most of them are geared more towards ESL rather than teaching English speakers a new language.

languagelearning,Learning two similar languages at the same time,"Hello all! I used to enjoy learning languages when I was younger. I'm a complete grammar geek and find it quite easy to remember rules. Sadly, after moving to the UK English made me lazy and I stopped learning. A few months ago I finally rediscovered the hobby and it brings me a ton of joy every day.

That being said, I've always wanted to learn two specific languages and I'm getting impatient about starting on the second one. I am currently slowly self-learning French. I'm still at the present tense level as of now, but I finally decided to set some more defined goals and intend to speed up in the next few weeks. I also really want to learn Italian (I had a few very basic classes in the past).

As these languages are quite similar, I'm wondering if you have any advice on the level I should get to in French before starting with Italian. I realise different people have different experiences - some mix the languages up, some don't have any difficulties - but I would very much appreciate if you could share your experiences and/or advice.",1623938474,mp490_,19

languagelearning,Serious question: Why aren't more people learning Mandarin?,"Hello reader, I am a Canadian who has been learning Mandarin for almost 1 year now. I have really enjoyed the experience and have developed a deeper understanding of China's rich and ancient history. 

Here is my question: Why aren't more people learning Mandarin compared to other languages? Every language learning forum or app always puts WAYYY more emphasis and effort into their Spanish, French, and Hebrew courses, etc. I understand this is likely because more people are interested in learning these languages over Mandarin. For example, I see so much Youtube content relating to learning Japanese, a  language with only 128 million native speakers around the world, compared to the relatively limited content online regarding learning Mandarin even though there are over 1.6 billion Chinese people and tons of other countries that use Mandarin to communicate (yes, I know that there are many dialects in China and not everyone uses Mandarin).

I am not trying to bash any other language. I understand that everyone has their own motivations and goals. I just don't understand why more people aren't interested in learning this historically impactful and hugely relevant and growing language.

NOTE: When I visited Japan and spoke a little bit of Japanese to the locals, they didn't really react too much even though I am clearly white. Whenever I speak to Chinese nationals in Mandarin, they are always EXTREMELY surprised and generally ask me several questions regarding my experience learning the language.",1623937747,quickdr4w_,194

languagelearning,"Improving phone (audio) awareness, or listening with just audio vs also video.","TL;DR at the end.

I believe getting just the phonemes right is not enough to sound native-like. In English, the /t/ in top and stop sounds different. Even though it doesn't change the meaning, you will sound ""off"" if you get it wrong.

That means, I have to be aware of phones. My strategy so far has been to abandon all written media, and avoiding speaking, so that I don't (sub)vocalize and fossilize my bad pronunciation resulting from incomplete awareness of the sounds of the language. That means, just watching TL media without subtitles.

However, I have a hunch that this will not bring enough improvement for me to be able to speak with the correct phones. Example in Japanese, as of now, I'm aware that the aspiration of a phoneme is different depending on if it's the first sound in a word, or successive. I attribute that to my native language already having a phonemic different between aspiration. I'm seeing that I'm still getting AFAIK Japanese only sounds wrong in my head as I listen. I don't hear the Japanese ""hi"", I hear the English ""hi"", if I'm not paying attention. I hear the English ""shi"" instead of the Japanese equivalent. This is hard because the difference ISN'T phonemic.

Now, I bring this up because, I was listening to a song and I wasn't particularly focused on the meaning or the visuals. I noticed that the sound I heard ""shi"" was different from the English like ""shi"" that I was hearing. I am attributing this to me listening to it with my brain not focusing on other parts like visuals or the meanings. I used to think I would pick these up naturally just from watching a lot and having my subconscious work on it, but now I don't. I believe you must just listen and focus on the sounds if you want to improve.

TL;DR. You must put all your attention to ONLY the sounds of a language if you want to improve your listening/speaking/audio awareness enough that you can hear the actual phone being spoken enough to replicate it and speak. Not even just watching a lot without the written media can do that.

This is still just a theory so this is why I'm putting this up for discussion. Thank you.",1623926935,-DivineGod-,0

I've been learing German for 6 years now but I've made little progress because the curiculum is s h i t and not at all helpful for learing a language.

languagelearning,Advice on improving speaking skills?,"Q: What kind of activities have y'all found particularly helpful for improving speaking abilities (in addition to language exchanges)?

Background:  I've been learning Swedish in my free time for a little over a year and would say that I'm somewhere between B1 and B2, depending on which skills you're looking at. I don't live in Sweden. My current routine consists of a lot of input (reading books, listening audiobooks, radio, podcasts) and, less frequently, learning/reviewing grammar. I also have a language exchange partner, and we usually meet once a week.

My comprehension is coming along really well - I can understand podcasts and radio without too much effort, and when reading novels, I typically come across between 5-15 words a page that I don't know. However, while my understanding is getting better all the time, my speaking is pretty rough and doesn't seem to be improving much through my weekly language exchange.

I'm wondering what activities would be the most helpful in getting my speaking skills closer to my passive ones. Unfortunately I don't have the time/energy to add another weekly exchange meeting or to do lots of writing practice right now (my master's program and work have me pretty wiped out at the moment), but I would probably be able to devote more time after this summer.

Since my time is limited right now, I thought about recording myself speaking for 5-10 minutes every day. I was also wondering if there's a better way to prep for my weekly language exchanges or something I should be doing after the meetings to help get the most out of them. Would be really interested in hearing what other people have found most effective!",1623849835,Medium_Background,12

I’ve had a lot of bad experiences with language exchanges and I don’t have much desire to keep seeking them out.

I find often the other person doesn’t want to help me with their language and just wants to speak English. When we get to the part where I can practice German, they just look bored and uninterested and often start doing other things like using their computer or various other things.

I have found one partner who actually does help me but most of my experiences were bad.

Now in Greek I am hesitant to seek a partner due to all of my poor experiences 

With German I prefer to just pay italki teachers to practice with but it gets expensive doing too many.

Are there any other alternatives to practice?

languagelearning,Forgetting mothers tongue...,"Context(You can skip to *question* since context might not be needed):

I have completely forgotton my native language, its as if i never spoke it and this is why.
I lived in germany until i was 8, i could speak 2 languages (german &amp; english) and i could understand a third language (yoruba) but could barely speak it. This was the case because i spoke german in school and everywhere i went but my family couldnt speak german. They only spoke english and yoruba. So i would use english to speak to my parents and they would use yoruba for words they didnt know in english. 

When i was 8 my uncle convinced my parents to move to england. We all moved  to england and here was where the problem was. I had no reason to speak german, no one i knew spoke german, every show i watched in germany was in english, and from what ik even english music is quite popular in germany. Im also dyslexic but im not sure that contributed to me forgetting.

So basically ive gone 10 years without hearing or speaking my native language. The only thing i can do is count to ten but when i listen to my cousins speaking german, it sounds like gibberish. It hurts cause i wanna re learn, since i still have a german passport but ik it will most likely take alot of effort and time.

Question:
Would it be easier for me to re-learn my native language compared to others? cause it honestly feels like ive never spoken it.",1623831068,AlmightyAyo,12
languagelearning,"I have a strong drive to learn ABOUT my TLs, but not so much to actually learn them.","I love linguistics. I love languages in general. I love languages so much, in fact, that I'm trying to learn 2; Spanish and French. They're both romance languages, a lot transfers. I recognise a lot of words and have the conjugations relatively down well. Learning them together, it's not hard. At least there's not much extra strain with studying both.

However, me, I'm VERY bad at actually doing my work. In school, I always ignore my homework and pass by making very high test &amp; exam grades and doing *some* classwork and homework. I've done it almost all of my life. I've virtually *never* studied except for very few small bits before tests, and in French class. I hate it, it's a terrible trait to have. I try to get rid of it, but trust me it's very hard, you have so much... opposite of work ethic towards this stuff. Doing academic work or studying drains me so much, I swear it just makes me mentally and physically tired after such a short amount of time. I can't figure it out. 

So knowing this... I'm not very good at learning French and Spanish. It's not because I'm learning both, no, if you take one away I will learn the other equally as slow. It's because the time I sink into it is... variable, not constant or consistent, and one other thing.

This is more with Spanish specifically, but it may apply to French too. I thoroughly enjoy learning a lot *about* the language, I'll spend so many hours learning the phonology, history, very similar/derivative languages and all about dialectal variation, about the people who speak it, what it was influenced by, etc... but when it comes to actually learning the language I kind of just flop. I just can't get myself to spend a lot of time on it. Partially because I don't think I have any extensive resources that I should be using, and partially because I don't know exactly what I should be learning at that point. And also because I'm lazy when it comes to doing any sort of ""academic"" sort of work or studying. Even when I do do it, a lot of my learning is spent on stuff that I find interesting but don't need, like insults and cursing and certain slang (mostly to be funny around my BF lol). I have the ""motivation"" to learn Spanish and French, but I don't have the ""motivation"" to actually do it, if that somehow makes sense. However, for some reason I DO have the motivation to learn the phonologies, histories, dialectal features, and general facts about many languages, and I can tell you a lot about a language when I'm not really good at it. I have the ability to pronounce words very well (especially in Spanish, minus that rolled r I've tried so hard to pronounce for so long but failed). I just don't see why it's so hard for me to get myself to actually learn it better.

Anyways that was basically my main post, but also this. I have an extreme desire to learn other languages as well, mostly harder, but at this point it's futile and I refuse to try until I actually accomplish learning my current TLs. The list is Arabic, Chinese, possibly Russian, Hebrew, and Hindustani. And then I want to also learn a lot of more ""insignificant"" languages. But with my ""struggles"", I doubt I can ever accomplish this, even going just for an A2 or B1 in every language. That does make me sad, but if I can change this then it seems feasible.

Another thing, any recommendations on how I can learn various alphabets/syllabaries? Namely Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, and Brahmic. I've already known Cyrillic since forever, 8 year old me found it easy. I like knowing the scripts, it's actually useful.",1623830615,DeviantLuna,11

languagelearning,Value of translating your own native language writing into your TL for practice?,"Hey everyone, I'm an A2ish Spanish student studying through a mix of textbook exercises, lots of listening, and a couple hours a week with an iTalki tutor. Today my tutor and I talked about how I ought to practice writing more to work out output and practice using grammar concepts, and she suggested I translate some of my articles into Spanish (I'm a reporter). I like this idea and started working through one tonight. For some reason it made the grammar feel more accessible than when I'm writing just off the top of my head, maybe because I could see the English sentence in front of me and break down its parts to translate more easily and confidently. 

I'm curious if anyone has done anything like this or has any thoughts on its value as a learning tool. I know in general we don't want to be translating in our heads, and I've noticed that when I'm speaking fluidly I'm NOT translating in my head (different story when I trip up on a conjugation...). But translating-in-head seems somewhat unavoidable for a beginning/low intermediate learner practicing their writing anyway, given the amount of time that passes between having a thought and putting it on paper?

languagelearning,Does Norwegian sound like Russian?,"hello!! :)
tldr; I am just wondering if anyone else hears this weird connection or (purely aural) similarities between the two languages, despite them not being historically/developmentally related (to my knowledge).
Can any linguists help me out here lol

(Context:) I am a native English speaker, am weakly/semi-fluent in Russian after learning in college (and now listen to a lot of Russian music), and have (newer/added) family in Norway (and grew up hearing bits and pieces). All of that is to explain that I am not a native speaker of either language, but my ears are quite familar with hearing both :] I do not speak Norwegian, though, and have yet to attempt learning it.


Before learning Russian (and therefore getting aquainted with the sound of it), Norwegian just sounded like what an English speaker would expect to me--Germanic + Scandinavian, lilted, kinda sweet tbh. After learning Russian, I would be on video calls with my family, get distracted, hear them speaking, and my brain would go, this sounds like Russian??? and then a few seconds later it would go away. I've been hearing these sort of similarities right when I hear Norwegian ever since. Just now I was listening to a song (new to me) where the artist sings in English, then sings in Norwegian at the end and in trying to identify it, I thought it was Russian at first with the words, 
""Nummer en: pust
Aldri, aldri hold pusten
Nummer to: pust langsomt
Og dypt
Nummer tre: ikke mist pusten
Nummer fire: om et problem oppstår, stopp og senk angsten med langsom, dyp pust""

I was trying to find explanations, and the only brainstorming I have is: 
These lyrics/this passage sounded like it could be Russian (to me) up until ""langsomt,"" with the sort of swallowed ng vowel... and as the vowels started to be more open/elongated. 
Is it the way that you hit/place the consonants in your mouth (e.g. in ""pust"" and ""aldri"")? A lot of languages have rolled/flipped r's, and r's are definitely less emphasized/shorter in Norwegian, so it's not just that. Is it the way that some words are constructed that sounds so similar; do the consonant combinations reflect Russian more than some other languages do? Plus they both use a good amount of palatization, but my family is from southern Norway where they don't  even really do that?? 
Or do the smaller letter pairings/chunks in Norwegian that line up with patterns in common Russian words (I am no linguist, I am sure there are better terminologies/ways to explain these things...)?

There is obviously a significant lilt with pitch accents for Norwegian that is not present in Russian, but I feel like there is still some similarity there? Am I crazy lol. In Russian, the length and quality of the vowel matters more, but the pitch direction of a phrase can change the meaning entirely, so pitch does still matter... In my personal experience with Russian, I feel like words consistently have specific ways in which they roll off the tongue--in that there are specific stresses/an emphasized vowel in each word that shape how the rest of the word as well. I know that it's not the same as a pitch-accent, but is there any connection between where pitch-accents are placed in Norwegian words and stresses are placed in Russian? They just sound so damn similar in my ear sometimes, I don't understand.


So yeah... I tried to do some research on these languages' linguistic histories, but every where I looked, I could not find any connections. Norwegian is a Germanic language and uses a variation of the Roman alphabet, while Russian is a Slavic language and uses the Cyrillic alphabet... They're both Indo-European, but many other languages are as well, that do not sound so eerily alike to me! I tried to see if there were historical reasonings that would facilitate any aural relationship between them, or a relationship with word construction/stress shapings, or vowel/consonant patterns (again, there are better terms for these that I don't know eek!)... but I couldn't find anything. 
There was a pigeon language between the two that developed, but that was after they were both pretty established. Does the geographical proximity have anything to do with it? You would think that if proximity did in fact have any affect, it would be more evident in their earlier developments or anywhere at all... Gahhhhh. 

I guess this connection is more phonological and less about historical development, but how does that make sense???? Bruh. Am I crazy.


*Also for less important context, Russian and English are the only two languages I speak, but I watch a good amount of ""foreign"" films/shows and listen to music in different languages often too (e.g. Spanish, East-Asian languages, Hindi, Arabic, French?)... so my ear is, ~somewhat~ attuned to listening to languages I either don't know at all, or know very select words from (I hope this doesn't sound annoying, I just want to clarify that these two languages aren't the only two I hear LOL)
And for clarities sake, I don't often listen to/hear German, Portuguese, the many languages throughout Africa (I am so sorry!!! I very critically need to expand on that and appreciate these languages/cultures better off-paper eekk), Baltic or Balkan, Middle-Eastern  languages other than Arabic, other Germanic like Danish, Dutch, and extant languages, or Oceanic/South-East Asian languages. 
Sooo there are many tongues I am not at all familiar with hearing that could/do carry similarities to Russian, and could attune my ear differently if I was.

languagelearning,"Unless you're very young, a study flow that revolves around immersion will not get your vocabulary anywhere anytime soon. Here's an alternative technique.","Hello everyone!

I've been learning Norwegian for the past year (I need it to get into university here in Norway) and a few days ago I got my results back. I got C1 on the oral examinations and an overall of B2 on the writing tests, though my performance in the 'argumentative text' sub-test was apparently at C1 level. I got to this point over the course of twelve months, approximately 850 hours of studying and a *lot* of trial-and-error.

I decided to write this post in the hopes of helping others and adding my own two cents to the (already numerous) other study technique posts, but mostly because there's one issue in the learning process that I feel is not talked about very much. Namely, the way most people seem to expand their vocabulary by simply 'absorbing' words. By this I mean that they'll encounter a new word, look it up, write it down somewhere and maybe go back to it once or twice in the same day, and then abandon it. They'll rely on encountering it in songs or newspapers for the memorization bit.

That does not work. Or well, it does, but it's painfully slow, and I feel that I developed something better (if more effort-heavy, alas) in my time studying.

According to some word-counting software, I have memorized just over 15,000 words. *Actually* memorized, not just written down. I can't recall about 10% of them on command, but I can recognize all of them. It's a bit difficult to say what level this corresponds to due to the frequent presence of varying word forms (run, ran, running, etc) but it's enough to read literature without struggling (I miss out on maybe one or two words or expressions per page).

All in all, this memorization process took 225-250 hours, which I think is significantly more efficient than the more passive alternative.

If you've never used anything similar, then I think you should give it a try.

Here's what it looks like:

\_\_\_\_\_

**1)** Find an unknown word or expression (in my example 'blottet for,' which means 'devoid of').

**2)** Type it into a word file with the following format (or similar):

&gt;**Blottet for**  
&gt;  
&gt;**(+)** En fotballkamp blottet for spenning.

The top part that is in bold is the root word or expression. What's the plus sign? That's the context sentence. You should have one context sentence for every definition the word or expression can have. In this case there's only one, but you could also have something like this (three definitions):

&gt;**Å avrunde**  
&gt;  
&gt;**(+)** Tennene til uhyret har blitt avrundet.  
&gt;  
&gt;**(+)** Skal vi avrunde møtet? Jeg er sulten.  
&gt;  
&gt;**(+)** Vi må avrunde verdien til nærmeste hundre.

One mistake I made was in not including the different verb/noun/etc forms, which in Norwegian vary according to plurality and gender as well as tense. If you end up replicating this technique/process, I would strongly suggest adding them in brackets after the root word. E.g for 'avrunde,' which is a verb:

&gt;**Å avrunde (avrundet, har avrundet, avrund)**  
&gt;  
&gt;**(+)** Tennene til uhyret har blitt avrundet.  
&gt;  
&gt;**(+)** Skal vi avrunde møtet? Jeg er sulten.  
&gt;  
&gt;**(+)** Vi må avrunde verdien til nærmeste hundre.

Later on, I started adding in expressions that exemplified grammar rules I struggled with, or that I simply liked because they used abstract words in new ways. I wrote these like this:

&gt;***De betraktet meg som en stykke kjøtt som skulle tilberedes for en tallerken***

Note: The vocabulary files do not have translations. I found that to work best for me, but it might vary with other people.

**3)** Continue to add words and expressions (along with their corresponding context sentences) to the vocabulary file until you hit a specified limit. Then print it out. Personally, I waited until I had three pages of double-columned content in the file before sending it off to the printer, but my schedule was pretty dense and I was making one or two of these things every week. Find what works best for you. Let's imagine the file is one page long for this example.

**4)** You now have a physical copy of your vocabulary file. At this point, you're ideally a little familiar with its contents. The fact that you typed out the context sentences and looked up definitions while making the file, etc, means most of it will be relatively fresh on your mind. But it's unlikely that you'll be able to recall everything. This is where the part where the actual memorization begins.

**-** Take a look at the first root word/expression. Read it. Say it out loud a couple of times. Do the same things for its context sentence and definition. Then take a sheet of lined paper and write down the root on the far left hand side. Write the translation on the far right hand side. Next word!

**-** When you're done with the next word, or every two words, or every three or four or ten words, depending on what you discover to be most efficient, go back to the beginning of the list of root words you wrote on the lined paper and go through them. Recall their definitions. Can't? Don't look at the translation you wrote. *Look at the context sentence*. Repeat it out loud a few more times. Does it trigger your memory? Verify with the translation you wrote down. Continue moving down the list.

**-** When you've finished the printed-out page, fold up the sheet of line paper and carry it around for the rest of your day, periodically taking it back out and going through it (around a half-dozen times total).

This is the first stage.

**5)** Then there is what I called cycles:

Making those first passes with the lined paper is not enough. You need to revisit the vocabulary files, ideally no less often than once a week, and go through them again. These are the cycles. If there are words you have forgotten when you return to the vocabulary file, make another list on another sheet of lined paper. It'll probably end up being only a third as long. The third week, you'll likely only have two or three words. By the fourth or fifth you should have memorized everything (mind you, this is mostly recognition. You need to write that journal or practice speaking in order to improve your spontaneous recall at a faster rate).

By the end of my twelve months I had over forty, three-page vocabulary files and was reviewing eight per day, but I worked multiple hours every day and didn't have a problem with allocating an hour and a half to pure vocabulary. If you're just starting out with a language, your cycles will consists of far fewer files, and if you don't have a deadline or aren't too concerned with maintaining *everything* at perfect recall rates, then you can phase out old files that you're comfortable with. Assuming you go through enough cycles with them, they will decay very little.

\_\_\_\_\_

Looking back on this, it sounds more complicated than it is. Once you develop a flow, you move along pretty quickly. Reviewing the printed out files also takes less time than you might think, especially if you stop reading the context sentences. They're the first thing that get imprinted into your memory, and you stop needing them after the first week.

Anyways, I hope this will be of help. I'm not saying everyone should use this technique, but if all you're doing is writing down words once and flipping through your notebook every now and then, you'll probably have more luck with the above, or a variation of it.

8/10 would recommend (-2 points for being rather demanding effort-wise ;-;)

\_\_\_\_\_

Some additional points of advice, observations, etc, include...

**1) Write that journal**. This gets repeated a lot but it's difficult to stress its importance. It even helps your oral skills since it contributes towards how quickly you can shuffle around words and expressions in your head. You end up wording yourself better overall.

**2) Reading complex material** where you don't understand at least 75% of the text is often not as effective as reading a simpler text where you understand 90-95% of everything (unless you're specifically trying to pick out as many new words as possible). I personally only got into reading blogs, forums and literature in the final four or so months.

**4) Narrating what you're doing** and to what end is a pretty effective way of practicing your oral skills (e.g. ""well right now I'm heading for the fridge because I'd like a snack, though on second thought my friend said I was gaining weight the other day..."").

**5)** I've seen a lot of people say that 10,000 words is enough for C1/C2 level. That depends on whether they mean root words or including various forms for tenses, etc. If it's the former, then yes, if it's the latter, then I'd say probably only basic conversational fluency.

**6)** Duolingo is a fantastic resource to start out with, but not much more. When I started Norwegian I kept thinking that, surely, if I memorized all the content in the course, I'd have enough words and a good enough familiarity with the language to hit B2. Spoiler, it wasn't enough. And the Norwegian course is one of the biggest on the site. I would seriously advise against investing time in the unit leveling system. To the best of my knowledge, all the words used in all the levels are introduced in the first one. There are better ways to learn, and Duolingo is not as good as adapting to your needs as you are.

**7)** Switch your browser language to your target language. It does wonders.

**8)** Consider using the speed-up function on YouTube for videos that use simple and clear language but speak too slowly.",1623755556,-Earthlinger,29

Well, the opposite has happened to me (I stated ever since I started A2). I can't understand *that* much and I don't really know much vocabulary, but I can think in French. I can think, *without translating.* And it's really infuriating. Sometimes, I'll think in French (to practice) but then I realise that I don't know *this* word or *that* word (even though I feel as if I should).

languagelearning,Spanish activities for kids who are too young to read/write?,"
hi everyone! so a little background I'm currently working as a part-time Spanish nanny/playmate in Austria. The family I'm working with has two small boys (ages 5 and 3) the languages spoken at home are English and German. They recently moved from Colombia (the dad was stationed there for a while) so the kids picked up some Spanish. The oldest understands it and can speak in broken sentences, the baby understands most of it but can only say certain words. I've been with them for close to 3 months now.

Now my job is to come by about two times a week for 2 hours and just spend time and play with them in Spanish, just so the kids keep up the language and pick some more up hopefully. It's not meant to have a formal class/teaching structure, it's more about socializing in the target language 

(probs important to add, as my job isn't really to be a formal teacher I don't have any formal language training, in fact, I'm just a Spanish heritage speaker)

As i said the kids don't really read or write yet so I'm having a hard time thinking of more activities to do with them, as many language games are pretty focused on reading/writing.

to make matters worse I was sick for about 3 weeks and was unable to see them when i came back I was SHOCKED by how quickly their Spanish had gone down, the oldest  still understands just fine but is now speaking a lot more English to me while the baby's comprehension has gone down quite a bit and is speaking much more german now (which is their father's native language)

languagelearning,"Has anyone been in the position where you know it is best to just quit a language, but shame and guilt holds you back? German will become a ""sunk cost fallacy"" if I continue, but I feel like I can't quit?","I double majored in German and International Relations as an undergraduate and my reason for choosing German was wanting to do my Master's there. I was about a B1.1 or maybe B1.2.after the end of my major, but I understood a lot more than I spoke. There wasn't much chance to speak in class.

I got the DAAD scholarship I wanted to get to do my Masters, and it came with a. with a 6 month language intensive course from the DAAD as part of my scholarship which I was excited about because I could really learn German then. 3 weeks after arriving in German and 8 days into the language course, everything went to shit with the pandemic. I had to make a very snap decision on what to do, and I chose to abandon my scholarship and go home. It was the right decision overall as New Zealand is doing very well with Covid, but in doing so, I basically walked away from my chance to learn through intensive study. 

I have forgotten so much German.

I found it hard to motivate myself learning from books without the goal of knowing I’d be studying in Germany. I looked into taking online classes, but they are very expensive because the New Zealand dollar is very weak against the Euro. A month long course costs several hundred dollars, a 55 minute private class with a tutor goes for about 40-50 Euros which is about $70-90 NZD. I can’t justify it, especially as I’d need a couple of classes a week. 

After a couple of months of being back home, it was clear this this pandemic was here to stay and it could be 2-3 years before I could restart my studies, especially because New Zealand is like Australia and basically decided to shut down the borders and try and eliminate it as much as possible, so I applied for MA programs here at home, and got a scholarship for one at an Australian University online. I’m 2/3 of the way in and have been offered a really good job to start next February. I’ll be moving to Australia for the job. 

I have no reason to continue German and I know it. 

My main motivation is gone now. I’m not going back to Germany (or Austria or Switzerland) other than maybe briefly for a holiday. I’d be stupid to walk away from a very good job in a post pandemic economy and I don’t have the motivation to do another Master’s degree (especially the thesis) that is ultimately the point of the scholarship. 

My main motivation now is that I feel pressured to learn because even though it wasn’t well taught, I did spend 3 years studying it at University and it is on my degree. I felt like a clown with a degree on my wall saying I can speak German when I can’t so took it down. I wish my University didn’t print majors on degrees, but they do. I’d have to go back down and start at a lower level too. 

It’s so expensive to learn, and I don’t think I’m motivated enough to spend that kind of money on learning. It is total sunk cost fallacy. I'd be throwing money at learning German simply because I feel guilt about majoring in it (and I have student loans for those classes) and now having basically nothing to show for it. I feel like I started this project and should finish it.

I think I also feel a lot of embarrassment that I studied it for so long and could barely speak it and feel like I have to fix that.

But.....it is a chore. There. I admitted it. German is a chore. And a chore that would be expensive if I continued it. 

And I enjoy learning Spanish more.

 During my degree, I took Spanish 101 as an elective in my last semester because it has a reputation as a “GPA booster” at my Uni. I enjoyed it a lot and the teachers actually had us speak more than reading out a line of Goethe during the class.

I found myself regretting not starting it earlier. A friend who studies Spanish had a thing where if I took 2 online trial classes in Spanish through a Colombian language school, she’d get 2 free classes. I tired it and enjoyed it and kept going. I take 5 hours a week for what one hour of German would cost me. I started as A1 in May 2020 and am already starting to learn B1.2 stuff and am conversational in a way I never was German. 

I like it so much more but feel like I have to see German through because ""that is what you majored in"" even though I feel like I've found the language I love with Spanish.

But despite all this, I struggle to let go of German because of the guilt and shame I feel over spending a lot of time and money on something not working out. Has anyone been there with their language learning?",1623662087,springtelepathy,60

languagelearning,the simplicity of (some) pop lyrics is a real confidence booster!,"Not really an amazing milestone by any means, but I was sitting down to brainstorm some stuff and I wanted some music on. I told Siri to ""play songs by Moya Mishel"" and just expected to have something on in the background. Boy, was I surprised when random words started jumping out at me left and right. I haven't even hit the 3-month mark with Russian yet.

Most of my language-learning life has been spent with Asian languages, where music is basically useless for learning because of the vocabulary, lack of tones, non-speechlike rhythm, or all of the above. That is to say, I don't expect to get any linguistic value out of songs; it's purely for the music.

(Portuguese was a bit of a different story because I got into it \[&gt;10 years ago\] *for* the music and I spent a few months singing along with bossa nova songs before I started learning the language and having any idea what I was actually singing. So, I'd heard a lot of the same words often enough that it wasn't a revelation anymore.)

But Russian doesn't have the issues I listed above. I'm also taking a completely different approach, with a lot of focus on input. (I also do a lot of conscious study but avoid ""skipping ahead"" where grammar is concerned.) I have no prior experience with any Slavic language, so the non-Latinate layer of vocabulary is completely unfamiliar to me.

languagelearning,I read my first book in traditional characters!,"So, in the 8+ years I've been studying Mandarin, I've pretty much exclusively studied simplified characters. I've practiced reading some traditional characters, but not enough to read them easily.  

So, I came across some pictures of this book called 《山教我的事》 Lessons from the Mountains by a Taiwanese illustrator named 沈恩民 Shen Enmin. It's essentially about how he had a bit of a midlife crisis and decided to get into mountain climbing. The book is full of drawings and I loved the art style, so I decided to try and buy it. Since it's a Taiwanese author it was only available in traditional characters, but I wanted the book so bad I decided to take the plunge.

It was a huge struggle at first. I had to keep stopping to look up characters I had never seen before, only to realize that I knew the simplified versions. It was a little disheartening at the beginning, because I kept thinking that it would be easier if I had just chosen to read a book written with simplified characters. The character that was the most frustrating at first was 塵 （simplified：尘） because it just looks so different from the simplified character. 

I also met some old enemies, and by that I mean characters that I have never been able to remember how to pronounce. Some examples would be 伐 fa2, 郊 jiao1 (I always think it's pronounced xiao for some reason), 衷 zhong1, and 绵 mian2. Because 伐 came up so often in this book (步伐 pace, step, or march), I think I've finally gotten its pronunciation seared into my memory.

I think it really helped that there was only 3 or so short paragraphs on each page, and I didn't have to wade through any large blocks of text. It was also fairly short: it's got less than 200 pages, and the drawings take up most of the pages. I noticed that the further into the book I got, the easier it was for me to recognize characters and I began reading a bit faster. I was also getting a little better at guessing which simplified characters lined up with the traditional characters I was seeing. 

I also started noticing some characters whose phonetic components got changed when simplified. Like 階 was simplified to 阶. Their phonetic components are 皆 jie1 and 介 jie4 respectively. Also 驚 and 惊; then 棲 and 栖. So it seems what happened when simplifying these characters is that they picked a phonetic component that had the same/similar pronunciation as the original one and also had less strokes so that it would be easier to write. I thought this was a cool thing to notice.

I'm really glad that I decided to buy this book and challenge myself like this. I ended up really liking the book, and I think the art is gorgeous too! Hopefully I can continue to improve my recognition of traditional characters over the coming years.

I'm curious: have any of you exclusively learned traditional characters then decided to read a book or some other written work in simplified characters? What was that experience like for you?",1623619779,lievemealone,14

I finished high school having a B1 level of proficiency in English. But that was not enough for me. I wanted to understand movies (e.g., The Godfather or Pulp Fiction), song lyrics (like those by Bob Dylan or The Beatles), and Podcasts (my favorite is The Joe Rogan Experience).

All the things that I loved and still love are in English. So that motivated me to study seriously and not stop until I could read or listen in English without problems.

The assessments that I did tell me that I now have a general level of C1 in English.

The problem is that these assessments only consider my understanding of spoken and written English, but not my ability to speak English.

I studied Web Development, and I want to work as a Freelancer, but to do so, I need to speak English fluently. That would allow me to better communicate with my clients and thus grow professionally.

languagelearning,"Deciding between learning Italian, German, Russian, Hindi, or Spanish, but can’t pick which one I want to learn and need advice (I read the Wiki.)","So summer is here and I wanted to take the time to get back into language learning. I loved learning languages in early-to-mid high school (albeit casually, filling out Duolingo trees, listening to foreign music, real casual stuff) but haven’t really focused on it for the past few years.

I want to get back into it and there are a few languages I’d be interested in learning, but I don’t know which one to pick. I’ll list each language and the reasons I have for wanting to learn them:

PART 1: Languages that wouldn’t be practical but I’m still interested in learning

Italian: 

Pro: This was the first language I ever tried to learn. I think it’s a beautiful language, from the vocab to just how it’s spoken. I sang classical music in high school so I learned a lot of songs in Italian, and I also listened to a lot of Italian music as well (mostly operatic/classical sounding singers like Bocelli, Pavarotti, and Il Volo). Also I love the food, I think Italy is a beautiful country and I’ve always wanted to visit (Not just Rome/Venice but also Sicily, Surrento, Naples, etc.

Con: Not much practical use in my personal life (no one to speak it with. I use to live in New Jersey where a few people could actually speak it but I now live in a part of the US where there are virtually no Italians). I’m planning on working in Supply Chain Management in the food and beverage business, and Italy’s main exports to the US are vehicles, textiles, and apparel so I don’t see myself using it for work either.

German:

Pro: Similar to Italian, it was one of the first languages I ever started learning and I really liked learning it. People stereotype it as a harsh language but I genuinely think German is a pretty language that sounds structured and eloquent. Like Italian I’ve also sung it in classical music and just loved how it sounds and how it felt to pronounce. When I studied it before, the pronunciation really clicked for me and I just loved speaking it in general. Of course I want to visit Germany one day too. I also am about 1/4 German so it would be cool to reconnect with my cultural roots. Germany is also a big business language in Europe so it might have a bit more practical use for my career than Italian would.

Con: With that being said however, I know lots German companies when conducting business with Americans just speak in English anyway, and that a lot of Germans are already damn good with English. And pretty much same reasons as Italian, no one to practice with and little practical use in my work unless I end up working in Germany.

Russian:

Pro: Again, very similar to the past two. I think Russian is a very cool sounding language that is really fun to speak and pronounce. I also love Russian Choral music and have always wanted to see the basso profundos/okativists live in one of the orthodox churches. I also love the Russian culture and sense of stoicism that seems present in the society, and want to delve into the literature by Tolstoy, Pushkin as well as Chekov’s work as a playwright.

Cons: Same as the last two. No one to speak it with, and since there are lots of tensions with the US and Russia I don’t see myself working or doing business there.

PART 2: Languages that are practical that I would be open to learning

Hindi:

Pro: At first read, this may seem inaccurate as learning Hindi in America wouldn’t seem practical, but I live in an area with a high Indian population. My university is only 30% white, with there being a sizeable Indian population of I think around 40%. Almost all of my friends are Indian and I’ve had a relationship with an Indian girl in the past. Because of this, I figured it would be great to learn Hindi since there are so many people who speak it around me and that I could speak it with, and I feel like it would mean a lot to my friends if I learned their native language. Also business-wise India does export a lot of products to the US in industries id be interested in working in internationally, so it could potentially be useful work wise.

Con: I’m going to be honest, I don’t have a strong personal passion for Hindi. I’m not really interested in it the same way I’m interested in the first three languages. It’d be primarily to connect more with my friends. I also will be a senior in college in which I might move for work so I would no longer be in a predominantly Indian environment anymore (although I do want to stay in touch with all of them). Maybe I haven’t really given Indian culture a shot yet, which is why I’ve been reading up on Indian history as well as media like Bollywood.

Spanish:

Pro: Would undoubtedly be the most practical for me to learn. I live in Texas where there is a high number of Spanish speakers. Working in Supply Chain Management would mean I’d have to go to factories and warehouses often where a lot of employees would be Spanish speaking. It would also be fun to travel to Mexico and other Central + South American Countries and be able to speak/understand people in almost any of them. I also am already familiar with Spanish since I took 4 years of it in high school up to Spanish 4. While I don’t have nearly as many Spanish speaking friends as I do Hindi speaking ones, I have a couple and itd be fun to speak with them.

Cons: Same as Hindi in the sense that I’m not as passionate about it as the first three languages. Also, having studied it in high school for four years, it doesn’t really feel “new”, “exciting”, or “different”, so to speak.

I know the general advice is to marry both your interest/passion as well as practical use when picking a language, but I feel like all the languages here are either one or the other, but not both. Any advice for which one I should pick?

TL;DR deciding between Italian, German, Russian, Hindi, and Spanish. I am more passionate about Italian, German, and Russian, but have no practical use for them. I have practical use for Hindi and Spanish, but I’m not as passionate about them as am the former 3 languages. What should I prioritize/pick?",1623598163,anon246016878,18
languagelearning,"Is it worth using Memrise, Anki, or other rote-memorisation apps?","Hi everyone,

I was using Memrise for a long time to learn languages until I recently decided to switch to Anki, a monumental task given the sheer amount of vocab that had accumulated on my Memrise courses, however since then I've sort of semi-stopped using both. This was partly because of exams and other commitments but now that I'm getting back into my language learning habits I'm mainly reading and watching videos in my target languages, and have kind of given up on grinding vocab.

I would like to ask, how many of you simply forego vocab grinding altogether? The extent to which I was focusing on vocab was definitely excessive but both Memrise and Anki kind of force you to keep revising vocab, even though I'm now reaching the stage where I have to review more vocab than I can in a day, so I'm wondering if people here have success foregoing these apps altogether, and if so, what alternatives there are to learning vocab?

I am still somewhat attached to the idea of continuing with vocab grinding, seeing how successful it proved when learning German, but now I'm looking to mix up my language-learning strategy a bit and would like to here other people's opinions and experiences.

languagelearning,Where to practice languages actively (i.e not passive immersion) at a higher level? (Copypaste from my post on r/italianlearning since here there might be experienced learners with useful tips too),"So, I've been learning Italian for around 1.5 years now, and I'm fairly confident I'm a B2 speaker. I can follow most of the material I come across. I even can listen to politically themed podcasts targeted at native speakers, even if every so often a little detail slips through, I understand like 95%.

The problem is not my passive comprehension. It is extremely easy to find material for A1 or C1 when it comes to that. My problem is places to practice active writing and speaking. I've been speaking and writing with an italian friend daily. My Italian has improved a lot due to it. My fear is that I will not be able to advance further than where I am now, since our conversations are mostly about the same topics: Ancient Greek, Latin, how our days were, college struggles, et cetera.

I was wondering if you have any idea of a place for natives (I'd rather not immerse myself around learners lest I take over their mistakes or they reinforce my mistakes), that are about a wide area of topics, preferably advanced. The same goes for speaking. I use discord primarily for such purposes, since it has both voice and written communicative methods, and it's more fast phased than reddit.

languagelearning,Good voice recorders for language training?,"I'm looking for a digital voice recorder to train my pronunciation. Not a software recorder but hardware like reporters or doctors use.

What I'd like to have:

- hold a button to record, press another button to replay the last recorded
- good integrated speakers (not only headphones, real speakers)  
- nice would be a temporary mode where it deletes the recorded audio as soon as I record the next one, so I don't have to clear the storage myself all the time  
- AAA batteries would be nice so it won't be trash because of a dead proprietary battery after a few years

Hello guys, 

A month ago I published ""Simple Dictionary"", an offline English dictionary which is simple to use and has a beautiful UI, on the Google play store. I've got many suggestions and feedback from posting about it on reddit and I've added many features and improvements to the app since then. 

I have been focusing on how the app can be useful to keep track of the words one discovers while reading and also to help in adding them to the vocabulary. So I'm happy to introduce the flash cards feature on the new 1.2 version of the Simple dictionary app. Simple flashcards are generated from the starred words and meanings automatically making it very convenient.

languagelearning,Teaching my Italian mother English by speaking it with her 24/7,"I would love to do this experiment with her, I'm planning to speak in English most of the time (if I see that she's struggling to understand, is just tired or if we have to speak about important stuff I'll of course speak Italian to avoid eventual misunderstandings and not make this tedious for her), starting slow, with a lot of visual aids and resorting back to Italian if needed and some Duolingo everyday so that she can get accustomed to the basic grammar rules and sentence structure. 

This way she would get every day some time of exposure to comprehensible input and since she watches a lot of TV series and movies at some point she could watch them in English with subtitles.

She studied English at school 30 years ago and she can understand about 15-20% of what she reads (not sure about this, could be higher) and is able to guess at least what a text is talking about. 

Do you think in, for example, 6 months her comprehension and speaking (when she feels ready to do it in English) could improve in a way that would be considered worth it?

I would be happy to hear your suggestions!

languagelearning,Staying Motivated at Higher Levels?,"So I've recently rediscovered my love for language learning--in new languages. (Italian and Ukrainian.)

I had learned German and Slovenian pretty religiously for about a year and a half at one point, and while my German is definitely better than my Slovenian, both are far along enough that I can read articles and watch some shows with only a few words being new/foreign. (Though listening to Slovenian is tough. Everyone talks so fast. And talks over each other. Lmao.)

But I can't find the motivation to keep going with them because it feels like such a scrounge to find materials at my level in each. Still, I know I could improve more, but I feel like just finding the right materials takes half my learning time :/

Italian and Ukrainian are fun and ones I can make a lot of use of Duolingo and grammar books for since it's new. But God knows I'll hit a wall with them one day too.

languagelearning,Learning a language that I haven't been able to take the time to study + have no connection to VS learning a language that I'm interested in + have easy access to?," First of all, I have a lot of deadlines and commitments right now and can't take much time on languages, so if I'm going to resume my language studies it won't be for about 3 months. I'm just posting because I feel guilty for not being able to commit to either language and I want some peace of mind. I'm going to compare the languages as best I can and would appreciate your advice.

Spanish

Studying and progress: I've been studying it on and off, mostly by myself. (I say mostly because my university teaches Spanish in Japanese, and it wasn't for me. All of the studying I've done on my own has been in English.) I've been studying 30 minutes a day, and while I can understand some easier/repeated words, such as YouTube comments and online games, I find it very difficult to hear spoken words.  

Motivation: The reasons I wanted to study were  1) it's the second most spoken language 2) I thought it would be relatively easy since it has some similarities with English 3) I thought it was cool 4) I liked some singers who spoke Spanish and wanted to understand what they were saying in interviews without needing subtitles. But right now, I only feel motivated because it would be cool to understand Spanish and it would be nice to say I can speak Spanish in job interviews.

Culture: I lost interest in Spanish-speaking singers, and only like one Spanish band, but they don't speak English so I only listen to the music. I don't have Spanish-speaking friends and have no access to Spanish culture in my offline life. 

Korean

Studying and progress: I studied hangul for like 20 minutes or so a year ago and can still read it despite not formally studying it.  While I find it hard to differentiate between certain hangul, I have no problem comprehending them in words, even if I don't understand what they mean. (I'd recognize the word the second/third time I hear it, and I'd assume what it means and look it up. I'm correct most of the time.)

Motivation: Honestly, I'm not that motivated to study Korean. Lots of people can speak it in my country so it wouldn't really differentiate me from other candidates in job interviews, and I know this sounds bad but I wouldn't learn as many new ideas/meeting new people as I would be if I could speak Spanish.

Culture: I'm more familiar with Korean culture than with Spanish culture because of webtoons (I read them in Japanese, and I know they're too good to be true, but it's still better than nothing). I like a Korean band, and I've clicked on enough Instagram suggestions that there are always a few clips of them speaking Korean on my suggestions feed, and a lot of my friends are Kpop/Kdrama fans so they make me watch their content. My university has a high Korean population and I have some Korean friends. I live close to Koreatown and I use Korean products so I have lots of access to Korean culture in my irl life.

 My heart is telling me I should continue studying Spanish because I've always wanted to speak it but my brain is telling me to study Korean because it's going to be much easier and I'm lost.",1623509488,Iikeaflowingwind,10

languagelearning,Will improving input inevitably help with output for a language?,"I've been learning Spanish for approximately 5 months now, with some small background in it when I was in middle / high school over a decade ago. I'm noticing that my input has improved a lot; I can read texts and understand things fairly well (aside from complicated, unknown words here and there) and I'm starting to pick up on listening too. As far as output is concerned, I can write fairly well but speaking is where I see the slowest progress. If I want to say something I need to pause and gather the correct words / tenses before making a sound. I know that this will improve over the time by speaking more; however my opportunities for speaking are somewhat limited. 

I'm fortunate to have a friend who is fluent in Spanish and English that I can talk to, however he lives far away from me and I really only get to see / talk to him about once every two weeks due to our busy schedules. Other than that I have been using HelloTalk which I think has been the biggest thing assisting in output; however that is limited too because communication on it is more ""walkie talkie"" styled with random exchanges of audio clips rather than a proper conversation.

My question is; will continuing to read / listen to Spanish a lot each day, while taking advantage of these occasional opportunities to speak in Spanish, ultimately assist in being able to produce more speech in the long run? Or is listening / reading really only exclusive to the input side of fluency? Furthermore, will writing more help me with speaking or is it too different to really make an impact?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been learning German for 2 weeks now. Here's my daily routine:

&amp;#x200B;

30-60 new words from Memrise's German course. Its not as much as it sounds. Memrise counts any variation of a word separately, as well as phrases that include already learned words, and since English is a Germanic language there's a lot of cognates.

&amp;#x200B;

2 lessons of Nicos Weg - quick and easy. Though I wish there were something ""meatier"" like French in Action or Destinos!

&amp;#x200B;

1 episode of Dark w/German audio &amp; English subs. I don't count this as my active learning, but its exposure and I find myself recognising known words/phrases when I hear them.

&amp;#x200B;

30mins-1hour background music. Again, just exposure. I have the same playlist on repeat, and find myself remembering snatches of lyrics even without paying conscious attention.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm adding as of today:

&amp;#x200B;

Practice Makes Perfect Complete German, \~2 exercises/day. I don't learn well from textbooks, but find they're useful for practice/consolidation/review exercises.

&amp;#x200B;

Comprehensible Input videos on Youtube, 30mins/day. Unfortunately, not much available on this for German so I'm making the best of what I can find. I'm so envious of people who can use resources like Dreaming Spanish!

&amp;#x200B;

And lastly, I have a couple of resources I'm not sure when to start:

&amp;#x200B;

Graded Readers &amp; accompanying audiobooks. I'm not sure if I should start now, or if I'd get more out of them when I've got a more solid base in the language first.

&amp;#x200B;

Speakly. I have a lifetime subscription, but its not a very absolute beginner friendly app, so I'm waiting a little while before giving it another go.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I can't spend much on a language tutor, so I'm waiting til I'm a little further along in my studies. Hopefully we'll be able to iron out my issues with a few lessons, and then I'll be ready for language exchanges.",1623496323,Apprehensive-Mind532,19
languagelearning,Speaking a language in front of people who don't understand it,"I read a recent AITA post (https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/nxne6n/aita_for_refusing_to_speak_english_at_home_just/) where the overwhelming consensus seems to be that it is rude to speak a language that not everyone can understand in a group setting. I've seen similar posts with the same conclusion previously and it has always surprised me and made me wonder if it's rude just from an American perspective or generally seen as rude and disrespectful.

I am a Swedish speaking Finn married to an American and never even thought about the possibility of this being rude because it was so common during the time I grew up. My parents would speak Finnish, English or German in front of me even though I did not understand very much of either of those languages at that point. As I grew up, there have been many times in group settings where people will switch between languages even though not everyone in the group understands all of the languages. It just seemed completely natural and not at all rude to me, but maybe that is just because I grew up in a more unusual setting where speaking multiple languages was the norm.

Now that I have children, I have always spoken Swedish with them and English with my husband regardless of who else is in the room. Typically, everyone else that we are around will at least understand Swedish, English, and Finnish to at least some degree, so it's been more or less expected that nobody would feel left out and would understand most or all of what was being said. 

When I first met my husband, he obviously didn't understand any Swedish, but he made an effort to learn and had no problem with people speaking Swedish in front of him. A few years ago, he took and passed a B1 exam that he needed for his citizenship application, but his listening comprehension must be much higher at this point because he understands pretty much everything that is being said around him. He also doesn't mind people speaking Finnish around him even though his understanding of this language is still pretty basic). When my father-in-law visits, he will join in on the Swedish conversations even though he doesn't speak the language because he easily picks up new sounds and words from context (probably due to being a bilingual English-Spanish speaker who also speaks at least French, possibly more languages). Most of what is being said around him will be in English anyway, it's just when I directly address the children only that I use Swedish.

Overall nobody around me has ever expressed being uncomfortable with what language has been spoken even if they didn't understand much of it and instead people have in general been positive and interested and used is as an opportunity to practice. Maybe I have just been oblivious to how rude I have been and actually made people uncomfortable even though nobody has said anything? Is it generally considered rude to speak another language in front of people who don't understand it and I should switch to speaking only one language in a group setting (which in my case would most likely mean speaking English only in a group setting also in Europe because that's the one language everyone in a typical group that I am interacting with will be most likely to understand).",1623495513,BlueDolphinFairy,55

languagelearning,Method to transition faster from passive abilities to active abilities?,"Hi fellow language learners. 

I also like to study new languages, though I always try to complete one language before I go to the next. Completion for me is the C2 level, or in others words, a stage in which I can discuss any topic on a formal level without spending processing resources on the language, i.e. without thinking about how to express myself, let alone being limited by it.

A method that works for me is to just read a lot. Starting from easier books and going to harder, older books over time while actively learning the yet unknown vocab that appears. The problem is, that then your passive abilities (reading and listening) are very significantly better than your active abilities (speaking and writing). Ideally, I would like for them to be really close. 

Hence I was wondering: do you have any methods or small habits, to faster include passive knowledge in active abilities? Obviously I could just practice writing and speaking separately, but for that one needs another person. I'm talking about methods/habits I can do by myself.

  
An idea I could think of would be to summarize every just read page verbally in a few phrases after having read it and letting that become a habit. What do you think, would that work?

languagelearning,Language dilemma and choosing an approachable Indo-Iranian language,"Hello! I may need some external perspectives on a dilemma I've had a for a while. Due to having loads of free time, I can seriously get back to language learning. The problem is choosing which languages to focus on and I'm having a hard time regarding my choice of an Indo-Iranian language. 

Before I get started, here's some info about me: I have a lot of experience learning languages but only Indo-European (Germanic, Romance, Balto-Slavic) and Uralic ones. I've never learned any Indo-Iranian language before and I know only some general basics about them. Now, to my dilemma. I'm very interested in...

**Sanskrit**. For many reasons and I really have no excuse to skip that one but due to it being a classical language and quite different, I'm thinking about studying a modern related language beforehand, but I have no clue which one is the closest to Sanskrit. Any idea?

**Bengali**. I want to read Bengali literature, I love how the writing system looks, I heard it might be quite helpful in understanding some other North Indian languages, and its grammar seems to be easy to me (due to it being genderless, for instance, and I prefer such languages). However, I'm very scared of not finding enough resources and opportunities to practice. 

**Persian**. I want to read classical Persian literature, I may need it for a personal project, I'm fascinated by the Persian world, the language is apparently very approachable to a foreigner. However, the script creeps me out, and just like with Bengali, I'm afraid of not finding enough online resources.

**Punjabi**. I'm fascinated by it, I'm interested in Sikhism, it has loads of native speakers. Nonetheless, same issue with resources.

For some reason, I absolutely don't want to learn Hindi, so that rules out this common option.

Do you guys have any advice? Which of these languages (or perhaps another one of the same family) is the most approachable to a person who knows, amongst others, French, English, German, and Russian? And which one may help learn others? Thanks a lot!",1623445214,Waylos4,15

languagelearning,"A school of one that scales well. How to independently learn and teach a particular language, maybe within a particular community. How? The parrot skill 🐦️ [Work in progress]","How do I learn a language? How do I teach a language? I feel these are innate skills we humans have but somehow we're loosing with the advent of smartphones. We rely on apps, teachers, language exchange groups.. awesome, but none of that answers the question. The usual answer that everyone agrees on {read, take notes and create flashcards } doesn't cut it. There's more than *I understand this now I have to remember it.* Ironically, I've also built yet another language learning app. 

 

*Processing img ob3nmc1tsg471...*

**Anything? Nothing right? Your brain just says : this valid English, but then it's a dead end.** 

Here's a view of what's happening till you get to that point

 

*Processing img m7c0c3l5tg471...*

Some of these subroutines have their own dedicated brain regions. It makes sense to target them individually. I wake up everyday and I still cannot understand how even here on /r/languagelearning we don't have a clean answer for phonetics/phonology. It is clearly the basis of all language acquisition for but what do we have? IPA? **the** =/= **ze**, **عدس** not **adas**.. how do you learn pronunciation? 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 9smroektmh471...*

1. Listen to a word/sentence .. or even a whole song
2. Listen again with a lower volume while shadowing (repeating what you hear)
3. Record what you heard. 
4. Listen to your recording. Ask yourself, is that what I really heard? Record again 

.. rinse and repeat 🐦️ The ultimate test, can you rap in your target language 🙃️ Here's a video of this part of the app. [Video on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/561957979) 

*Processing video qa7uhp6axo471...*

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 7ouujmx40j471...*

For some, it might be possible to just learn pronunciation and be on your way. The rest of the work is not really new, just trying to make easier for your *school of one* to ask for help, by asking as little as possible. I tried to blur the lines between learners and contributors.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img pbx96ml11n471...*

After pronunciation, it's just various forms of input, whatever you can find. **One rule: no translation.** Translation messes up your learning path. Comprehension to be more precise. You must give your brain a chance to go through the 5 subroutines in the target language, don't just skip to comprehension. You *consume* the content and create flashcards for any words you don't know. The app preserves the context to use in the flashcards. I'm still not sure know what to put in the flashcards, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. So for now, not sure how to stick to the no translation rule.

Memory: a memory is supported by many contexts. The more contexts, exposures, for the same memory, the stronger it is. Flashcards are context tests, or reminders, to strengthen your memory. Anki is the gold standard here. The problem with Anki is it's not easy to get help correcting your cards. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img hl96lvmx5n471...*

So far, this is what works and what doesn't in the app:

1. Works: pronunciation part. Could use better graphics indicating voice placement
2. Partial: Importing bulk content, only works via command line, not through the app
3. Works: subtitle tracks music so you can read along.
4. Buggy: subtitle editor/creator
5. Works: stats. How much time you spent doing 
6. Partial: people in your group can correct your flashcard, but spaced repetition still not implemented.
7. **Public release blocker:** App is not released because the app is a privacy nightmare right now. Still connected to a central database, no way to self host. Going down this path, I'll have to get into moderation and group membership and all that jazz. Just no. Help me get this to a public beta. The app is written in Flutter, so I can publish to many many platforms. I plan the app will be free on Android but paid for iOS (similar to Anki). I'm still not sure about licensing. I think it should be opensourced but I have a 1000 questions. I've never done anything like this before so it's all a bit overwhelming.

If you made it this far and you think this work is work should continue, please support me. Crypto only for now. Paypal, Stripe, etc.. won't work here. Also, banks are bankrupt and ...  too long of story is. All just part of living in Lebanon.

languagelearning,Guide on how to write a journal,"This is a guide on how to improve drastically by writing everyday, remember that I’m not an expert by any means, I'm a normal student just like you, do things slowly and not rushing anything, learning languages can be tedious sometimes, and even more writing. I’m doing this because two months ago, I started recommending people to write in their TL, and a lot of people in r/languagelearning and r/Korean started to have doubts and ask questions about the subject. As I said, I'm not an expert and I’m talking from my experience, but I will be glad to help people if I can!

When it comes to language learning, there are several methods on how to approach your goals, whether it is having simple conversations or achieving fluency. People developed techniques like S.R.S(Spaced repetition system) in order to memorize more words efficiently. What I'm going to talk about is not really a technique. If there is something I want you to get from this, is that language learning is like math, if you don't use it nor practice it constantly, you won't improve.

**Why should you start journaling in your target language?**

I know a lot of people that learn languages with just an app or a textbook, but they don’t use the language.Journaling is a way of using the language constantly where you can review and learn vocab, Use this as a complement to your main resources.

First, you need a cheap simple notebook and a pen. Why not just use the computer? Well, basically when you write the word by yourself, it will stay in your brain for a longer time than just typing it. Why not use a cool expensive notebook with one hundred different colors? It basically distracts you from the main objective, making mistakes, if you have an expensive nb, that feeling of wasting money will be there. However you can use different colors for the words that you learn. Remember that there is not only one way of doing things.

Actually writing

Everything should be written in your TL and don’t focus on the grammar if your objective is improving your vocab. I highly recommend you to create an Anki deck and add the words that you have to look up and obviously didn’t know.

If you are a beginner in your TL, you should start writing super simple short sentences, for example: “I like apples”, “ I walked today”, “It's going to rain today”, etc. Don’t even bother trying to express complex ideas or doing paragraphs, focus on building a stronger vocab before going further.

When you feel comfortable writing simple short sentences from the vocab that you already know, You should start using connectors, like, therefore, and, from here to there, etc, Keep using the words that you know, don’t look up for words yet, Whenever you feel you have enough vocab, the fun starts.

If you dislike the next idea, you can jump to the **(\*)**

Use topics to organize your vocab learning in chunks, for example, write about animals for a whole week, try to learn related vocab to that topic and describe your ideas looking up words that you don’t know yet, Add them to your Anki deck, and use them the next time you write, Just because you are using those words, those will stay in your long term memory.

**What topics should you use?**

Actually you can use anything that interests and motivates you to keep going, are you a guitar fanatic? Write about your favorite guitarist, how hard some techniques are or just describe how cool guitars look to you, whatever it is, if you're interested then you're on the right track.

After the time lapse of writing about that subject, you have to write a little story about it, the point isn’t achieving perfection, it is using the language even if that means you are making atrocious mistakes. After some time doing this, you will run out of topics, and you can come back to a topic that you did before with more knowledge, learning more complex vocabulary.

Another idea is writing reviews of movies/books etc, there is no need for it to be long, go straight to the idea. This character did X and this other one did Y because of Z.

**(\*)**

You can start by doing what you probably expected from a journal: writing about your day. This works because we all have lives and stories to tell, about that friend meeting or simply taking our dogs for a walk, maybe the trip you made to another country, that's up to you obviously. Don’t focus on making what you write entertaining, focus on the vocab you are using, look up the words that come to your mind but you don’t know yet. We all have a certain set of words we use on a daily basis, try to add the words that you use in your NL to your TL.

And you will be thinking by now “why would I want to focus on creating output?I want to understand anime!!!!!”Well, have you ever felt that you didn’t understood what you had read or listened, but then you look it up again and you knew every single word, that's because you don’t have enough experience using the language, watching TV shows is totally valid too, but if you are planning to learn a language that isn’t that popular, you will probably run out of content to watch super fast. That happened to me in dutch. Finally have fun with it, there is no need to write a full essay every day, a few phrases will do just fine if you are a beginner.  o/",1623439057,loscaballosvuelan,0

I've been studying English for all my life and finally reached a B2/C1 level (I know, after all these years I should have a higher level, but better than nothing). The problems are two:

1)I don't know how to improve my level, if I just read, listen or watch a movie, I feel like I'm """"wasting"""" my time and not improving, but I also get bored learning vocabulary words through flashcards. How do you improve in a language after reaching this point?

2)Since I reached an intermediate level in English, I want to start learning another language, probably Spanish or German. Yet, I cannot replicate the process of learning English, since it has been soooo long that I completely forgot what I did other than living the language through Youtube and books. I'm watching all the possible videos I can find on language learning and I still don't have a fixed system that allows me to have a habit to follow everyday, for every language. (For example: One day I decide to do flashcards, but then I get bored or find out they are a waste of time, and the next day I do the Goldlist method, but then find out that is not as good as flashcards, etc. etc.).

languagelearning,The Internet has made me realise that I'm nowhere near fluency in English and everyone else here seems to speak English better than me.,"I know the title seems like a rant, but just as the flair says, I'm expecting some discussions. I think it's too weird to convert this into a DAE question, so it's just like this. Please skip directly to the end if you're not interested in any story.

And that was why I came up with this:  

Everyone around me believes that I have decent English skill, and I understand the reasons. I seldom consume popular stuff in our native language that my friends and other peers are interested in (please don't misunderstand me, I don't consider this as a completely positive thing I should be proud of. It's just a matter of interest). In their eyes, all I do every day are watching British comedy shows, scrolling through anonymous websites (fortunately, no one I know uses Reddit) and reading English articles on strange topics (I often have really specific interests that change swiftly). I'm confident to say that I can understand 99% of these contents. Moreover, I've been studying English since the first grade if kindergarten is not considered. So it shouldn't be too bad, and I thought it wasn't too bad.

But the more time I've spent here, the more unconfident I am. No matter if someone started learning English from an early age, since middle school or as an adult, I can feel the naturalness and clarity of their language. But whenever looking at sentences I wrote, I can easily spot odd usages despite not being able to improve them. Even something posted by someone with B1 or B2 skills (this is not a deprecation. Here I just mean that 10+ years of study should bring it to a better level) would make me think that I'm not able to write any better than them. Though I'm not sure if it's just a doubt or inferiority complex or I'm actually not good at it, I've lost a bit of my confidence in English.

I just want to know if this kind of thought and feeling is common for non-native English speakers and how to find out if it's real.",1623418196,pistolarodante,43

languagelearning,Proposing a technique,"My main goal with language learning is to get to a conversational level. That is, to be able to understand basic texts, daily conversation, to understand most of whats going on in most media.

Ive been watching Indonesian TV on Youtube for a while (kompasTV/NetTV). Recently I got to 1000 known words on duolingo for Indonesian. The top portion of my duolingo tree is all gilded so i figure i know 500 words pretty well. I go to watch Indonesian TV like I do and I understand a word here. 3 words there. A large chunk of what is being said is fairly unintelligible, it would be hard to know always the spelling of what actually is being said or fully break everything into individual words in my mind.

So what do I do. The technique im proposing is this: you get Harry Potter PDF (in the language you're learning), you get Harry Potter audiobook (in the language you're learning). You read and listen to the audiobook at the same time. You get spelling, you get pronounciation, you get rapid speed, you get the flow of how the language sounds. You hopefully learn how to break up the language into little chunks of words you know the spelling of in your mind. It doesn't matter that it's a translation of an English book. I need how the sentences sound and how the words sound and how to visualise the spelling of a word as I hear it. I need to be able to listen to something and break it up into chunks of words in my mind and know the spelling of those words, I figure.

The point is not to stop and look up the translation of any word, ever. The point is to get familiar with the pronounciation and spelling of everything... I can learn vocabulary best through duolingo until duolingo caps out at about 2000 words. Or anki, or classes, whatever you do. But this method im proposing, you get the combination of audio memory and visual memory, very rapid pace of a book being read. Emotion in the voice of the audiobook reader in the inflection of how they read each word. Correct spelling of all the words. The flow of the language.

If I just listen to an audiobook without reading the PDF too... I cannot break up the words into separate correctly-spelled units in my mind. If i just read and dont listen along, I have no idea how to pronounce it the way a person who knows the language would pronounce. So this technique it needs both at the same time.

**Some downsides of this method:**

If you're still as new to the language as I am, once you start the audiobook playing, you can't really look away from the screen for even one moment. Because as soon as I look away I will lose my place. So I take multiple notes like ""page 7 of PDF - 7:55 of audiobook"". And this way I can start the audiobook playback from different locations, once I've lined it up with the pdf and then I can scroll through the PDF as I go.

The other main downside of this method is you need to really know the alphabet and how it is pronounced. So if you're an English-speaker and you're learning Italian, German, French, Spanish, any Nordic country, etc. this method is great. Any umlauts or diacritics are easy to guess if you already know english and you can easily follow along with the pronounciation as you read. But to do this method with Russian, Chinese, Japanese. You might need to first convert the PDF into the bastardized latin script first. OR LEARN back to front, inside out the pronounciation of that language first. Chinese might not work because they dont really have an alphabet. but Japanese Hiragana/katakana maybe you'll be fine if you first learn back to front how to pronounce it, same with Russian cyrillic if you learn how to pronounce it first. Or find some computer program that can e.g. convert every 'д' in the pdf into a 'd', every 'з' in the pdf into a 'z' so you can read along in the latin alphabet you already know. I dont know. I dont know how this method would work if you dont know the alphabet and how its pronounced. I can read cyrillic very poorly, so if i put the russian audiobook on 0.4 playback speed, i can just barely follow along as I read the russian PDF, but like I say as soon as I look away from the screen I lose my place since I cannot really read it too well yet.

**Variation**

A variation on this method which i contemplate is whether typing fragments of the audiobook while looking at the pdf is beneficial, maybe beneficial for memory retention because then you have visual, audio, and muscle/touch action combined into one 3-sense ...type.. memory point in the brain for each word (theorizing?). Maybe this is for a later stage. Typing certain parts as listening to the audiobook. Need to be a fast touch typer to do this. I think I would rather type into duolingo. and just keep this method as a combined reading + listening exercise for now, speaking for myself.",1623364123,Adept_Ad_8458,12

languagelearning,Today’s unconventional milestone: speaking with a telemarketer in my target language,"I’m not sure if others have had this experience, but since changing the language on my phone and computer to my target language (Spanish), but I’ve found that Spanish continues to pop up in tons of unexpected places. My wife kills me every time we order from DoorDash because the order updates are in Spanish. I get ads on Snapchat targeted toward Latino teens or young adults. I wouldn’t say it’s been an enormously helpful immersion tool, but it’s been a fun way of weaving Spanish into various areas of my life. 

Today I got a call from an out of state number that I didn’t recognize and when answered it, the woman on the other line knew my name and asked me (in English) if I spoke Spanish. I was caught off guard and when I paused, she repeated the question in Spanish and I said “um… sí…?”

She went on to explain (in Spanish) that she had a fabulous sale on television and mobile phone services that she wanted to offer me. 

I was so taken aback I almost started laughing. I apologized and thanked her for call but explained that I wasn’t interested at this time. She persisted, and I explained we already had services and repeated that we weren’t interested. I asked her to take me off her call list and wished her a good day, and she thanked me for being nice and wished me well.

languagelearning,How should I approach learning/studying new vocabulary?,"I am currently studying Korean. If I had to guess my level, I would put myself at just above lower intermediate. I'm loosely following a textbook to learn grammar and related vocabulary. I recently started putting more focus on listening practice (with podcasts) and reading practice (with a book of really short essays). I have also had several lessons with a teacher on iTalki for speaking practice. My goal is to improve my communication skills. I want to get better at having conversations with people.

With that background information in mind, my question is how should I approach new vocabulary? I started reading more so that I could increase my vocabulary. Here is my strategy so far. I read one paragraph a day. First, I just read the paragraph through without stopping. Second,  I read the paragraph again and highlight the words I know. Then, I read sentence by sentence to work out the meaning of the sentence and to see if I can guess the meaning of the unknown words or recognize more words that I know. Finally, I highlight the words out don't know and look up their meanings. At the end of each article, I'll quite a long list of new words, and I'm not entirely sure what to do with them.

I use Memrise to practice vocabulary. I wonder if it is most effective for me to take all those new words and add them to Memrise. Should I add all the new words? Should I add only the ones I think will be most useful? Between the reading practice and the listening practice, I can gather quite a long list, and I think I'm getting a little overwhelmed, so I'm curious about other people's strategies/approaches/methods.",1623360608,wherearetheturnips,1

languagelearning,Lacking Motivation for French,"Hello! High school student here. 

Two years ago, I was choosing a language class to learn in high school. TBH, I had no interest in learning any language, but most colleges I want to go to recommend a four-year commitment. My close friends had decided they would take French, thus I thought it would be a genius idea to ""tag-along"" (spoiler: it wasn't).

Two years later, I'm demotivated. I have zero connection to the language and I will likely never use it. At the same time, I've recently picked up a hobby in language learning, as something I like to do in my free time. I'm studying Mandarin and Japanese (mostly for fun), to which I have an actual connection. I don't mind studying French. I'm not that interested in the language, but it's too late to turn back now. My problem is that it's hard to stay motivated when your brain is constantly reminding you that you will most likely never use the language. But who knows, maybe French will open up new opportunities I never thought of (at least that's what I like to tell myself).

So I guess I'm just looking for tips to stay motivated, and maybe advice on how I can use the language (especially after high school, as I hate learning things I will never use, though that's a big portion of school eh)?

There's little information on reddit, and I don't want to listen to whatever is on Youtube or other media forums as I believe they are mostly paid sponsorships. Was hoping to get some input from anyone here who might have some experience in this area.


Said family member specifically request for the iFlytek Translator 3.0, which is currently priced at about $600 USD from where I live (including tax and all.) And also the Jarvisen Language translator without the camera translation (about $500 USD.) While I don't want to deprive him of a efficient and decent tool for his translation need. The price is definitely a factor, as other translator device go for $50 to $200 USD, with a lot more positive reviews on Amazon (likely due to the price range being more affordable and thus allowing more people to try them). And the other thing that got me concern is Jarvisen and iFlytek are basically from the same company, but somehow they manage to ramp up their price while they don't seem to have any unique features that set them apart from other devices. 


So my question is, does anyone have any experience with translator devices that work well for them? The individual who needs the translator is an elder so I'm looking for something easy to use/learn (hopefully with either SIM/ offline feature). If it was up to me, I believe a translation app on an Android/iPhone does the job.

languagelearning,Learning German,"Hi people,

Ermm.. well my parents have decided that we are moving to Germany in a few years (like... 2/3 years) and they told me and my sister to try and already get a hold of the German language. My mom is a German teacher, but she is very busy with two jobs (1 part time and 1 full time), so only on weekends she could teach us but there are also other things to do, so she can't really teach us much. And since i'd be going there in high-school (so the language level is gonna be kinda higher) and since it is summer ahead and i have nothing to do, i thought about asking for some methods/apps that are good for self-taught people. I don't know any German, like, at all so I'd need a method/app that is good for A1 level. Also I already am on the higher side of levels in English (B2) and my native language is Albanian if that matters or smth idk. sooo yeah thanks for even considering reading this and trying to help mee. bye",1623317575,sorrowu,7

So I am a Spanish native-speaker and I am currently learning French. I started ""studying"" like a month ago. I use quotation marks with studying because basically all I do is have lots of input and look up some of the words I don't understand. (I had actually studied French like 5 years ago, but I gave up on it. Now I can understand around 50% of spoken French and 80% written French, but I can't talk at all).
I have been getting super interested in Portuguese in the last couple weeks after I started discovering how wonderful Brazilian music is. I have never formally studied Portuguese, but since I can understand  a lot of it thanks to my Spanish I thought I could do the same I am doing with French rn.
However,  I am afraid that if I start studying Portuguese as well I would end up not learning anything since both languages are so similar and I am going to use basically the same method (99% input, 1% actual study).

languagelearning,Mass Immersion Approach and Anki: critical and negative opinions?,"Hi guys. 

I hope what I’m saying won’t be controversial, so I want to preface this by saying I don’t wish to invalidate any language learning method or spark any argument. Different things work for different people, and that’s ok.

I always see so many people praising Mass Immersion Approach (MIA) and in general the use of Anki, but as much as I have tried, I can never seem to make it work for me. Be the passive approach, the mindless memorisation or maybe just the thought of spending so much time cooped up in my room alone in front of a screen doing Anki, I really don’t feel like I am learning any real skill from it. I know many have managed to achieve incredibly high levels of fluency through it, and I am sure that it works for the majority of learners, but how come I have never seen anyone sharing my same experience or in general have a negative opinion about it? At times it seems like there is no other way to effectively learn a language to fluency.

languagelearning,I'd like some feedback from this community if this sounds like a good language learning method,"Some context first: I have been learning Spanish since January of this year though I have some background in it when I took classes for it in middle school / high school over a decade ago. I can read and write it fairly decently and can have basic conversations with people as long as the topic isn't complicated (I can talk about my work, the weather, my family, hobbies, etc. basic stuff). I'd say I am an advanced beginner at the most and I know I have barely scratched the surface.

I feel the next step is expanding in listening and conversational abilities. I currently am doing that by listening to lyrics in Spanish songs, listening to Spanish podcasts, watching Spanish movies / shows, and talking to Spanish speakers via the HelloTalk app. I use Duolingo as an additional tool to practice as well as learn new vocabulary. I know straight up memorization isn't the key to fluency; but taking the new words I have learned and making them meaningful enough to be able to use on an everyday basis is the key, which leads me to my overall question:

There are various words in Spanish that I don't have stored in my brain at the moment, such as random words like pillow (almohada), mirror (espejo), stairs (escaleras). Now they are common, everyday objects that I can easily name in English but wouldn't know them in Spanish at the moment. They are however, all similar in that they are everyday objects that I interact with everyday in my life. So with that being said, would a good learning method to engrain these words into my long term memory be something along the lines of focusing on approx 3-5x words per week and using them everyday as frequently as possible? For example, each day of the week I would use the words in various sentences such as ""me gusta mi almohada. Es muy cómoda. Mi almohada esta en mi cama. Mi almohada es de color blanco."" Then if I am talking to Spanish speakers and I am joking about how busy work is, I could say something like ""mis mejores amigos son mi cama y mi almohada."" By using the word repetitively each day in different sentence forms I feel that would help engrain it better so in the future if I were to talk to a Spanish speaker and mention the word ""pillow"" it would be readily accessible. I would do this with about 3-5 words per week.

I know I should start with tones and alphabet, but where do I go from there? And where I can find some grammar book/sites I can follow? What about vocab? Any videos?

Usually I use some random podcast app to play them, but I'd like to use Spotify as the interface is nicer, it's where my music is, and I can more easily manage which ones are currently downloaded to my phone.

Only issue is they just play like 30 minute songs. ie I can't just click back 10 seconds, it instead will restart the whole file. Also it won't remember my place in the file if I quit and come back later.

Several verb tenses in all Romance languages have become only literary or archaic, and many grammar-teaching posts only provide the present and imperfect subjunctive forms, so I am wondering: are Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian present (past) perfect and pluperfect subjunctive forms also rarely used today in modern speech, or is it just French?",1623198536,WingsOfReason,12

I know this method can be done the *wrong* way, but I think this is a good method for intermediate learners who still haven't quite made the leap into understanding normal adult TV shows or natives speaking in podcasts, etc. 

Pretty much, just put the subtitles on and stare at the middle of the screen. Watch their lips. Follow the voices and the words and, if you need the ""crutch"" to go back to, you can always glace down, get context, then go back to solely the voices in the target language.

Another fun idea is to read ahead, almost like a sing-along, and think of what the words they're just about to say should be.

languagelearning,What's this method called?,"Really sorry, I've pored through the wiki and Google and can't find the answer. I've been learning Welsh using Say Something In Welsh (SSIW), which consists of 30 minute audio files with the tutor saying something in English, you say it back in Welsh, and then the tutor and another speaker repeat the sentence back to you to check yourself. 

I've found this incredibly helpful for learning the ""glue"" of the language and getting to a conversationally competent level quite quickly, especially with the focus on high frequency words at the start and useful full sentences.

I think the closest resource I've found that fits the same formula for other languages is Pimsleur. However, the wiki echoes my feelings on this - it's a far, far slower than SSIW and to be honest I feel it focuses on less useful language, mainly things you might say as a tourist or on a business trip.

Does anyone know what this method is called so I can have a look around for alternatives that fit the bill? Specifically I'm looking to build on my German - I've got a better range of vocabulary in German than Welsh, but the important words that let me string a conversation together are missing.

I'm a native English speaker from Texas. I studied German for a year to get a high school requirement out of the way. While it was a lot of fun, and honestly made more sense than English did, I wasn't ""in love"" with it, and couldn't find anyone locally to speak/practice with, which made ""getting into it"" difficult. While I might return to it later, I would say I'd like to try another language than German in University. 

Generally, pronunciation is most challenging for me in the language learning process. Although sometimes feared, I didn't find the grammar for German to be that bad... What I learned is that in order to truly learn a language, you need immersion, and that was something I really didn't have.

I'm really considering all other languages. European languages (French, Italian, Russian, etc) and Asian Languages (Korean, Japanese, etc) seem interesting to me. I'm scared that learning an asian language might be too hard.

Does anyone have any advice on which language I should learn? 

My fellow mathematicians, engineers, and people who work in the sciences - Which languages are often most utilized? Which language would be best for job prospects? 

Native English Speakers who learned an asian language in college - How difficult was it? How did it go?!

languagelearning,How to improve my Italian past this point?,"So backstory: I've been learning Italian for around a year and 2 months, spending quite a bit of time daily on it (quarantine granted me more free time). My level is pretty good I think, probably a B2. My writing can be seen in my post history. I don't need a dictionary anymore to write those, although occasionally i use one to write down new words to add to my anki deck.

&amp;#x200B;

I also read all harry potter books and I regularly read RAI news, which helped me with my reading speed and precision significantly, I saw a great difference between la pietra  filosofale and i doni della morte (I believe in English the philosopher's stone and the deathly hallows?). They both also have been supplying me with a source of new vocabulary.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm kinda asking myself, how can I progress further? Most of my problem seems to be with vocabulary, as well as listening comprehension. I've never reached this high of a level in a language (not a brag or anything, my level is still far from perfect), so I'm a bit clueless on how to progress. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am already immersing myself, which should yield results, but I'm wondering if there's any tips &amp; tricks? Ways that are better than other ways? What's the best way to accumulate vocab? or is just mass immersion at this point sufficient?",1623085703,ConiglioCaro,5

I'm building a Language Community where you can find many people who are interested in exchanging languages.

Our club members host the free group sessions via zoom in their native languages so that other people can join them.

It is mostly conversational sessions where people can talk and meet people with same interest in language learning.

My concern is here, now i have got +260 members from +50 countries and we've had more than a 30 sessions in 9 different languages, but there always have been free-riders who only participate and never host the sessions back..

So I’ve devised a way by setting up a reward system; hosting once grants two participating tickets. It’s supposed to motivate hosts, resulting in wide variety of sessions for members. In this regard, I would like to hear how you think. Will it be so troublesome to host one-hour session of your language?

languagelearning,My year long journey with Macedonian or how to avoid the pitfalls I encountered,"I would like to share with you my first year of learning Macedonian, not because it is a success, but rather to share some mistakes I would like others to avoid. I don't intend to write a comprehensive guide as there are many ways of learning I didn't try, but just to give some tips based on personal experiences.

I started learning Macedonian for personal reasons as a native Germanic language speaker, that’s also fluent in English. I have experience with German, French, Spanish and Latin in high school but consider myself to really struggle with languages, and never picked up the above languages beyond the basics. I was not exactly ready for the challenge that a Slavic language would pose. However, I could read Cyrillic before I started. 

My current level is, personal estimate, around A2. I can have basic conversations in high-context situations (stores, taxis) and make small talk. When typing I can have basic conversations but along a wider range of topics. Reading level is similar but very slow, and listening remains the most difficult for me. I’m slowly feeling more confident in actually using the language nowadays and I have a good grasp on grammar, even if implementation of it is slow still.


**Things I did wrong:**

*Number one.* Trying out dozens of different half-baked methods. I started out learning verbatim sentences from Dutch-Macedonian from a tourist handbook I found. This proved extremely difficult due to the endless verb tenses, genders and declensions that Macedonian language has. For instance; there are 18 different definite articles. I figured out I really need a lot of grammar to figure out the basics. I tried some online courses that were all pretty messy. Finally I just bought a big grammar book for about 40 euros, which put me on the right track. In the end I also got an language teacher through iTalki so I could ask questions about the language’s terrifying grammar and I could finally move forward. The only good thing I did was constantly interacting with the language in some ways. I would recommend other people to figure out a well-rounded approach and stick with that and not be afraid to spend a little bit of money. After all, what is 40 euros for a year of learning?

*Number two.* Learning first Dutch-Macedonian and later English-Macedonian. In the end I started confusing all three languages unnecessarily. Just learn your target language from one single other language, or you will have difficulty translating things to one other language in your head.

*Number three.* Learning very well how to translate English to Macedonian, but not the other way around. Now I am in the strange position where it is easier for me to talk and write the language, than to actually understand it. 

**Things I did right:**

*Number one.* I interacted with the language pretty much every day since I started learning it, even with my messy methods I still got a decent feel for how sentences should sound mostly due to exposition.

*Number two.* When I started learning words with some context (short sentences, learn one example of all different declensions (yes for instance 68 different declensions of possessive nouns)) I really moved ahead quickly in understanding.

*Number three.* Trying to talk in casual settings. When drinking Macedonians usually find it quite entertaining that I tried to speak the language, and I actually improved a lot by just trying and failing a lot. Alcohol helps with language learning in that sense because you are more willing to just fail.

**Overall tips:**

*Number one.* Spend a bit of time and money on setting up a well-rounded method (listening, speaking, grammar, writing, vocabulary) and don’t be afraid to get a teacher to consult with, even if that’s relatively irregularly. Stick with your method and don’t switch all the time.

*Number two.* Learn the language only from one other language, don’t mix up learning from different languages because it will be difficult to translate things in your head.

*Number three.* Don’t just learn to write your target language, also learn to translate the target language to your own language. This of course is related to following a well-rounded approach. 

*Number four.* Everybody knows this one… just try and fail to speak. Alcohol helps. You’ll learn a lot, and it is even fun when you are with the right people.",1623069116,Flying_Rainbows,14

languagelearning,Is there any universal (generalized) rules to start with more efficient way to learn a language?,"I am speaking from an obvious English bias, but what I mean is if there was any algorithm that handles most of the syntax of a language?   


For instance, consider the following.

1. The five Ws (what, where, who, why, when) and H (how)
2. Articles (a,an,the)
3. Gendered Nouns (he/she/they)
4. Possesion &amp; Persons (I/me/mine/yours/theirs)
5. Tenses

  
To learn English, one could just permute all the rules from the above five ""axioms"" (a finite set) and then use them in conjunction with a large vocabulary of nouns/verbs and can seemingly become a good enough English speaker.

Hopefully, I won't get the annoying standard question, ""How long did it take you?""  Just look at the certs.  I'm on track: one level per year, as planned.  Not trying to break a speed record, which seems to be a thing.  Trying to crush every exam, to walk into the test center confident and ready to go.

FWIW, started learning French at age 61, took the B1 test at age 64.  I always chuckle at those posts, ""Is it too late for me to learn X?  I'm 24!""

I have not written up a long explanation of what I did to prepare, but it's nothing new, special, or unique.  It's all the standard stuff: Anki, iTalki lessons, watching TV, graded readers, listening to audiobooks, transcribing, etc.  

Anki is my main weapon.  I was up to 8,400 cards the day before the exam, 163,275 reviews, 871 days/row (2 years 4 months, 21 day streak), 530 hours.  Most of the cards I made by hand, one by one, with audio.  That takes a lot of time, but it's actually additional learning time.  I typically write my answers down with a fountain pen, so I get daily writing practice as well.  As time went on, I would write only the the difficult parts.  E.g., I stopped writing ""Je suis..."", etc., every time.

languagelearning,My 1st month with russian,"Hello everybody

It's been a month now since i started learning russian, i've actually been enjoying the journey because russian is a very beautiful language tbh and it's also challenging.

I decided to share with you my progress to keep myself motivated and also, this might motivate another person so why not.

I've been studying everyday and i take the days i am lazzy off but the day after i force myself to keep going because i don't want to lose whatever i accomplished, and also i didn't set a specific time spane to study in (i don't know if that makes sense) i just start something new and quickly review whatever i learned the day before and i get up as soon as i finish the course whether it'll take an hour or less but mostly it's just around 40 mins and less.

 My current level is A2, i learned 2 cases (accusative, prepositional) and we can i say i mastered them they weren't so hard to me. 

I do actually have a very big problem and it is vocabulary, my vocabulary is really small i don't even think that i know 100 words which is a problem that is making me not able to read small texts because I don't understand them, so i really need help with this problem.

Sorry if I took too long, i just wish that if you see any mistakes in my English you'd tell me i'd appreciate it.

Thank you everyone.",1623039081,FaresWael15,7

I find when I just put IPA on my Anki cards, without an accompanying French orthography, I both recall and perform the oral forms of the words and sentences better.

languagelearning,Going from reading and writing to Speaking,"So, I've been learning Russian for some time now, and mainly through reading and listening, as well as texting with people in the language. I have noticed that my reading comprehension is definitely getting better, I am able to recognize words and derive meaning through context, morphology, etc. etc. But because of a lack of speaking practice, its hard for me to recall words when I do try to speak. 

My question is this: has anybody else had difficulty actually starting to vocally communicate after a substantial time learning through reading? As in, you have a good vocabulary and a decent level of comprehension, but trying to piece together constructions according to grammar seems harder once you have a good number of them in your repertoire.

I know that they say speaking from day one is the best way, and it definitely too late for that. But its just something that I have been wondering about.",1623020212,polyglot2be,7
languagelearning,How far exactly would studying a language as part of my 4 year degree (w/ 3rd year spent abroad in target country) take me?,"I would first like to explain that I'm not doing a full-on language degree but rather studying a language is a component of my degree (I guess you can think of it like a minor?) where 1/4 of my total credits per year will be spent on learning a language. The program on the uni website advertises the degree to give us fluency in a language upon its completion but I highly doubt it lol. Now I was wondering this question cause it would really help me in deciding which language I'd like to choose between Japanese and Mandarin. 

Given the potential fields I'd like to work in after university (high finance or development banks e.g. world bank, ADB, etc), knowing Mandarin opens so many more opportunities and is considered as an additional attribute when applying to multilateral banks. But again, claiming to know the language when applying for jobs means full professional proficiency. If studying a language at university can greatly help me reach that level I would definitely pick Mandarin. If it however gets me nowhere near there and far more extensive training is actually required beyond my university degree, then I would probably just opt for Japanese where I could just learn it as a hobby (as I like manga and anime) and also get a chance to live in Japan during my 3rd year spent abroad (which is somewhere I would much rather prefer than mainland China).

As for my language background, my native is Indonesian and I think I can say that I'm completely fluent in English. I also actually studied Mandarin during elementary and middle school but stopped right before high school. Now that I've graduated HS, it seems like I've forgotten a WHOLE LOT after 3 years of not keeping it up so I only rmr the very basics as of rn.",1623017506,strafa27,8

1.) French
I’m taking French right now in high school (I’ll be a Junior this August) and I love my French class, but I don’t have much desire to learn French outside of it. France is beautiful, and I love the culture, but I can’t get into much French media like movies and music

2.) German
My grandmother on my biological dad’s side was German, and I think it would be cool to learn German just for that fact alone, plus being about 20-50% Eastern European, I thought it would help me feel more connected to my lineage. 

3.) Spanish 
Living in the US, Spanish is a big part of the culture here due to the large Hispanic population. Many of my friends are Hispanic and I often run into native Spanish speakers in public. I wanna learn Spanish since it would be very useful and it just sounds so dang beautiful, it’s such a soothing language on the ears. Plus, a lot the music slaps and I often rewatch some of my favorite movies and shows dubbed in the language just for the heck of it. 

4.) Russian
I LOVE Russian culture and history. I will spend hours watching videos on YouTube about the history of Russia/USSR and learning about the culture. I especially love NFKRZ’s videos and his comedic takes of Russian lifestyles. Plus it’s fun to swear in Russian lol

5.) Lastly, Japanese

It's an initiative to connect people from all over the world with isolated elderly people in order to reduce loneliness for the latter and also for French learners to practice their skills. It's also all free and all you need to give is your time and attention. 

It seems like such a wonderful resource and it honestly makes me wanna get back to learning French just to do it, haha. I'm currently learning Italian right now and really want to find something like this for it too! You do need to be at least at a B1 level to participate and there's also a long waiting list (it says that those at a B1 level minimum and younger than 35 will probably have to wait a year to get off the list) ever since someone posted about their experience and more people heard of its existence. Nevertheless, it's still worth to check out and see if you're up to it. I hope this is helpful to some of y'all! Bonne chance with your French journey! :)",1622943374,rylkim123,2

languagelearning,List of Japanese resources + some helping points,"Hi all, I put up a post last week about documenting my language learning journey monthly, this isn't an update post, rather just a huge list of all the resources i've found super useful in getting me out of the beginning stages. Here's my first post for anyone interested: [https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/np1jnw/documenting\_my\_entire\_language\_learning\_journey/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/np1jnw/documenting_my_entire_language_learning_journey/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

As we all know, getting good resources for learning can be a pain, which is why i made sure to compile as much as possible before i began learning, so i thought i'd help anyone else out because i know it sucks to be searching around for the right stuff.. Now you know longer need to! Just reference this post.

\*\*Beginner learning materials\*\*:

Memrise - An app good for learning new vocab that also uses the SRS system, i used this at the start to learn vocab and also Hiragana and Katakana. Not so good for learning anything else other than basic phrases and getting new vocab. I still however use it daily for the good points.

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSyd8tXJoEJKIXfrwkPdbA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSyd8tXJoEJKIXfrwkPdbA) Japanese ammo with Misa- A youtube channel that you can learn a lot from, this channel for sure has helped me learn a lot of grammar points (she has an entire playlist dedicated to grammar for beginners) As well as videos on slang, phrases and other things here and there. She explains things very well and is easy to follow, only downside is that all videos are in english so not good if you're doing immersion like i am, however i did find this channel super useful in my first few weeks.

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXo8kuCtqLjL1EH6m4FJJNA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXo8kuCtqLjL1EH6m4FJJNA) Comprehensible input Japanese - This channel is SUPER underrated. I'm sure some of you have seen the Stephen Krashen input hypothesis demonstration in which he drew a picture while speaking all in German? This channel is basically that... All videos are in japanese aided by drawings and it's super comprehensible. Please give this channel some support.

[https://www.punipunijapan.com/japanese-verb-types](https://www.punipunijapan.com/japanese-verb-types/) Puni Puni Japanese - Website with videos covering the absolute basics, i only used this a little but could be more useful for others out there.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Japanese content for immersing\*\*

There's no shortage of japanese content to watch and listen to, but here's some stuff that i've found useful and would like to share.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coYw-eVU0Ks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coYw-eVU0Ks) 24/7 News livestream - Literally just japanese news that's livestreamed 24/7, not much needs to be said about that, i put this on every single morning and evening as background noise for passive learning. Constantly hearing japanese is super important.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCX96BOqHh0&amp;list=PLMVzoFFwmG5B2QINW\_DySJXV\_0U4VnOv2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCX96BOqHh0&amp;list=PLMVzoFFwmG5B2QINW_DySJXV_0U4VnOv2) NHK easy news playlist - More news stuff, this time slowed down and also displaying furigana for kanji.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v6kW0Im40&amp;list=PLyJCUas37mqenV4\_EaZjeoV8DzAoKMYX4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6v6kW0Im40&amp;list=PLyJCUas37mqenV4_EaZjeoV8DzAoKMYX4) Sambon radio podcast - A playlist of podcast style videos with fairly simple and slow language.

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX1xppLvuj03ubLio8jslyA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX1xppLvuj03ubLio8jslyA) \- HikakinGames - Probably the most popular japanese gaming youtuber.

NETFLIX - Need i say more? Change your profile language setting and you've got a TON of japanese input you can watch and listen to.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Chrome extentions\*\*

[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/language-learning-with-ne/hoombieeljmmljlkjmnheibnpciblicm](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/language-learning-with-ne/hoombieeljmmljlkjmnheibnpciblicm)  Language learning with netflix - This extention is INCREDIBLE and i've been using it everday. It simply shows the translation of words sentences as you watch a show and allows you to save and favourite them too. This is amazing if you're doing sentence mining.

[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rikaikun/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rikaikun/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp) Rikaikun - This is super helpful if you're reading, hover over kanji and it shows you the translation for it there and then.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Other stuff\*\*

[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/215365929](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/215365929) RTK kanji deck - Probably the most complete anki deck out there for learning kanji, it's a grind but then again, learning kanji always will be, this just makes it a little easier.

[https://jisho.org/](https://jisho.org/) Online dictionary - probably the best one i've used so far. Type any word in english or japanese and this will have the translation as well as example sentences.

&amp;#x200B;

This list probably isn't super complete but it's all the resources i've found useful so far, If i find anymore worth noting i'll probably list it in my next monthly update. For anyone wanting to learn japanese i hope you find this useful. Other than that, good luck everyone! 頑張って!!",1622910527,Rtas00,4

languagelearning,What languages should I learn if I want to be able to converse with as many people as possible?,"I've thought about this, and wondered if searching for countries by increasing percentage of English speakers would be enough to answer the question. If you go by the list in Wikipedia, they will give you a number of countries with relatively low population with the exception of China, Brazil and Russia. Not only that, but their native languages seem to be more obscure and don't have many resources, e.g. Burmese which would make it tough to learn without immersion. 

If a country has a high number of people who speak English (e.g. Germany, Sweden), then surely it would be more efficient to forgo their native language and go for another country, which has a large enough population and won't have many people knowing English, thus actually giving you a need to learn their language (e.g. China). 

Or is it enough to go by population of countries?

languagelearning,"How effective would using Duolingo for 30, 40 minutes daily be for reaching A1?","The three main problems with Duolingo in my view are:

1. People spending 5 minutes on it daily, more as a chore and for a high score, than for learning
2. Lack of text stories for context and input, instead you get random different sentence examples, that often don't even make sense.
3. Limited content, once you reach A1 more or less, that's it.

The second problem can't be solved by using it longer per day and neither can the third if you don't use something additional, especially once you're done, but can the first problem be solved, ie can you learn more stuff if you do it for 30, 40 minutes a day and reach A1 faster?

languagelearning,I got to be part of all the language groups at the park today!,"I went with my kids and a friend to the park today, to meet up with some of the usual moms, nannies, and kids there. There was a little birthday celebration and lots of conversation. My friend speaks Dari and no English, so I was translating for her. One of the nannies wanted to talk to her more, but she spoke Spanish and no English. So I translated from Spanish to Farsi and back.

It’s so interesting to observe grammatical and more substantive differences in action. For example, at the beginning it was almost impossible for me to keep “para” and ”برای” (baraye) straight, since they sound similar and have a similar meaning. On the flip side, it was quite easy to translate verbs because the personal pronoun isn’t required in either language. On a more qualitative note, I noticed that in Farsi we were much more descriptive, e.g. calling this or that beautiful. In Spanish, we used more verbs to describe things happening, like we bought this cake at x store.

languagelearning,What I find interesting in the languages I have learned and want to learn,"I am aspiring to be a polyglot. I want to also be a hyperpolyglot. There are different things I find interesting about the languages I have learned and wish to learn. Here we go. 

I know a lot of French now. I find it interesting that French is like English in having more non-native than native speakers. It's interesting that I have found French relatively easy due to my knowledge of both English and Spanish now. Pronunciation is more difficult as there are many silent letters including the plural nouns. 

German is similar to English, and that is what I find interesting. German is easy to tell the nouns because they are all capitalized. German has a variety of plural nouns. The ß of German is unique to that language and it's interesting to me. 

Now that I am learning Romanian and Russian I want to tell what I find interesting in them. 

I find it interesting that Romanian has loanwords from Slavic languages. Romanian tends to end the plural nouns in e or i. 

In Russian I find it interesting that nouns are consistent in their gender. I find it interesting that Russian does not have articles. The Russian cases are consistent as to when to use them. 

I want to learn Bulgarian with another language after Romanian and Russian. I find it interesting that Bulgarian has no cases in the grammar. Bulgarian verbs tend to end with м, and I find it interesting. Bulgarian pronunciation is more consistent than Russian pronunciation too. 

In Turkish I also find the pronunciation interesting. I find Turkish beautiful. Turkish and other Turkic languages are so similar. 

In Portuguese I find it interesting that it is similar to Spanish. I find pronunciation in Portuguese to be easy. I love the sound of Portuguese. 

In Armenian I find the writing system to be interesting. No other language seems to use the Armenian script. It's interesting to find two main dialects in Armenian. Armenian is one of the few Indo-European languages to not belong to a subgroup. 

In Mandarin Chinese I find the writing system complicated yet interesting. I find it interesting that Chinese uses no plurals. Grammar in Chinese is easy. The tones sound interesting to me of Chinese. 

I find the writing system of Hindi to be interesting. Hindi is also in having words similar to English, so that sounds okay with me. It's great that Hindi is widely spoken too. 

I am planning on learning Bulgarian with another language after Romanian and Russian. I wonder what anyone else here finds interesting in languages they're learning.",1622847912,jga1992,5

Is there anything I can do other than just hunting down every Spanish speaker I can find and speaking at them until they go away to work on my speaking? Any exercises you would recommend? I clearly know the words on some level because I understand them in conversation and I can interpret them fluently, it’s just for some reason I can’t utilise them myself.

My my great hurdle is reading novels. I find them the hardest of all. I find all these words (particularly nouns) that I've never seen or heard before and I can't just gauge the meaning of from context either. Maybe it's because literary/descriptive language is different from what we use in our everyday.

Of course they're important to learn, but the sheer number of words per sentence that I don't know really puts me off because I have to painstakingly Google each one of them. Reading becomes such a task that I never do it.

I'm going to move to the Netherlands for university and I plan to learn one more foreign language (French or Dutch) all by myself.

However Dutch teaching and learning materials are very rare. I have no idea where I could find thorough materials for my whole process of studying.

In terms of French, I learned some basic French for 3 months and just quitted to finish my highschool diploma. French materials in my language are easy to find; the learner's community is very popular and supportive, too. 
I know that learning any foreign language will be beneficial anyway but I'm a bit confused: why French when I will be living in the Netherlands for at least 3 years? And French seems to be a super challenging language.

languagelearning,I'm wondering if this online language class I'm taking is effective or it's a waste of time.,"I'm taking an online Japanese proficiency test review class. The level I'm planning to take is N2 and I believe it's close to C2. This is a 2 hour class every weekday, we are around 8 people, and this is what typically happens.

1) Learn new set of vocabulary one by one. You read the vocabulary word, the definition in Japanese, a sample sentence, the teacher asks you to explain the sample sentence in Japanese, then the teacher asks you to use the new vocabulary word in a sentence. We take turns in doing this. It's around 20-30 per set.

2) When it's done, the teacher has everyone take turns just reading aloud the set of 20-30 new vocabulary words.

Now here's my issue with the class. With 2, this is something you could be doing in your own time but no, you gotta sit through others going reading through the wall of vocabulary. Even then, I don't know if reading aloud individual vocabulary words like that is an effective exercise. For a test where the only things being tested are reading and listening comprehension, there's barely any focus on those and there's way too much focus on speaking and having us paraphrase and form sentences. Even after you've used the new word in a sentence, the teacher tries to press harder on the new sentence you just made that you end up deviating from the original lesson. The teacher tries to justify this by saying that you gotta be trained to be able to form sentences and speak. Well okay it's not something I disagree with per se, but you'd think this would be more effective in a one on one class and if the speaking practice was done on an actual coherent conversation with context rather than randomly paraphrasing whatever sample sentence comes up or trying to forcibly use new vocabulary words in a sentence.

At any rate, the biggest issue really is you're spending most of the time waiting for your turn. If the teacher wanted to train us for speaking, you'd think it would be much more interactive than just waiting for your turn.

What do you guys think? Do you think is effective or no? Something about this particular class just doesn't sit right with me and I never felt this way in past classes.",1622797899,InsomniaEmperor,11

languagelearning,Recommendations for helping me out of a studying plateau?,"I have been studying Hungarian 2-4 hours on average every day since early December. My skill level is around A2-B1, with my reading probably being B1 and my other skills lower. 

My schedule includes at least an hour of Anki cards a day, sometimes as much as two and a half hours if I get behind on my schedule. I talk on iTalki 2-3 hours a week. I listen to A2 audio when I run or drive (I can understand some of it but not all of it.) I do book work in the Colloquial Hungarian book and MagyarOK book a couple times a week. 

I am sort of burnt out on Anki. At the same time, my listening needs to improve and one of my biggest difficulties when listening is not knowing vocabulary. I know around 2400 words. I am just spending a lot of time reviewing what I already know on Anki, not ever really using it in context, and therefore losing it easily/not caring much. 

Every time I hit a learning plateau like this it's because I need to mix up my strategies/resources and break through to the next level of learning, but I have tried a few different things and I am having trouble figuring out what I can do to get out of the rut.

languagelearning,"What does the literature say on optimal study times? I swear there was a thread for this, but I cannot find it; I'd like to reduce the time I spend in Anki","I used to do 1 10 30 1440 2880 3d 4d 7d 14d in Anki. I found I ended up spending a ton of time during the day on Anki, and eventually it became a lot to manage.

I recalled reading an article that said 1 10 1440 2d 3d 7d (emphasis on the 30 and 14d step missing) was okay because the brain will pick up things as it sees it again, and one does not need to kill themselves doing 1 10 30 a day.

Interest for this came because I noticed that when I saw something during my immersion, if I saw it once a day for a few days, eventually I absorbed it.

Lately, I switched to 1 10 1440... and noticed that things take a 1-2 days to sink in, but my review times have dropped from doing like 90+ minutes a day down to 30 minutes, which as you can guess, is a lot of time saved!

As such I want to see if there's anything the literature says whereby maybe I could be doing even more optimal learning. For example maybe 1 10 1440 2d 3d 7d is overkill and I only need something like 1 10 1440 3d, which would cut down on reviews.

I understand that this can be very specific for the person's brain in question, but I figure if people have done studies on this, it is reasonable to assume that I am probably in the normal distribution of people and would likely have benefit from such results.

If you know of such studies, or know the study results and can say what the final result was, I'd love that.",1622752685,user-1123581321,2

Hey guys, 
I’m sure a bunch of people in this community are foreigners that don't speak the language but wish they did. 
I am ready to offer a solution were we can have daily scheduled individual calls, where you can start getting the feel of speaking in arabic, making a conversation and building a sentence step by step.
It's more of a chat session and less of a class. 
And if we call it a class, then it's far away from being syllabus based or boring, but rather a non traditional easy going way of learning the language. That you can easily add an hour for it in your day.

I'm a native Arabic speaker, lived in KSA for 17 years  and then moved to Turkey for my 5 university years and currently I live in Jordan.

I have been tutoring English offline back then till now, and just recently started tutoring Arabic as well, and want to spread my work here over reddit, with a very symbolic rate for sessions :) 

Ofcourse you don't have to be a resident to message me XD just the will to learn Arabic!

languagelearning,Post-Apocalyptic languages in the America’s,"What linguist influences or changes will countries in North America or Caribbean, share 200 years after an apocalyptic event? Let’s say borders are gone, technology (cars, computers, internet, etc.) is unusable and rusted away, books are old and rotted, cities are gone and overgrown, and humans have become more tribal and hunter-gatherer, agrarian, or nomadic. Basically, like humans in the past.

Will these regions that border each other like Northern Mexico and Southern US, (or any region that borders another, like Canda and US, or Caribbean and Southern US/Eastern Mexico) influence each other’s languages, or accents? Would a sort of hybrid language emerge in any of the North American, or Caribbean countries? I imagine there are so many factors to include, like size of population, what groups of survivors are dominant and help eachother, and the amount of interaction they have, and I know there are native dialects in those regions too.

You stand up, and confirm: ""it's me"", or ""that's me"". Alternatively, someone calls on the phone asking for you by name. You answer ""it's him/her"", or ""it's me"".

In French we also use this form: ""C'est moi"". Sometimes when answering the phone ""lui-même"" (himself), rarer/more formal.

But in Spanish, this answer has the verb conjugated at the first person ""Soy yo"", ~I am or ""am, I"". I'm fairly sure it's the same in Portuguese.

A more general example, as a follow up to ""You stay here…"":
 
* The one leaving is me.

languagelearning,"Using CI [1] alongside other methods and/or [2] with ""latent"" languages?","A couple months ago I started experimenting with different apps/courses/methods. As I typically do with anything (not just languages) my initial steps are extremely unstructured and I try to compile all the materials I can, determine what is working / most enjoyable, and prune the rest.

I've been reading a lot about Comprehensible Input lately and I'm very intrigued. I'd like to hear about people's experience using CI in a couple different cases:

**If you are a beginner**, does pairing CI with other ""intuitive"" (but not TL-exclusive / input-only) methods like Glossika/Mango/Rocket work well? Or does output at any level interfere with CI? For me these languages are Russian and Thai—I started from scratch. 

With Russian for example, if the CI content is slow enough, then I try to break down what's happening when I hear a familiar word in a new grammatical context. So I'm not memorizing tables but I am still consciously aware of changes. 

With Thai, I actually learned to read *before* progressing on to anything else. Thai orthography is a dumpster fire so I'm glad I got this out of the way; I would *not* want to learn this after the fact. Now I have input at 3 levels: 

* Glossika gives me native speed audio with full English translations of random sentences (typing is frustrating af but that's another story),
* Mango gives me native audio of sentences in a particular real-world context (e.g., shopping) at a pace that I can comfortably retain in working memory for comprehension and production
* Some YouTube CI beginner Thai content I've found gives me SUPER slow audio with absolutely no English, and this is the speed I need to make sense of Thai without English as there is zero common ground in vocabulary

On the other hand, **if you have previous experience** but only **through more traditional methods**, is CI a good way to ""relearn"" the language (or, I suppose, truly acquire it for the first time)? 

I have some level of latent understanding of German and French from self-studying the traditional way when I was in high school (ages ago). To give you an idea, I watched some videos on the Natürlich German channel that was posted here yesterday and found the beginner playlist to be very much N+1 for me. I can hear all the words clearly, there is a good mix of vocab at different levels of familiarity⭑, and I can understand all the noun phrases clearly but would definitely not be able to reproduce the prepositions and articles myself.

⭑ what I mean is that there are words I would have been able to recall without watching the video, words that I understand as I watch (""Oh yeah, I remember that word""), and words that are new but understandable through context.",1622734059,tabidots,1

languagelearning,Language learning apps for kids,"Many of us have always been learning foreign languages for various reasons – travel and meeting new people, career and business, self-improvement and fun, etc.

The best way to succeed in learning a language is to start with it as a kid. The age of 5-12 is the most productive time for everyone, as your brain absorbs any information fast and retains it for a long time.

Are you planning to create a language learning app that kids will love? Study the main aspects of such a startup before you contact the developers and discuss further details.

Statistically, 80% of young Europeans (aged 15-30) speak at least one foreign language. Many of them have learned it or improved their school knowledge with different kinds of apps and websites. The main benefits of E-learning are availability at any time and place, convenience, and low prices. If you create an app like that, it can bring you a steady income – for instance, the global market of digital English learning solutions is the most profitable, with revenue estimated at over $4 billion in 2018 and predicted to reach [$54.9 billion by 2027](https://in.finance.yahoo.com/news/english-language-learning-market-worth-103000685.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAItqfPL5oMfuAz5nBxPr-w4s72iiTq6bhfmwM5eFLXt3JZ5hE9JjnweWNg4nyfPV26F9hiQWgSFmCCbLgi5LsbIeAiiX0VcbWtU87NisN75FQMNoArT6QKm_wF4HlZGSMpQzJUc6MtmBIvo1BGTeSNMjGzjlhzgkKlMUjRyBMBDD).

There are lots of other popular apps for children and teenagers helping them learn foreign languages. For example:

* [EASY peasy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/easy-peasy-english-for-kids/id1333510892) – an English learning app for kids aged 5-7 and older;
* [Mindsnacks](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-spanish-by-mindsnacks/id385497068) – a series of language learning apps for kids and adults; it includes popular offers like Spanish and French alongside rarer options, e.g., Japanese;
* [Lirica](https://www.lirica.io/) – a clever app for teens aged 12-13 and older; it helps learn world languages with the lyrics of pop hits.
* [Duolingo](https://duolingo.com/) is one of the most successful language learning apps for kids and adults. It has become world-famous and earned over $100 million for six years.

In the current market, you’ll find the following types of language learning apps and websites:

1. **Digital courses** like [Duolingo](https://duolingo.com/), [Rosetta Stone](https://www.rosettastone.com/) (both have versions of their products to help kids learn foreign languages), [Mondly Kids](https://mondly.com/) or [FluentU](https://www.fluentu.com/);
2. **Flashcards-based and other repetition apps** like [Drops](https://languagedrops.com/), [Anki App](https://www.ankiapp.com/), or [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/);

languagelearning,"Some help with ""Literally"" [PT-BR/ENG]","Hello, everyone.

I'm thinking about translating some youtube videos I like to my first language, and the word ""Literally"" raised two questions... but I don't really know in what sub I should post it on. So if it's not here, please tell me where I should take this.

&amp;#x200B;

So, to the first question:

It's a super common ocurrence in english nowadays to use the word ""literally"" in three of five sentences when speaking informally. They use it without the meaning being literal at all or without necessity. In portuguese \[PT-BR\], this is treated as a grammar concept called ""language addiction"", but is there a similar term or grammar concept for it in english that I can search about? Or it's just treated as colloquialism?

&amp;#x200B;

Second question:

While translating it, should I omit this kind of term or translate it literally? There is nothing similar in portuguese to soften the translation, so I guess it's do or hide situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for the help, sorry if I posted in the wrong sub and for any grammar issues.",1622685830,brownisnice,9

languagelearning,"Which language would you suggest? French, Russian, or Spanish?","Hey everyone! Hope you are doing well! Today I wanted to ask a question, that being which language of the three listed would you suggest I peruse? Overwhelmed by choice, I'm really not sure :( I speak and read English fluently, and I am also fluent in spoken Arabic. When I was young I studied German and French, and found German very easy. With French, I may go to a Francophone country, and I know some French speakers, the language isn't too difficult I feel with some effort, and I do like the language as well, however. French media and and music are phenomenal, I'd love to be able to watch them in French without subtitles, but I'm not as passionate as I am with Russian. Russian and the Russian culture are my passion. I am in love with the Russian culture, history, etc.. But what happened when I started learning was that I couldn't get into the language. I tried so much, but I just found it too difficult. A simple hello took me a while to wrap my head around, while the alphabet still confuses me occasionally. I also may not find too much use for Russian besides watching movies, music, and traveling to Eastern Europe, while with French I can do those as well as perhaps find better employment opportunities and more speakers to help me learn the language more. As for Spanish, well I'd love to learn just because of the hospitality and friendliness of Latin American's I've met throughout my life. While I'm not sure about movies (if you know any good Mexican or Argentinian movies/series I'd love to watch them :D). It also may have travel uses and job opportunities. But I don't know many native speakers currently, and I'm not sure how difficult it would be to learn.

What I use it for:
- Posting transcripts of very short news articles 
- Writing practice for a range of topics 
- I’m definitely mid beginner level so use to double check what I’m writing makes sense

Pros:
- I have never had a post go unedited by other members. No matter what/ when I’ve posted I’ll always receive some feedback pretty quickly 

- People are very friendly and really want to help each other out! Even if they are long posts or transcriptions 

- Very easy platform to use and the comments ability is a great function. I’ll sometimes get multiple suggestions for what is ‘proper grammar’ and all of the comments are useful 

Cons: 
- Someone can easily only speed read through your post and only pick up some errors. I try and keep my posts mostly short so that I can get any many corrections as I can - I can only trust that I end up with a ‘grammatically correct’ post after all comments have been made 

- I’m lazy and I know I should go through and make my corrections and note them for next time! And yet I haven’t been 

- It’s a little annoying that once you go into a post and exit out you end back at the start but there aren’t masses of posts to scroll back through

languagelearning,1 year learning Spanish from scratch,"This week marks one year since I’ve begun learning Spanish. I started from scratch, having learned English and German during my studies. Being French gave me a head start but I thought it would be interesting to do a little assessment of my journey so far. 

I started with music because it’s what got me into English. It means that during the first six weeks I was listening almost exclusively to songs in Spanish. I used a website to learn grammar (I recommend [https://www.espagnolfacile.com/](https://www.espagnolfacile.com/) for french learners) and translated lots of lyrics. I also decided to learn the 2,000 most used words. It may seem weird but I also read lots of Wikipedia entries about subjects that interested me. It seemed to me that it was fairly easy to understand and helped me learn vocabulary about my hobbies. After the first 2 months I implemented a routine that I’m still following to this day. 

**Reading** **–** *23 books = 8179 pages since September*

I started reading books for natives after three months. With a little help from my mother tongue, I could guess the meaning of many words I did not know. I read every day during my commute and underline the words I don’t know. I then look them up in a dictionary and add them to my Anki deck if they seem useful. At first I had to limit myself to 35 new words every day and leave a lot of obscure ones behind, now I struggle to make it to 35, even with the most obscure ones. My Anki deck contains about 7,500 cards, some of them containing several synonyms. Here are the books I’ve read so far:

1- El desorden que dejas – Carlos Montero (402 p) 

2-  Puerto escondido – María Oruña (428 p)

3- El guardián invisible – Dolores Redondo (427 p)

4- Relato de un náufrago – Gabriel García Márquez (170 p)

5- Ofrenda a la tormenta – Dolores Redondo (543 p

6- La vida a veces – Carlos del Amor (237 p)

7- Las aventuras del Capitán Alatriste – Arturo y Carlota Pérez-Reverte (217 p)

8- Legado en los huesos – Dolores Redondo (549 p)

9- El mapa del tiempo – Félix J. Palma (670 p) 

10- Cien años de soledad – Gabriel García Márquez (495p)  

11- El oro del rey – Arturo Pérez-Reverte (248 p)

12- Historia de España contada para escépticos – Juan Eslava Galán (500 p)

13- Como agua para chocolate – Laura Esquivel (272 p)

14- El Túnel – Ernesto Sabato (155 p) 

15- Los santos inocentes – Miguel Delibes (180 p)

16- Limpieza de sangre - Arturo Pérez-Reverte (231 p)

17- Un millón de gotas – Víctor del Arbol (668 p)

18- Nada – Carmen Laforet (275 p)

19- El Alquimista – Paulo Coelho (190 p)

20- La piel fría – Albert Sánchez Piñol (279 p )

21- El hermano pequeño – J. M. Guelbenzu (389 p)

22- El caballero del jubón Amarillo – Arturo Pérez-Reverte (319 p)

23- La fiesta del chivo – Mario Vargas Llosa (525 p)

 **Listening -**

I started my listening practice with slowed down Youtube videos with subtitles and podcasts for learners (I really enjoyed Unlimited Spanish) and then graduated to movies y series for natives, first with subtitles, then without. Since September, I’ve watched content almost exclusively in Spanish. I alternate between videos and podcasts. I’ve really been enjoying the podcasts because I can listen to them while doing something else, and what’s more, meanwhile I’m practicing my listening, I can learn other things (Spanish culture, politics, science, movies…). I’d say that on average I listen to two hours of content every day, and more on the weekends. I feel quite confident in my listening. I sometimes don’t get jokes but I think it’s more of an ignorance of colloquialisms than a listening problem. I’ve mostly been listening to content from Spain though, so I probably need to practice more my understanding of Latin American accents.

**Writing -**

Since December I’ve been writing everyday on r/WriteStreakES. First it was really hard but now I feel like I can write complex sentences and express myself precisely, I can even add a little humor when I want to. Of course, I still can’t write without mistakes but I’m making less and less. You can see my texts on my profile to get an idea of my level. I think the reading helps a lot because it teaches me turns of phrases and a lot of vocabulary. 

**Speaking -**

I got a tutor on Italki in September and I’ve been having one class every week with her ever since. Then, in November, I added another tutor with whom I only do conversation classes, which means that we talk about various topics for an hour. I feel I’ve gotten much more confident and the words come more and more naturally. I still struggle a lot with the use of the subjunctive when I speak. Other than that, I really need to learn colloquial Spanish because I tend to use vocabulary from the books I’ve read, which probably doesn’t sound very natural. In addition, once every two weeks I’m having a chat with a Mexican friend, we talk for two or three hours about any kind of topics. That means that every week I spend on average three hours talking. It’s not a lot but still much more than I did for English or German at school.

All in all, I would say I’m a solid B2. Which seems to been a good assessment as my Italki tutor told me we just finished the B2 syllabus. I’m very happy with my progress, I feel like I really took advantage of the pandemic ;-) My next goal is to take the C1 DELE test in November.",1622658366,VM_LOTR_2020,91

languagelearning,Is this effective learning?,"Hey all!

Started Albanian language (somewhat intensive as a day job, 6 hrs a day, 5 days a week + HW) but i’m struggling a bit with my instructors methods and wanted to check if my frustration is sound or not.

Part of the course is with textbooks. My instructor states the textbooks don’t introduce everything in the right order, so he introduces somewhat homemade material of Word docs with small lessons on them + questions.

The problem for me is, while I intuitively understand the concepts, a lot of material is introduced at once. IE: Definite / indefinite / plural / singular / feminine / masculine, in Albanian, nouns change based on ALL of the above. A lot of different verbs, vocab, and grammar are brushed over and when time comes for me to replicate via HW or speaking, I’m lost in the blue as to what form of noun or verb to use or what the hell half the words even mean.

When I perform textbook work, it will introduce a group of vocab, a rule or two, then have me apply what I learned in lessons and workbooks. 

The textbook is intuitive and feels like i’m building blocks step by step. I have a reference to return to if I forget, and can apply what I’ve learned.

Instructor homebrew feels like a frustrating migraine everytime, I often have no reference for new words (I use google translate half the time) or new grammar and have to guess. I then get it wrong, have no idea if my phrases are accurate, and sound like an idiot the next day. He states it’s okay to make mistakes, doesn’t expect me to be perfect. But I still feel I don’t get it. I would rather move thru the textbook at a quicker pace with what I know, then hop around between various word docs  and be lost on why a word is definite here but indefinite there. I don’t feel i’m actually picking up half of what is covered.",1622639414,Epic_Beast,6

So by my flair, you guys could probably tell that my TL is Brazilian Portuguese. I'm approaching the 2 year anniversary of starting my learning journey.
So I'll try to keep this as laconic as possible: I visited Brazil this past March (bad timing I know) for a month. Had a damn blast. Anyways, I thought I was prepared to talk with the natives, and it turned out that I was only somewhat prepared in that my understanding of someone varied depending on their accent; ranging from pretty much everything to ""what the fuck is this guy saying?"" I made it a habit to talk to my uber drivers and friends profusely in order to practice and immerse myself, and while I could speak, listening was a different story.
Anyways, 2 months later and besides some sporadic voice clips here and there, I did not practice listening at all. And yet, my listening comprehension skyrocketed to the point where I can understand most people and telenovelas without difficulty (save for those with extremely thick accents). This wasn't the case before and I'm confused, though pleased.

I mean, I want to learn the languages which allow me to interact with the people I'm most interested in. If there were billions speaking a certain language and I weren't drawn to that culture, I wouldn't care about that language. It's as simple as that. I value speaking the languages that would get me to learn about the cultures I'm interested in.  

I get that people want to be time-efficient and, from an outside perspective, it might seem that the most efficient way is to learn the mainstream ones first. I get that. There are some economic benefits, too. But I think that's a different kind of question.

languagelearning,"1 Year (1000+ hours) of Portuguese: milestones, current level and reflections","I started self-learning Portuguese 1 year ago and had no clue how far I'd be able to get in a year, what methods worked best, or if I would lose interest quickly. Most people I know told me that language learning is a very, very long process and that it is not very easy to achieve significant results within a year. While that *is* true, I thought it might be a nice investment of the extra time I had because of pandemic lockdowns (which are still in place in my country, unfortunately). Anyway, I hope this helps give an idea of what kind of progress it is possible to make in a year with intensive focus. 

&gt;Summary: I spent a total of **1040 hours** over the past 12 months studying and consuming Portuguese content from scratch. My main focus was on reading and writing. As of now, I have managed to read 36 books (mostly novels) with a total of around 6,500 pages. I can understand most TV shows and podcasts, but encounter many unknown words and expressions. As for writing, feel free to see my post history. **And here is an audio clip I just recorded of me speaking:** [https://vocaroo.com/1enxNocp1hKl](https://vocaroo.com/1enxNocp1hKl). Any feedback is much appreciated!

Background information: my native languages are Hindi, English and Odia. I can also understand several other Indian regional languages, but I had never tried learning a foreign language before picking up Portuguese. 

Motivation: My main aim was to be able to read academic scholarship in the fields of history and archaeology and perhaps some documents from the 16th-18th century (I'm a history student, and this is what interests me). Secondary aim was to be able to communicate coherently with Portuguese-speaking people via writing. In the beginning, I wasn't very invested in building listening or speaking skills, but then I absolutely fell in love with the sound of Portuguese as it's spoken in Portugal, Angola and Moçambique.

Here is what my progress looked like:

**Month 1:** learned a handful of words and their English meanings, practiced some simple present tense verb conjugations. Struggled a lot with pronunciation and finding resources for European Portuguese. Could not distinguish any words at all in spoken content. 

**Month 2:** Learned more words by making physical flashcards and started making simple sentences. Also bought a textbook and started making my way through A1. Had a major breakthrough at the end of the month: sat through an entire hour of a TV show about Portugal's history (subtitled) and understood certain sentences and quite a few words. Also could understand simple blog posts, but had to look up a lot of words.

**Month 3:** Finished reading my first book in Portuguese (Morte no Nilo, Agatha Christie, 300 pages). Comprehension was very low and I had a hard time understanding full sentences. Did know a lot of words, though. Tenses were also hard to identify. 

**Month 4:** Finally understood (rather, got the gist of) a full episode of a telenovela with subtitles and understood bits and pieces from podcasts aimed towards children. Still struggled with conjugations.

**Month 5:** Non-subtitled YouTube and news reports were getting easier to understand. Spoken accent got a lot better (checked back using recordings).

**Month 6:** Ditched subtitles and still understood a lot of TV content. The speed of natives speaking was the hardest challenge. Finished reading my 20th book in Portuguese. It was easy to read long sentences now without translating them word-to-word. Still struggled with grammar and output (writing). 

**Month 7:** Continued to understand more and more without subtitles. Also could understand slowly-speaking natives in podcasts and on the radio. Writing was still hard because I had to keep translating in my head.

**Month 8:** Easily understood dialogues in telenovelas (but often did not know the meaning of words and expressions despite recognizing them) and finally started to relax while consuming native content. 

**Month 9:** Started writing on r/WriteStreakPT and a major breakthrough happened: I started to finally think directly in Portuguese. Still made a lot of writing mistakes, but could communicate my thoughts. In terms of TV and podcasts, I could pick out unknown words I heard and usually spell them correctly. The other stuff I could understand with a little effort.

**Month 10:** Combined writing and reading and stopped mixing Brazilian and European Portuguese while writing. Understood most of the jokes from a stand-up comedy sketch without subtitles. Read a few academic articles and could understand them with minimal look-ups. 

**Month 11:** Watched a lot of dubbed animated movies and understood almost 100 per cent. I could also watch telenovelas, series, and documentaries with clear voices without focusing too much. Had my first conversation with a native: could understand her fully, but my responses were badly formed. I was understandable, however.

**Month 12:** Finished reading my first Portuguese classic (19th century), *Amor de Perdição* and understood more than I had expected to*.* Also finished a 500-odd pages long historical fiction written originally in Portuguese with relative ease. Participated in an online workshop conducted by a Portuguese university about a historical issue and understood the discussion without problems. 

**What is my current level?** I can:

\- Understand any telenovela/series/podcast/documentary/animated movie, given that there is not too much background noise or a lot of slang. I still struggle with understanding accents of people from Northern Portugal, Madeira and Azores. 

\- Understand most of contemporary fiction, given that I have access to a dictionary. In many cases, I can also appreciate subtle differences in word choice by the author and the use of different sentence structures to emphasis certain elements. 

\- Write about familiar topics without too much effort. I am familiar with and do know how to incorporate quite a few idiomatic expressions, but while my writing is mostly understandable, it still seems unnatural at times. Here are two examples of long-ish texts from this month: \[«Equador» de Miguel Sousa Tavares\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/WriteStreakPT/comments/nenzcm/streak\_106\_opini%C3%A3o\_equador\_de\_miguel\_sousa\_tavares/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WriteStreakPT/comments/nenzcm/streak_106_opini%C3%A3o_equador_de_miguel_sousa_tavares/)) and \[Gandhi\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/WriteStreakPT/comments/nh9aq0/streak\_109\_gandhi/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WriteStreakPT/comments/nh9aq0/streak_109_gandhi/))

\- Participate in a conversation as long as it involves me making short remarks. With longer sentences, I get flustered and usually mess up grammatical usage. I can by myself, however, identify my own mistakes. My pronunciation is okay and does not greatly hamper others from understanding me. I've linked a recording of me speaking at the top). 

I would say I am around a B2 level, with my speaking being my worst skill (which makes sense, considering that it has not been a priority for me). Perhaps I am overestimating my level? I would love it if someone with more experience in language learning could help me out here (I've checked the CEFR criteria, but I'm still a little doubtful).

languagelearning,Inuktitut basics 2 (posting here to try it out. Lesson 1 is in r/LearnASkill,"Refer to lesson 1 for references on how to pronounce different letters and to get resources. 

::::Subject of the verb::::
The people/person you want to talk about must be indicated with an affix. By using different affixes, you can talk about multiple people doing the same thing. 

If the root word ends in a vowel, the affix will keep J as it’s starting letter. 
Example— 
Nirijunga = I eat 
Nirijutit = you eat 
Nirijusik = you eat (x2) 
Nirijusi = you eat (x3+) 
Nirijuguk = we eat (x2) 
Nirijugut = we eat (x3+) 
Nirijuuk = they eat (x2) 
Nirijut = they eat (x3+) 
Nirijuq = he/she eats 

If the root ends in a consonant, you have to change the J I’m the affix, to a T. 
Example— 
Itsiktunga = I’m afraid 
Itsiktutit = you’re afraid 
Itsiktusik = you’re afraid (x2) 
Itsiktusi = you’re afraid (x3+) 
Itsiktuguk = we’re afraid (x2) 
Itsiktugut = we’re afraid (x3+) 
Itsiktuuk = they’re afraid (x2) 
Itsiktut = they’re afraid (x3+) 
Itsiktuq = he/she is afraid 
—————————————————————
::::Personal Pronouns::::
In English, a verb must be paired with a word that indicates who is completing an action. 
Example— I eat, SHE sleeps, THEY walk. (The words that state who is completing the action are called personal pronouns). 

Inuktitut has personal pronouns, but they aren’t used as often because the verb ending already states who is completing the action. 

For the times they’re used, here are the simplest personal pronouns: 
Uvanga = I/me 
Ivvit = you 
Ilitisk = you (x2) 
Ilitsi = you (x3+) 
Uvaguk = we/us (x2) 
Uvagut = we/us (x3+) 

Personal pronouns are usually only used when : 
1) you’re talking about someone/something without a verb. 
2) you’re adding emphasis. 
Example dialogue— 
“Qanuinngirtunga. Ivvilli?” —&gt; I’m fine. What about you? 
“Uvanga? Qanuinngimmijunga.” —&gt; me? I’m fine as well. 

::::Affixes LI and LU::::
Li is used when you want to change the person or object you want to talk about.
Example— 
ivvit+li = Ivvili? —&gt; what about you? 
Uvanga+li = Uvangali? —&gt; what about me? 

Lu is used as an ending meaning and/too/as well. 
Example—
Uvangalu, uirngarmijunga. —&gt; I’m tired too. 

When Li and Lu are added to a pronoun ending with a consonant, the consonant has to change to an L. 
Example — 
Ivvit+Li = Ivvili —&gt; what about you?
Ivvit+lu = ivvilu—&gt; you too.

languagelearning,One Month Progress in Russian/Русский 🇳🇱🇳🇱,"Привет всем,

I started learning Russian exactly a month ago and this is my one month progress post. I will try to update 2-3 months from now on, if I don't that probably means I gave up or died or something like that.

Also this post is pretty big and detailed so I have made an index and headings for all the points so that it is easier to read. 

**Index**

•Introduction &amp; Background

•Learning Process

•Progress

•Difficulties 

•Interesting Linguistic Observations (really recommend to read)

•Conclusion 

#Introduction &amp; Background

Here's a brief introduction. I (19M) speak 3 languages, Bengali (N), English (pretty fluent, also currently studying English Literature in University) and Hindi (native level fluency but can't write or read the script). I consider Russian as my first proper attempt at learning a foreign language because most educated people here speak those 3 anyway (and everyone speaks at least 2). 

I attempted to learn Spanish when I was younger and used to watch La Liga but I didn't really know how to proceed and gave up. I also tried to learn German at the start of the quarantine but didn't find it much interesting so stopped. It's also important to mention that most of my English learning has come from watching movies and internet after the age of 14. I did not go to an English medium school and the teachers didn't do much other than making us memorize ""do-did-done, take-took-taken"". Similar thing with Hindi. Like most other kids, I learned Hindi through watching cartoons, powerrangers and cricket. That's why I can speak it but can't read it. 

So keeping in mind the things that didn't work for Spanish and German and the things that worked for English, I began learning Russian.

#Learning Process

I'm using the book ""New Russian Book for Penguins"". I am not using Dualingo or any other word memorization/flash card service. Because before vocabulary I want to get a good base of grammar first. I made this mistake with Spanish when I was just memorizing random words but didn't know how to use them. So my vocabulary at this moment is very small. 

Contrary to what I have seen on internet, learning Cyrilic was very easy. I think I was done within 2 hours. I have chose to not cursive though. I'm visually disable (65% vision in right eye and 6% in left eye) and I find English cursive hard to read (when I write I leave some space between all the characters) and Russian cursive is even harder. My goal is to be able to speak and understand anyway and not learning cursive won't hurt much (like Hindi). 

I usually study 1 to 1 and a half hour everyday. I can do more but I spend all my time browsing YouTube and Reddit. 

#Progress

I have learned the present tense and the conjugation. If I know the stem and which type of verb it is (usually I can understand the easy ones) then I can conjugate it. 

I have learned 4 cases so far. Nominative, prepositinal, accusative and genitive. Except genitive the other 3 were pretty simple. I have understood the concept of the genitive but remembering all the endings is pretty hard, especially for genitive plural.

I have also learned adjectives. The prepositional and accusative endings for adjectives are a little confusing as there are many of them. Actually I will try to write them here right now without looking them up. Let's see how many I get right.

Ом for the endings ыи, ий and ое (masculine and neutar), ем for нии type, ой for feminine and ей for feminine нии type (Я работаю в новом ресторане). For accusative, if the inanimate doesn't change the adjective doesn't change. For animate M it's ого and его (Мы любим наш нового красивого соседа). I can't remember the feminine and inanimate ones unfortunately. 

I have learned plurals as well but they are also slightly confusing depending on the case.

I have learned to count. Шестьдесят девят.

#Difficulties

The biggest problem I have faced so far is the spelling and the stress. First of all I still have no idea what that stress mark actually does or why is it important. I have listened to some Russian words with and without the stress and I didn't spot much difference in average speed. Spelling is also tough, how do you know it's и or й when both of them sounds the same? Same can be said for о and а in some instances. Then in some words there is a ь randomly. The sentences I wrote above, I spelt almost all the words wrong, it was autocorrect that fixed it. I can say some words for example but can't spell it, like здравствуйте (autocorrect used). 

As speaking is my main goal, not writing, I don't think this will effect much right? As long as I can say it properly?

#Interesting Linguistic Observations

Even though I am learning from an English speaker's perspective, I am not a native English speaker and I can't help but notice the some striking similarities between Bengali and Russian. Noticing the similarities and differences has been the most интерксый part so far. There are some things that doesn't exist in English but exist in Bengali. Here are some examples.

● We both don't use articles so the sentence structure is very same, almost identical.

● Это is similar to  এটা (eta). They both sound and mean the same thing (though in Bengali it's only for inanimate nouns). So a sentence like Это TV/Eta TV means the exact same thing in both languages.

● Есть is Bengali আছে (aachhe). Both are used exact same way. And Нет (as the opposite of есть) is Bengali নেই (nei). So Bengali translation of TV есть would be TV aachhe. 

● Bengali also have formal and informal pronoun for you. We actually have e of them (very formal, very informal and something between the two). What is funny is that Russian Ты is exactly like Bengali তুই (tui). They both means and even sounds the same and both are informal. 

There are some other subtle similarities as well but this post is getting too long. The biggest difference is however that the Russian words are far harder to pronounce. No offence but I'm breaking my teeth trying to pronounce some words. Who the fuck says здравствуйте (zdrastvooitye) for hello? 

#Conclusion

Thanks for reading this far. I have spent too much time writing this post. This is what happens when you have no friends. Anyway, due to the lack of vocabulary I can't write in Russian to give you a sample. So instead I will write some simple sentences in English to show my level. I would be able to translate such sentences if I knew all the words. In bracket are the words I don't know, otherwise I know the prepositions, cases, structures, conjugation of these simple sentences.

《""Ivan Ivanovic is sitting on a chair (sit, chair). He is writing a letter for his girlfriend (write). Suddenly he hears some knocks on the door (suddenly, hear, knock). He opens the door and sees Putin (open, see). ""How is going Товарищ?"", Putin whispers and enters the room (whisper, enter). ""Неплохо"", replies Ivan and closes the door (reply, close).》",1622569499,Username_4477,10
languagelearning,Scan to speech app (Android),"i'm trying to relearn french so i've gotten a french novel to read from out loud.

Is there an app where i can take a picture of a book and it will read it out to me in french? ( and possibly translate it?  i do know of apps that translate so that's not as important right)

languagelearning,Duolingo is fun but need something with no audio for Japanese,"Hi folks !

What the title says.  I started Duolingo today to refresh and catch up on the languages I used to  speak as a child.  That's fine and I am having a blast !  All of those languages are European and use the same alphabet. I can't use audio, so I am just skipping those questions.

I'd like to learn Japanese mostly just to be able to read/write it. This is a problem because Duolingo's way of teaching Alphabet seems to be asking you what you  hear and having you pick the letter. I Could use a graph for this, but I'd rather not.

So, I guess the question is which app is best to use to learn all the Japanese writing systems, that does not rely on sound ? I know a very few Kanji ( prolly about 50-80?) and  can pick out certain letters  but I  am no where near having  the writing systems memorized.

I do plan on picking up Genki 1, but I'd like to get a start a bit sooner. I'm hoping to  read at JLPT N3 eventually. If that helps, possibly N2, we will see how it goes.

Would Memrise be my best bet ? Or busuu? Or something else?

languagelearning,Language Learning Inspiration/Motivation,"Hi guys!

As I'm sure everyone on this page knows, learning a language can be difficult and I don't mean that in the traditional sense of ""oh it's hard to remember conjugations"". I think one of the biggest problems I personally struggle with is consistency and keeping my motivation up. I feel super motivated when I first start or am able to see a lot of progression but there's times I've hit a plateau and I don't see myself improving so I lose the drive to keep going. That or life gets in the way for a little and then you haven't practiced in so long you keep using ""life"" as an excuse when it's really because you've lost inspiration and motivation to practice. 

My question to everyone is how to do you stay motivated or get yourself out of that funk? I'd love to hear any and all ideas. If anyone has any good tips, blogs, YouTube vids, etc that help them get inspired again I'd love to see them!",1622567213,Pretty-Brick8995,3

languagelearning,what are your best tips to revise/review previous lessons?,"when i first studying japanese, i was very well organized and planned what type of homework/materials i would study for each day of the week. tuesdays are for the 5 minna no nihongo books, wednesdays are for the extra home work that my sensei has for us, thursdays and fridays are for the genki workbook and saturday and sundays are for pronunciation practice, vocabulary and kanji. 

i was doing great and understood a lot but as the lessons grew harder, i began to lose motivation. i stopped following my schedule and i ended up taken a month long break from japanese which resulted in me forgetting a lot of things. i’m struggling with homework, especially particles, and i don’t know what to do anymore. 

right now, i’m rewriting my notes from previous lessons in hopes that it will stimulate my brain to remember what i’ve learned and i’ll be re-answering my old homework to get the hang of it but i also feel like wasting my time.

i want to drop out of class because i’m just so lost and feel discouraged to continue but then i remember how far i’ve come and how excellent my grade was for the midterm and i feel guilty.

languagelearning,Mixed languages ban,"Hello, bilinguals! What do you think about mixed languages? Do your officials ban/discourage their usage?


Achtung, long story long!


In my big city, Kharkiv, which is Eastern Ukraine close to Russia, there are:

+ various rural dialects from the older East Slavic dialect continuum, unfortunately dying out due to the urbanisation going since USSR
+ a spoken local Russian variety + written Standart Ukrainian (also used in mass media, many schools and official contexts)  i.e. a typical diglossia
+ an urban macaronic variety called Surzhyk, characterised by a lack of proficiency in one of source languages, emerging when monolinguals are forced to use a language they poorly know
+  !! nativized/creolized Surzhyk originated from some rural communities in USSR; my mother and granny seems to be native speakers of such variety, but they only use it with one another

All the rural dialects and mixed varieties are labeled with the derogatory term Surzhyk and highly disapproved (

As for me, I even can't understand if I am bilingual. Like, I've been raised in Russian at home but have been in contact with Ukrainian everywhere since early childhood. Thanks to school and literature, I know both the standart varieties, but something inside holds me from mixing them (most of the time), maybe because my mother kept me away from Surzhyk &amp; discouraged macaronic usage. I speak and think 95% of the time in good Russian, unless it's about linguistics, then I can only think in my poorly learned English :/",1622539609,c-lan,8

I love both languages alot and their countries to go with them. I've already started learning Russian a bit, maybe haft way to A1.  


I really enjoy learning Russian but i feel like Japanese would be more useful as i would like to live in Japan one day. I don't really feel like living in Russia not to say i don't want to visit Russia.  


Russian feels easier just from the reading aspect, i mean 32 letters for Cyrillic is much easier then the over 5000 letters that are spread over the 3 alphabeats Japanese has to offer, and overall Japanese feels overwhelming but also feels like i'd get so much more use out of it, if i could get over that fact.

languagelearning,Babbel Live class experience,"So Babbel added a live classes sometime earlier this year, where users can take a class with an instructor and other students. I took one today and wanted to talk about my experience for anyone who was interested! Disclaimer: I use Babbel for Spanish and I’m also a beginner, so the experience might be different for other languages and/or more experienced people.

Structure:
So there are classes basically all day because the instructors come from around the world. Each class is an hour long, and they’re labeled by two things: 1) the level of the class (A1, A2, B1, etc through C1) and 2) the topic of the class. Each class has a topic that corresponds with level of the class, so the A1/A2 classes go over more basic/beginner topics like talking about your talents or about your family, and the more experienced levels talk about more difficult concepts like expressing your hopes and fears. Additionally the more experienced levels expect you to understand more grammar/vocab. 

The classes also are with other people. As you sign up for class, it will tell you how many seats are left or if it’s fully booked. My class was with 3 other people, but I noticed some classes had up to 6 seats open.

My experience:
I took my first class today! Booking is very easy, I did it literally the night before. Before you sign up for the class, you’re able to access class-related material to review/have during the class. 

The class I signed up for was an A2 level class and it was about talents, abilities, bothers. I took the class with 3 other students, which I felt like was a perfect size. The instructor was really great — he spoke in Spanish the entire time so it really pushed me to listen and understand, the material required us to talk basically the entire time (although we took turns obviously), and he was very encouraging. I also personally enjoyed the class being with other people because it felt like less pressure/less awkward. The hour went by so fast.

Overall, I thought this is an awesome feature of Babbel. I pay like $6/month for Babbel, and I get two classes per billing cycle. Although that’s obviously not a lot of classes, it’s pretty great for paying $6/month, plus all the other features of Babbel. I think Babbel Live would be really great for anyone nervous to take a live class and beginners in particular. I’m now super excited to use my next class, and feeling less nervous about getting a more consistent tutor on iTalki in the future.

🔹 This is to help you estimate how much general progress you think you’ve made. If you did not study to your goal, that’s okay! Maybe the goal was already too big. Or maybe you had too many distractions. 

Or maybe you didn’t study to your goal amount but still feel like you learned a lot! All of these things matter.


🔸🔸🔸


3: Did you take any breaks during 
your study session? For how long?

🔹 This is to help you gauge how much you are NOT studying and how often you are resting. Rest is so important. 
Studies have shown that taking breaks in between studying actually helped for more efficient learning as compared to straight cram studying for hours straight. 

Drink some water, have a snack. Watch some tv. Work out. Text and chat with your friends, whatever you like to do the most!


🔸🔸🔸


4: If yes, what did you do during 
those breaks? Were they necessary 
or procrastination?

🔹 When you took your breaks, were they to help your studying or to actually delay it? Were you scrolling through your phone after a good session, or were you using your phone when you should have been studying?

Did you go eat some food because you were hungry from hard work, or because you were bored and started wandering to your fridge? Remember, breaks are to help your learning, not to impede it! 



🔸🔸🔸


5: Did you have any distractions today? 
If so, what were they? Could you have 
avoided any of these distractions? 

🔹 Reflect on what stopped you from progressing in your studies today. Was it things you couldn’t change? Did you have to babysit your little sister? Take something to the post office or go grocery shopping? Work? School? 

You cannot avoid these things and you should never blame yourself for things you cannot control. You will progress in the time that is permitted to you! 

Did you lay in your bed and watch a new show that you’ve been waiting for instead of studying? If yes, then dedicate your break time to this show or thing! 

Don’t stop doing what you like, just allocate this time to when you’re not studying. Tell yourself you will watch that new show LATER when you take a break.

Because knowing that you have a designated time for those sorts of things helps you to not have it in the back of your mind and leave studying to go do it. As long as you’ve told yourself there is a time coming to do it, you will surely be able to stay focused. 



🔸🔸🔸



6: Did you study what you had planned
originally? Or did you switch goals?


🔹 Sometimes we end up studying something else than what we thought we would that day. And that’s okay, you can just move that subject for tomorrow. Especially if it is equally important. 

I didn’t study French verbs today but I will study them tomorrow because I did adjectives instead!

Just make sure you note that you diverted from the original plan, because sometimes when we study something different than what we wanted, we end up forgetting and not studying that thing at all later! 



🔸🔸🔸


7: Did you briefly review the difficult 
concepts that you had learned
last study session?

🔹 Reviewing what you learned is just as important as inputting new information. There is no point to studying if you cannot retain what you’ve learned from last time. 

I suggest before you start your new concepts for the day, take some time to study those super hard concepts from yesterday. Look up that weird word you vaguely remember. Go through your notes and catch how many things you didn’t remember until just now. 

I am very guilty of learning difficult concepts and then moving on immediately and never reviewing them again. Even though I “learned” it and want to move on, I didn’t actually study efficiently because I didn’t remember it later...


🔸🔸🔸



8: Reflect, was today a good day of 
healthy studying? If yes, great! 

🔹 The question isn’t “did you study a whole bunch?”, it is “did you HEALTHILY study?”! 

Did you take those breaks listed from earlier? Do you feel tired not from burnout and exhaustion but because you worked your brain to learn as efficiently as it could for the day? Did you get time in to talk to your friends or do something you love? 

If yes, continue repeating this system! Your health should not be less important than your work and studies.  


🔸🔸🔸


9: If not, reflect on what to avoid and 
change for next study session. 
There is ALWAYS a next time. 

🔹 Do not beat yourself up about mistakes or distractions, nobody is perfect and nobody is a machine. If you give up, you’ll never know what could have been if you tried long enough. 

Learning is like climbing a never ending mountain, you may not find the finish line but you also don’t realize how far you’ve come up until you look down. 


🔸🔸🔸

10: Tell yourself “Good job!” or that
you will do a better job tomorrow! 

🔹 Finish your reflection with some encouraging words.

Whether or not the day went good, whether or not it was your fault, you must stay determined because the only person that can promise you success is yourself.

languagelearning,Documenting my entire language learning journey month by month,"Hello language learning community of Reddit! I thought I'd write this post and update it every so often just to give people motivation if they are struggling with language learning or if they're interested in having a rough guide (if all is successful on my end) 

Background:
So I'm a Native English speaker from the UK, 19 years old and like most people in the English speaking world, always sucked at acquiring another language besides English. Of course I did spanish, French in school but I absolutely cannot speak them at all. Other than school I've also attempted to self-learn German but gave up after maybe 3 or 4 months (even though I made good progress with it, just burnt out and didn't have motivation anymore)
So around  two months ago I stumbled across various youtubers and got the language learning bug again. I learned about guys such as Steven krashen, khatz who created the AJATT/MIA method and matt vs Japan. I had this surge of motivation that overtook me so I decided to challenge myself. That even though I was full time military and didn't have huge amounts of free time that I would learn Japanese, no ifs or buts. I got interested in Japanese for the challenge of it, a language that was so different from my own and seeing guys like matt and khatz was a huge motivation for me that it was possible. So I'm learning Japanese and acquiring a second language properly, no ifs or buts... 

Month 1: beginning to build the foundations
So here's my first monthly update, so far I've gotten myself into a good routine (1 hour of active study a day with the rest being passive listening wherever I can) the resources I've been using have been YouTube channels like Japanese ammo with misa, and some other random videos here and there. Alongside that I've been using Memrise for some vocab and I've been building a sentence deck with Anki that I add to everyday and review when required. 
My spare time has been filled with watching Japanese series and listening to music and podcast, like 4 to 5 hours worth a day... I use Japanese subtitles to enhance reading comprehension. I don't understand much of anything but it's getting me used to how things sound and also I can pick out the sentence structure and recognise some words. So to conclude with month 1 and the progress so far. I'm completely comfortable with both Hiragana and Katakana, I know the basic grammar and sentence structure and can express basic ideas, such as wanting to go somewhere, asking people if they want to go places, make comments on the weather, ask questions about people's age and where they are from, and also answer those questions, I also know a lot of basic everyday expressions and know random vocabulary here and there and I'm already quite surprised at how quickly I'm picking things up! 

I'll write back next month with the next update!",1622461646,Rtas00,30

languagelearning,Planning on taking the DELE B2 exam. Tips on making a study schedule?,"Hi! 

sorry if this is in the wrong category, I posted it in resources because I’m looking for resources to help me reach my DELE goals. 

I’m planning on taking the DELE B2 exam, likely in the summer of 2023. 

I’ve been learning Spanish for 5 years now, and reached a B1 level, however for the last 2 years (since I graduated high school) I’ve been seriously slacking and my learning has been almost stagnant. I’m currently probably a beginning A2 level, and definitely not as good as I was. 

So, I do have to spend a lot of time reviewing and relearning content. I do also have to make the jump of learning from B1 to B2 anew. But, I have 2 years to do it. 

How would you recommend designing a study schedule or goals for studying?

Currently, it is my goal to completely redo the Duolingo Spanish tree without skipping any parts of it, just to freshen up on remembering vocabulary words and getting in the habit of studying again. I intend to be done with this by the end of August 2021 (3 months from now.) 

Is there anything that you would recommend next? I honestly don’t really have a clue other than purchasing some YA books and reading them and focusing on talking to native speakers, but I kind of also want to complete a designated course or book after finishing Duolingo, one that is a little more advanced.

languagelearning,How to learn to speak a language? Is spending on a good tutor of iTalki worthwhile?,"Hi! My name is Fede. I'm from Argentina, and I'm 19 years old.

I learned English at an advanced level through mostly immersion, which means that I spent a lot of time in English by listening or reading it.

One rule which MattVSJapan (who inspired me to go full-time immersion) teach me was not to force speaking because, before that, you need a high-level listening skill to learning it in the right way.

I need to learn to speak now. My professional career depends on that. So I have enough motivation to do 6 or 9 hours of study/practice every day.

I will read English Grammar In Use (book by Raymond Murphy) before starting my challenge of 3 months full-time. And in the meantime, I am collecting resources that would help to accomplish my goal.

I already listed as high-quality resources **Pimsleur**, good tutors on **iTalki**, **Shadowing** (a technique based on imitating a native English speaker), training pronunciation with **Anki**, and language exchange sites like **HelloTalk**, **Tandem**, or servers in **Discord**.

languagelearning,Recommended Best Way to Maintain (Regain) German Proficiency,"Long ago, I was quite proficient in German. I studied it in High School (late 80s) and then while a University student (90s) as part of my degree in National Security Studies. Thus, what I learned was above and beyond just learning a language at a conversational level -- I  also studied German history, art, literature, and culture. All in German-speaking classes at Uni.

After graduation, I went to Germany in my early 20s for several months and really got darn good at German. I had intended to live and work there -- but things changed and I took a different path.

But now, as decades have passed, I've lost the ability to keep up with slang and some of the informal parts of the language.  I've forgotten a lot of the business German I knew. And society has adopted a lot of new words into the language.

So ... All that out of the way ... What do you recommend to get myself snapped back into being better with my German?

I'm going to France in a month to wwoof (worldwide opportunities on organic farms) and work on a farm for 3 weeks. I've never been to a francophone country or immersed in native French speaking so I'm trying to self study a lot before going. I studied French for 9 years in high school and college (minored in college) but I had a 3 year French break when I lived abroad in another country.  During that time my speaking/listening skills really took the hardest hit, so I'm currently at an A2 level and hoping to get to a solid B1 before I leave.

Currently I have a French tutor once a week to get some speaking practice (non-native speaker but spent a lot of time in west Africa), but our lessons are pretty much whatever I want to work on but I struggle with what I should be practicing. I end up just trying to talk a lot about what I'm doing or retelling what I did over the week but also looking for advice on ways I could better be using that space. 

On my own I try to listen to the podcast journal en français facile everyday, but that's just 10 minutes. I have most streaming services so also looking for good recs for shows/movies that are recent and can give more modern french in France. I have some french music but that's mostly from west Africa. What are some good modern french music artists from France?

What else should I be doing? I wanna make the most of this time I have to improve but I'm struggling on where to start. I feel like after studying french so long in an academic way I get focused on grammar rules or isolated grammar lessons and struggle to apply it to just general French usage (especially things like compound tenses and various pronouns i.e dont, en, ce que, etc).  I  find that while I can generally express what I want to say in an elementary way, I often don't know anything about colloquial french phrases or how conversational French is. So just looking for general advice on good exercises or resources I should be using. Thank you!!!

languagelearning,How to learn to speak English? Is spending on a good tutor of iTalki worthwhile?,"Hi! My name is Fede. I'm from Argentina, and I have 19 years old. 

I learned English at an advanced level through mostly immersion, which means that I spent a lot of time in English by listening or reading it.

One rule which MattVSJapan (who inspired me to go full-time immersion) teach me was not to force speaking because, before that, you need a high-level listening skill to learning it in the right way.

I need to learn to speak now. My professional career depends on that. So I have enough motivation to do 6 or 9 hours of study/practice every day.

I will read English Grammar In Use (book by Raymond Murphy) before starting my challenge of 3 months full-time. And in the meantime, I am collecting resources that would help to accomplish my goal.

I already listed as high-quality resources **Pimsleur**, good tutors on **iTalki**, **Shadowing** (a technique based on imitating a native English speaker), training pronunciation with **Anki**, and language exchange sites like **HelloTalk**, **Tandem**, or servers in **Discord**. 

What do you think of my plan? Do you have any advice?

Thank you for reading this post. I would greatly appreciate your comment.

languagelearning,"So the question of semantics is that are improvised diplomatic statements , tactful or are they not."," 

so     from my understanding a improvised diplomatic statement that is     normally said amongst people is made up at the spot and said so neither     the speaker nor the listener gets offended/negatively impacted in any     way or form, the purpose of this is too make sure that relationship     between the parties is not hurt, sometimes it can even improve     relations.

Now the definition of     tactful or tact is "" having or showing skill and sensitivity in  dealing    with others or with difficult issues"" or "" careful not to say  or do    anything that could upset someone"" now as u can see it deals  with  people   (dealing with others) and things (i.e. difficult issues)  so  naturally   while diplomacy can only be carried out between people ,  it  makes   dealings that are made in a  diplomatic way, tactful.

hence     the answer to the question "" Are improvised diplomatic statements ,     tactful or not? "", in my opinion is yes, Improvised diplomatic     statements are tactful. Do you guys think this is correct ?",1622378247,Prohp3t,10

languagelearning,Can you suggest some great career options in the field of Languages (studying a foreign language)?,"Hello everyone,

I have this question in my mind for quite a long time now and since none of my family or friends have a clear idea about this field and its future, I wanted suggestions and advice from you all.

**A little overview of my academics and stuff :**

So basically I am quite fluent in English (which is included in our curriculum since nursery/kindergarten) and my mother tongue (Hindi). I also learned Sanskrit at school for 6 years but I can't really speak it as the course structure focused more on reading and writing rather than speaking. I won't completely blame the school or course since I never took it seriously, still find it a very beautiful language with a vast vocabulary. I was good at science and maths so I opted for it for my senior secondary education (XI-XII grade). I mostly did maintain my performance at school but found myself incompetent preparing for engineering entrance examinations, scored average in the first two attempts which won't be enough to land in a top or good university due to intense competition. I did study a lot in two years and excelled in my class (kinda isolated myself from various social media platforms, therefore I'm new to Reddit and discord) but still, the pattern differs so much that you need a separate coaching class and sheer determination to clear it. My elder brother and some of my friends did it and are in top colleges, which made me realize that maybe it was some sort of peer pressure that forced me into this.

As covid 19 cases spiked, my final exams and all entrances got postponed till the situation is under control. It is a really terrible time and I lost many acquaintances. I decided to stop my preparation and discover my interests and strengths for peace of mind. 

I love to explore music genres in various languages like Mandarin, Korean, Romanian, Arabic, Italian, and many more. I really wanted to learn Korean and Japanese since I was in middle school when I got introduced to K-pop, K-dramas, webtoons, and anime. Yet I never managed to make time during school to maintain my grades, but now that I wanted to refresh and give myself a break, I started learning Korean. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeginnerKorean/comments/nmto3x/one_month_of_korean_learning_journey/) is a short update on my 1 month of learning Korean. I am exploring other languages too and started preparing for the entrance of Bachelors in a foreign language. I am preparing with my full potential and a clear goal to achieve in my head. This actually motivates me to study for long hours without being frustrated like I used to get while preparing for my finals.

 Yet my parents and I are a little uncertain in changing fields, I hope you all understand my situation and provide some fruitful suggestions and advice.",1622360187,Kring_kim,6

I was in Spain before covid started and it was absolutely amazing. I had a conversation with a guy at McDonald's and it was the best feeling I've ever had, he also said I spoke Spanish very well for a teen that's never been outside of Canada. Anywho, I love both languages fairly the same. I mean French is an official language of my country and also I have very strong French roots. All of my ancestors are French, including my last name. 

Personal interest also play a big role in why I can't decide between French and Spanish. French is found in just about every major sport besides baseball. Whereas Spanish is in about every major sport besides hockey. I love both baseball and hockey.

I've been stuck on this for a while, and some of my friends are saying I'm overthinking it way to much and I should just learn french based on the things I'm talking about.

languagelearning,Which College Foreign Language?,"I'm going to be entering college this fall and am currently in the process of registering for classes. I need to figure out what foreign language to take for 2, possibly 3 semesters.

Background: I have been taking Spanish in school for the past 5 years. For the first 3 I learned absolutely nothing and then took up learning Spanish on my own and quickly became fairly proficient in the language. I'm by no means close to fluency but I might be B2. I took the AP Spanish test this year (Scored 1-5. If I get a 1-2 I don't get college credit. 3 = 1 Spanish course. 4 = 2 Spanish courses. 5 = 4 Spanish courses) but I am entirely sure that AT MOST I got a 3, so I'll have to take foreign language in college for 2 or 3 semesters.

I'm trying to figure out what to do and here are my options:

1. Take Spanish: The big problem with this is that I won't know my AP Score until July so I won't be able to sign up for Spanish in college until then (If I got college credit I'd be starting in a higher level class). The other issue is that I'd be learning very beginner stuff that I'm already familiar with whereas I just need practice and to use the language. I feel like it would just be a waste of my time, even if it's a free grade.
2. Mandarin: Would love to learn Mandarin and I have learned a little on my own. I just don't know how well it would lend itself to a classroom given that much of the language is just rote memorization rather than conjugation and complex grammar.
3. Something else (Y'all give me ideas)

(No it's not because of anime, the reason is even more 'weeb' than you think.)

My questions for the people that are already fluent (be it native speakers or someone else who learned, I'm interested in hearing from both)...


&gt; Would I be correct in assuming that unlike when I learned Spanish, my prior knowledge of Russian will be completely useless?
It seems to me that the grammatical structure is completely different than most other languages and I'd be pretty much on equal ground with someone who say just speaks English.

&gt; Another assumption I'm making is that writing and reading will be a challenge on it's own. Kenji seems like a very complicated format that will require a lot of memorization.
While I do wish to eventually achieve fluency, I consider learning to speak/listen a higher priority than writing/reading, and think it's generally easier to learn 'one thing at a time' than try to tackle everything at once. Would it be unwise to simply take all my notes in Romaji until I'm comfortable enough with the syntax and vocabulary to move on to the next step? Would I just be making it harder on myself in the long haul or is this a feasible plan?

&gt; I would also like advice on resources from someone that has successfully taught themselves. (I'm not willing to sign up for any classes. I wanna just be able to download something I can work with by myself on my own time.)
I was thinking Rosetta Stone but after doing a bit of research, the consensus seems to be that it's overall a good program but their teaching style is incompatible for this language structure.
Definitely would prefer something audio based but whatever gets the job done. And yes I am willing to pay for a quality product.


Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.",1622333567,1337letics,5

languagelearning,Is grammar unimportant?,"The more I think about this question, the more troubling it becomes. 

Take English grammar, for example.

English has only two verb tenses. But most people — most *native speakers —* don't know this. They believe there to be 3, or 12, or 32. Until a few days ago, I believed the same.

OK fine, who cares? After all, ""grammar is not important"", as the prophets say.

But on the other hand, take mathematics. 

Imagine your math teacher (or your child's math teacher) didn't know how to identify prime numbers. ""Prime numbers? Eh, who cares. They're not important."" Imagine that this teacher confused calculus and algebra in the same way that people (still) confuse English and Latin.

In 1921, an official report by the British government stated: 

&gt;If by 'English Grammar' be meant a *complete* description of the structure of the language with special attention to its *differences* from other languages, it is certainly far too early to attempt to teach it... What this structure is we are only now beginning to find out.

I’m 16 now and I have two years until I graduate. I want to study medicine and because of that I will be spending time in hospitals (not immediately but eventually it’ll be part of the course) talking to patients and a lot of native speakers, so not learning Italian isn’t a choice. All my lessons will be in English, but I’ll still need to speak the language. 
I’m planning to use apps during the summer to get a head start, but I’m worried it won’t be enough to learn enough in order to go to university there. 
Oh and I’d like to point out that English isn’t my first language, I’m a native Greek speaker.

languagelearning,You can use Google Translate for proofreading.,"Have you ever written a text but you aren't sure if it contains grammatical mistakes or not? Have you read a text written by a native speaker by you haven't understood the complicated words. You can use Google Translate in case you haven't known that yet.

Let's test the technique on this [nice comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nnj3w7/people_who_choose_to_be_kind_everyday_despite_of/gzuwts1?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) on a post of r/AskReddit:

The original comment:

&gt; I'm not especially strong or educated, I'm not particularly well off and I know I can get carried away and come off as annoying sometimes. So if I can't be strong or smart, socially adept or successful I can definitely be kind.

I copied it and translated it [into Chinese traditional](https://iili.io/B6u8I1.jpg), then I reversed the translation and this is what I got:

&gt; I am not particularly strong or educated, *nor am I* particularly *rich*. I know that I sometimes get *overwhelmed* and *become* annoying. *Therefore*, if I cannot be strong or smart, social or successful, I can definitely be kind.

As you see Google simplified the difficult words, replaced the phrasal verbs with easier verbs and changed syntactic structures. I see at the last sentence it removed a word that made a little of change in meaning.

Note: Google Is a robot and is prone to mistakes. You should not use this for proofreading your thesis.

Note 2: you can translate the text to any language (I prefer the ""advanced"" ones that Google has supported from the first days of Google Translate, French, Spanish and German) and you don't have to know the language.

Note 3: You can use this when learning any languages.

Note 4: I didn't use the technique when making this post. So God knows how many mistakes it may have.

languagelearning,Learning Russian with glossika (need help),"So I’m learning Russian right now like the title says. I did take one year of Russian in highschool 16 years ago, and refrained the letters of the alphabet and 5-20 words. I learned Spanish with Pimsluer and I’m using Pimsluer with Russian as well. I like the speaking out the get go approach. Trying to get enough vocab to start taking italki classes, probably in about a month. 

So I didn’t use glossika until I was already having conversations in Spanish for about a year. This was boring for me so I stopped but I liked the idea.

I’m wondering if I’m jumping into glossika too soon, I’m overwhelmed. They talk so fast, and sometimes I can’t even pronounce the word and I’m just listening. Then it says that the word is 100 percent in my memory and this is not the case. I still do plan on using Pimsluer every day, and I find Pimsleur much easier. I do know it takes time and trust the system, but wondering about study time, how you use glossika, or if I’m using it way too early. Anything you can tell me to help me use glossika to its full potential is greatly appreciated.",1622307965,Iweldthingsallday,5

FYI I'm taking German classes now, and during the listening time, we're supposed to write down the answer while finding the next answer. But even if I'm familiar with every word or grammar point, sometimes I'm not able to get a single answer, because for me it's almost impossible to put down what I've got in my brain and to concentrate on what they're saying at the same time, **even in my native language**. This case is so terrible that I can barely remember and understand anything while reading some texts myself.

I used to think that this skill is equipped by the majority of the population because most people around me won't even put special effort into it, some has never even noticed it. However, a few days ago, when I was walking down the road, I overheard someone saying that she couldn't remember what the teacher had said while taking notes either. Therefore I've been hypothesising that maybe it's not that common.

Sorry if I was digressing from language learning, and I chose to post this here mainly for my concern about the effects it'll have on the language tests and to know if there are quite a few people who have some related experiences that are worth sharing. **So...how hard is it for someone who's bad at this to acquire this skill?** For me, I've given some information about myself in the first paragraph.

languagelearning,Should I learn French. Yes I read the FAQ,"I am thinking of French but I am a bit on the fence and can use some sober second views.   
I am over 50, unilingual and don't work \[rentier\]  


Pro  
1: I am half Quebec French and it's always a shame not to know your ancestral languages especially if they are in common use.

2: Easy, a gentle introduction to the world of learning a language. \[Have other language interests\]  
2a: I live with my father who spent most of the 1930s and 1940s as a unilingual French speaker

2b: Spent 50 years in Canada with official bilingualism and my first 13 as an Anglo in Quebec \[where I failed French every second year when taught by a unilingual teacher. I have a bit of vocab, familiarity with the sounds and probably some long forgotten stuff from 40 years ago.  
2:c: I live close to Quebec in a small city some French. Library with French stuff. French TV stations, French radio.   


Non issues

Work: Don't care  


Cons. I don't really have any other reason to learn French. 

1: I have no connections to my Father''s side of the family none of whom speak English and no real interest to start now. I have no French friends and don't make friends easily.   
2: No real interest in the culture. Sure I could find something to watch and read for learning and maintenance however I have no real drive for it \[unlike for example Bollywood or Kdramas\].  
3:All the local French people in town speak fluent English and even when I was going into Montreal every few weeks it's amazing how you can get by with no French. Double plus so in the West Island. So the utility factor is pretty much none.   
4: I am still a bit sore about the language politics and growing up in a province where I knew my kind was not welcome.   
It seems a heavy time investment for a language that I want to know but have no actual need or use for.

I can understand the majority of what is said when listening to spoken content. My overall grasp on the core vocabulary is quite good, I would say; passive vocabulary, that is.

About a month ago I started taking iTalki lessons twice a week. When talking I generally don’t struggle with the grammar a lot but I have trouble remembering even basic vocabulary. This is of course expected. There is no way you can speak fluently from the beginning. What troubles me, though, is that I don’t think I’ve been improving over the course of these lessons. Both the amount of words and the type that I can’t remember remains the same.

languagelearning,Positives about learning a language aided by Coursera courses,"Just want to give some positive feedback on learning a language with Coursera! 

I recently did the intermediate 1 Korean course on there and I really enjoyed it. It takes up to 6 weeks/ 12 hours total. https://www.coursera.org/learn/korean-language-intermediate

I think as online free courses go, it’s very well laid out. I attend a Korean class already twice a week so I found it mainly helpful as just a different form of additional learning and would absolutely recommend it. There’s lots of repetition for reinforcement and overall it’s been a nice additional learning tool. 

It has a mix of videos, reading, practicing exercises, midway quizzes to see what you remember and if you understand and what you’ve learned. 


Just wanted to add my two cents as I’ve heard many mixed reviews on Coursera language classes and I think you get a good deal considering they are free. They’re not going to be your main form for learning but they certainly are a nice addition to just trying to decipher new grammar points by just reading a book or googling/YouTubing things. It also gives you structure if you’re not very good at learning by yourself(which I’m not!) 

For anyone interested, the university it is run by also do more Moocs on their own website(beginner and intermediate levels).

What made the difference is that I finally found my person. My teacher. My maestro. I finally feel comfortable and can completely let my hair down around her.

As such, I've had probably six hour-long speaking sessions in the past two weeks and, suddenly, I see the channel opening for me.

I get into the groove. Pienso en español. My brain just opens up to the feeling and the words flow. You just...talk...and the words magically start to awkwardly land out of your mouth and they're somehow 90% correct. 

Guys, seriously. Stick with it. The rush is insane.

Suddenly you're having really fine-grain, deep discussions about culture and life and humanity with people from an entirely new perspective simultaneously held next to your native perspective in an *entirely new language.*

The language both permits and allows you to dig into different nuances of meaning and feeling than you had ever thought of before. Instead of seeing things as road blocks, see them as invitations to understand new perspectives on how to defining meaning.

And when it clicks...it's SO FUN.

Remember: THIS IS ALL SUPPOSED TO BE FUN!!! That's the whole point! 

Seriously, though, its much easier to stay with it when you take the time to find the right teacher, the right content, the right routes to memory that make sense for you.

languagelearning,"Learning foreign script by writing, VS learning foreign script through flashcards","I feel like, in the language learning community, there is a consensus that flashcards are the best way to learn anything. However, I feel that when it comes to learning a foreign script, I think physically writing the script helps you remember it better than flashcards. 

I'm not an experienced language learner so I hesitate to express strong opinions on the subject, but I can't be the only one who feels this way. I spoke to an American friend who used to live in Korea, and they told me they tried and failed to memorize Korean script through flashcards for months, but after writing it by hand a few times memorizing it was never an issue again.

The reason I'm making this thread is, I feel like some people in the language learning community actively discourage writing script by hand. Particularly, the Japanese language community says you don't need to learn how to write Kanji, and they deride the Japanese school system for teaching students Kanji through writing, claiming it's inefficient and with modern technology you will never have to write it anyway. 

This applies to learning ANY script not just Japanese or Korean. I feel physically writing it is very helpful. It almost takes the work out of memorizing it, I can just mindlessly write it over and over again and let my muscle memory do the work. I really appreciate apps that allow you to practice writing the script, but most apps unfortunately don't do this.",1622227118,tesseracts,9

languagelearning,"My heart says Italian, but my brain says German. How did you pick what's gonna be your next language, what did you take in consideration? 😩","Okay so I've been learning Spanish for a while and I assume Italian is going to be way easier for me to learn next, but at the same time much more confusing that German. I love Italy, the culture, the country,the food and the people, and there's a chance I'm going to visit it way often than Germany or a German speaking country. I also have my dad who worked in Italy all his life(but he's kinda toxic so we don't talk) and his friends that I could maybe speak Italian to. I'd also love to communicate with locals when I visit.

BUT I'm still trying to decide where I'm going to move next in 2-3 years, Germany and Sweden are really high up the list. With Italian I'd only use it for communicating when I'm travelling. I'm still not sure tho, but I know I would be much more successful in business with German&amp;more countries speak the language and even for tutoring it's much better paid than Spanish or Italian. The thing is, idk when the opportunity to talk German will come, only if I move which idk yet 😭 and I'm not as passionate about it, maybe I just need to listen more to ""fall in love"". Idk what to do really, I love them both for different reasons.

languagelearning,Listening to songs in your TL when you start learning a new language is far better than watching movies,"Watching TV series/movies is often recommended as a great tool to get familiar with the sound/tone/rhythm of TL. But listening to songs is something that you should start with.

When you watch a movie, there are lots of background noise that doesn't let you focus on the language, often you just can't hear what's being said.

Songs, on the other hand, allow you to learn informal phrases, you'll get used to different paces of somebody's speech. They're relatively easy to learn by heart and you'll find yourself using larger portions of lyrics in your everyday conversations. When you sing along to a song, you improve your pronunciation (holds especially true for upbeat songs). You can even print the lyrics and work with your dictionary to find the words you don't know, but many sites attach translations in your native language.",1622195767,GrabApprehensive,7

languagelearning,Success! Progress! The joy of pirated YouTube documentaries!,"So I pretty recently posted on here of how sick I was of being at the intermediate level and how I wasn’t enjoying learning Spanish anymore. And today... I think I had a bit of a breakthrough (in two parts). 

The first: intensively reading is actually more fun for me rn than extensive reading? At first, pretty much the opposite was the case and I was genuinely just overjoyed that I could follow along with a story in Spanish. As an English major, I’ve been granted the ability to read things and enjoy them even if I don’t know half of what’s going on. I just realized that I started out reading Spanish p much the same way I read Shakespeare. Obviously trying to follow along, but mostly just enjoying what I do get and saving any deeper comprehension for later. Recently, for whatever reason, my mind has made the mental switch to try to read Narnia in Spanish the way that I normally would read Narnia or any other book in English. I was trying to follow along with every bit of the language and become fully immersed in all that the characters were going through. As I was reading Narnia in Spanish, this was very much not going to happen and I just ended up feeling tired and unable to focus. 

Intensively reading, however.... is genuinely just a joy for me? Like I actually really like the feeling of being able to ‘decode’ Spanish and reveal the full meaning of a sentence. So, as a result, I’ve been able to intensively read for two hours thus far today and I still feel as if I can do more. *And I’m having fun with Spanish again*. 

The second part was that... I haven’t actually been stalling as much as I thought I was and my listening comprehension has gone way up? Like I recently discovered the wonders of YouTube’s advanced filter and I randomly decided to look up ‘historia documentales’ with captions and?? I understood what was being said? I was even able to follow along with what was being said on a documentary on Ancient Rome with no captions and I struggle doing that in English lol (my NL). Wondering if it was some type of fluke, I went back to some documentaries on Netflix that I had struggled with before and? Nope! Still mostly getting it! Like it’s actually kind of weird, because I’ve hardly been doing any listening practice at all. In terms of input, it’s mostly just been reading. Just goes to show how much power Stephen Krashen has, I guess lmao. Free voluntary reading, indeed. 

Anyways, I’m just really happy with all of this and wanted to share lol. Hope everybody’s doing well with their progress!",1622155462,fourdotoh,3

languagelearning,Advice for going to a country that speaks your target language?,"Hello! I plan on going to Mexico in the near future. I can speak and understand enough spanish to consume some Spanish media, though stuff with slang throws me for a loop still. I still have a problem with the letter RR.  I can make the noise and as long as the r is in front of the word I can say it. But words like perro and carro are still difficult for me. I want to go on a studying binge so that I can handle myself and my friends in Mexico. (they don't speak it at all so I probably have to be the one to translate) I think having to actively use Spanish on a daily basis and picking up words and slang from native speakers will help me tremendously.

languagelearning,YouTube Polyglots,"I am rather cynical about these so called polyglots we see on YouTube. Don't get me wrong I really admire people who can speak multiple languages and hope to get to four myself and then be able to call myself a polyglot. But there are a few issues I have with these people, one is the seems to be a large dollop of narcissism involved. Hey everybody look at how great I am speaking 50 languages. Ok maybe I'm exaggerating a little as the most I have seen is someone claiming 25 languages. But, this is where my cynicism starts to creep in. I just feel like there is no way someone can speak like ten or more languages to a really high level. I'm talking to the level where you can have fairly deep conversations about politics perhaps or conversations that test some intellectual vocabulary like coherent' and 'hierarchy' and vocabulary of lesser used words that still fall under the everyday use banner like 'wheat', 'oats', 'nails', 'pins' 'screwdrivers' etc. I know that's a fairly random list but it's just to give the idea of a decent level of fluency if we are not lost for words when it comes to these things. 

I think it leads into a territory where they become Jack of all trades and masters of few. Maybe some of them have the gist where they can just pick them up and remember words after the first time they come across them. Like a savant or something. But after thinking about the time it takes the average person like me to acquire a new language and divide my time 'effectively' amongst the three I speak fluently and the two extra languages I am learning it leaves me very cynical about the possibility of being able to speak ten or more and call yourself fluent in all of them. 

There was this one video where this Dutch guy demonstrates his 'fluency' in twenty-odd languages but says virtually the same thing for the camera in all of them except the handful he actually speaks to a high level where he shows more in depth conversations. The ones where I got the impression he had them to maybe intermediate level he was saying basic things to tourists and followed by 'I practice with the tourists' followed by that cringe  laugh some of the self-proclaimed gurus do which demonstrates how great they are for having said a few short phrases in Mandarin. It just seems like such an exercise in self-backpatting narcissism. It's greta when you get the ones who refuse to talk back to them in their own language and just answer in English almost saying don't even bother lol and you can see their sugar pedestal evaporating from beneath them. 

The one advantage I see is that if people are sufficiently impressed then it might get them to want to learn a new language and promote the rewarding feeling that learning a language to a high level can give to us. 

Once I was on an interpreting assignment for a governmental body and there was another interpreter in the interpreter's waiting room who had like 5 languages all to interpreting level and the rest of us were understandably impressed. To me that guy was a true polyglot because I know the immense amount of work it took me to get my Spanish to interpreting standards. And I don't think he has any youTube videos where he's proclaiming how greta he is for it lol.",1622103731,urbana1,23

languagelearning,Are there (linguistic/grammatical) term(s) that I can use to efficiently explain how in Somali we have different forms of some To BE words depending on the context.,"I plan to help others learn Somali through English. Here are the examples I want terms to explain them with:

A little background and to help you understand my question, Somali doesn't use the present participle of to be (eg: he is being helpful). Also it is a gendered language, male and female. 

It uses: be, am, is, are, was, and were. 

However unlike English, there are times for example that am can take many forms depending on the context. 

Here we start the examples and question. . . 

If you walk up to a random person and just wanna say that you are happy or if you wanna answer the question ""are you happy?"" 

You say it one way: ""Waan faraxsanahay"" - I am happy. 

- 1. If asked if you are (insert concrete noun) (Mr.) X. 

1. Are you X?: ""I am X."" ""X ayaanahay."" Or: ""X baanahay."" 

- 2. if objecting to ""you are not X."" 
""I am X."" ""X waanahay.""



- 3. If asked who you are. Or 4. if you just wanna say/(tell someone) what you are without being asked. 

""Waxaanahay X."" ""X baanahay."" Or: ""X ayaanahay."" 
For this 3 and 4, as you can see, there are three ways to say it.

The languages, which the server and its channel focus on, include:

\- Polish and Kashubian 

\- Czech 

\- Slovak  

\- Lower Lusatian and Upper Lusatian

\- Russian  

\- Belarusian  

\- Ukrainian  and Rusyn

\- Finnish  

\- Estonian  

\- Turkish  

We're also planning to branch out to other languages of the region as well, depending on the user demand.  


How are we different from the other servers?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Simple rules***, including the ban on speaking English***, which means that the server is not about general conversations in English, but about actually learning the languages of the region.

2. We are not a server for all languages of the world, we focus on a specific region, so there is also a room for the less popular languages, unlike on the other servers, where such languages are put into the ""other"" channel.

2. Этот сервер не  является сервером для всех языков мира, мы сосредоточиваемся на определенном регионе, поэтому здесь есть место и для менее популярных языков, в отличии от других серверов, где такие языки просто скинуты в канал «другие».

I consider this language just a bleak means of communication for others to understand me (including this post).

I used to like English when I was younger, but I have learnt it through textbook exercises. They were very arid. I know just a few words from games/audiovisuals. I remember watching Lazy Town and wanting to have a diary in English, but I just couldn't make a single entry by myself. When I was in primary school Youtube was very young and *never* contributed to my learning. I had *huge* difficulties in some areas, the biggest being verb tenses and phrasals/idioms/any sort of expressions. *I still have them,* after so many years and techniques (including watching Youtube later). 

The weird thing was that English classes in middle and high school were still quite pleasurable. Except when I needed to answer. Because I had anxiety I couldn't make any presentation in front of the class (still can't now), even in my native language. I had (still have) goosebumps when I was put to answer. Still have a horrible accent. This ended with lack of speaking practice... 

In high school my class performance was very low generally and this gave me confidence because I was better. A false confidence. High school ended with an examination that tested all the things you can do in the language (reading comprehension, speaking, writing...) and I got some good qualifications (B1, B1, B2, B2, B2); *some of them were not objective.*

Now... college. The problems aggravated. With linguistics and tons of books to read per semester. At the moment, language practice is insane, with business and law vocab and all sorts of alien grammar. I entered English with the hope that it will solve some problems, being an important language. Nope. College in general dropped my self-esteem even more.

I don't need tips. They'll not work. The conclusion is: this language is not for everyone. Just like French, Spanish, Urdu, Thai, Swahili and so on. Don't underestimate a bad speaker/writer/whatever of English. Better listen to their story.  Sorry for the long post and for any mistakes.",1622060837,Bitter_Chemist,6

languagelearning,Tips for teaching yourself a second language without making detrimental mistakes?,"Hello r/languagelearning I hope this post is allowed, if not, please let me know so I can remove it.

I'm an English speaker looking to teach myself Japanese. I've started the Duolingo course for it, but I'm not sure what I should be doing beyond that. The only language that I know fluently is English, and I'd like to be fluent in Japanese, but since I am teaching it to myself, I fell like maybe that makes things more difficult? 

For those of you who have gone through the ordeal of teaching yourself a language, what helped you the most and what mistakes did you make? I'm afraid some of the ideas I have that I think would be helpful may cause more harm than good.

For example, one tip I hear a lot is to keep a journal in the language you are trying to learn, but I'm not sure how people do that. Do I use google translate and write the translation down, or is this counter-intuitive? Should I write most of the entries in English and slowly incorporate Japanese words as I learn them until I can eventually write an entire entry in Japanese? 

Again, I can only speak/read/write/etc. in English, and while I know basics of another language (Spanish), I'm not fluent enough to speak/whatever in anything that isn't English. I feel like I'm shooting in the dark here. Any help is appreciated.

languagelearning,Best Approaches to Study Any Language?,"Hello Everyone, 

I've been studying Italian for the past four weeks with a private teacher. We meet twice every week for a total of four hours. The remaining time I study grammar, vocabulary, and try to improve on my listening and reading comprehension. While I think my teacher is motivated and well prepared, I'm missing a more practical approach to language learning. While I understand that Italian grammar is crucial I'd be keen to focus more on speaking. Currently, most lessons focus on grammar in combination with assignments. The main challenge is that learning grammar without a constant focus on sentence building and structure is a recipe for acquiring siloed knowledge. 

I'm already bilingual and a more visual/practical learner. I was wondering if anyone of you had similar experiences. If so, how have you solved this problem? For example, can you recommend a language school, a book, or even an app to bridge that gap? 

PS: I found a great article on the Tim Ferriss blog: ""[How to learn any language in record time...](https://tim.blog/2014/07/16/how-to-learn-any-language-in-record-time-and-never-forget-it/)"". Maybe someone has additional insight on the outlined approach.

languagelearning,I Think I Was Misguided for Years About How To Learn A Second Language… The Importance of Comprehensible Input," Hi All, I have some thoughts and a corny analogy about language learning that I would like some thoughts on. A bit of a preference. I lived in Thailand for two years where I worked with locals and internationals alike. During my time there I picked up some Thai, but never got the point where I could hold meaningful conversations or consume the media in the target language. I was absolutely perplexed as to why I never got past the beginning stages of learning Thai despite being immersed in the culture for almost two years.

Also, I have been reading / listening to a lot of Dr. Stephen Krashen which totally blew my mind in regards to language learning so that is where a lot of the below insights came from.

To begin… Before I left for Thailand I had always liked studying languages. I dabbled a bit in Japanese/Chinese/French/Korean, but never really got anywhere with it. I was a devout disciple of a lot of the advice I read on the internet that said things like ""Speak from day one!"", ""Use HelloTalk to find Native Speakers"", ""You don't need to spend money on any classes"" etc. I was amazed by Youtubers who seemed to know multiple languages, and they almost always had videos like ""Me speaking \_\_\_\_ language after five days etc."" This led me to abhor the thought of learning language in school. I had an attitude of ""Language is not meant to be learnt in school. It is meant to be lived though real life experiences! Only then will you be able to learn the language. People are just wasting their money by going to a language school"".

All of that led me to the following conclusion*. Language learning is all about production*. If you can start to speak the language, then all of the rest will follow. You don’t need any boring classes or anything like that just get out there and start talking. Any problems you are having learning the language just means that you are too scared to talk. Besides whats the point of knowing the language if you cannot speak it!""

I followed that advice in Thailand, and it always ended the same way. I would strike up a conversation with a friendly ""Hello, how are you"". Where are you from?"". My conversation partner would respond and then would ask me a question. There were times I could understand what they asked, but 9/10 times I would understand nothing of what they said back to me, and as you can imagine the conversation would fizzle out pretty quickly. 

I would then think to myself, if only I knew more vocabulary, this situation would not happen again. So I would proceed to get my beginner dictionary and start memorizing words. I would set goals like ""I am going to memorize these 100 beginner words, then I'll be able to understand what is being said to me during a conversation with a native speaker."" I would spend a couple of agonizing hours memorizing the vocab, and then I would try a conversation again. No luck. The conversation would fizzle out at pretty much the same spot as before.

Well Ok…. perhaps I need to know more grammar. I would pour over a grammar book and learn about the structure of the language. I would memorize how to use the past tense etc. I would learn sentence connectors, memorize the counting quantifiers etc. I should be good now. I would try a conversation again… no luck.

Ok, perhaps I need to watch movies in the target language without subtitles. THEN I'll be able to speak with native speakers. I would pop on a movie, and the language would just sound like noise. I would get little from this. Same with music. ""What the heck"" I would say to myself, ""When I ask people how they learned English, a lot of them just said '*I learned from watching English movies/series/ Youtube.'* How is this not working for me""? 

I then came to the conclusion that learning languages was just not for me. I gave excuses like I am too introverted to strike up conversations, or that I didn’t really want to learn a language, but I simply liked the *idea* of knowing another language.

Years later, fast forward to now, I watched some lectures by Dr. Stephen Krashin that blew my mind. 

He  proposed a radical idea…. Language learning is all about comprehensible input. I'm simplifying a lot, but he states that the key to acquiring a language is to find material that is just a bit beyond your level and consume it. Given these new insights, upon revisiting the problems I came across years ago in Thailand, I have a few hypotheses about what I was doing wrong.

1. Speaking from day one is backwards. I should be consuming lots and lots of comprehensible input. Krashen states that its okay if you don’t say a word for months. You will be able to produce when you are ready. (Wow this is totally different than my mindset at the time. I would have thought of someone who did not speak from day one as lazy and naïve for wanting to learn in what I thought was a ""passive"" way).

2. I should not have expected to be able to understand and get anything out of movies/music I was listening to when I was still at a beginner level. This is a point I want to dwell on for a minute. When speakers of English as a second language say ""I learned English though YouTube/movies/music"", I took it as ""I learned English *ONLY* though Youtube…etc"". I discounted the fact that they may have had years of English in school which exposed them at some level to comprehensible input at a young age. Even if they had terrible English classes for say 12 years, it may have gotten them to the point where they could consume English media.

Point two is actually freeing when put in context with another point made by Krashen in one of his many lectures. To paraphrase he said something like: *The goal of the language teacher is to get the beginning student to the point where he/she can consume comprehensible input in the real world.* That point blew my mind. If only I had a couple of months of language instruction by a trained professional in my time leading up to going to Thailand, I would have been in a position where I could have used the real world (conversations with native speakers/movies/TV) to acquire more of the language. I was trying to gain insights from the real world too early!

I now propose the following analogy for second language acquisition. Its like a rocket ship on a mission to the Moon. The Moon can represent fluency in a second language. In the beginning, the rocket is on Earth, and its first step is to escape the Earth's atmosphere. To do that it needs a lot of fuel. If it does not have fuel, it will never be able to escape the atmosphere and get to the Moon. The fuel can be thought of as language class (school/private lessons/ etc.). You use language class as fuel to get to the point where you can escape ""the atmosphere"" (the confined structured world of the beginner learner) and consume the language and learn from the real world. Once you hit that point you can use the real world to sail gracefully towards fluency. *The critical takeaway is that schooling is actually important to language learning.*

Lots of points here (and I probably should have unpacked Krashen's thoughts a bit more), but alas, what are your guy's thoughts?

Thanks!

TLDR: Second language acquisition is mostly about input. Comprehensible input (coined by Dr. Stephen Krashen) is the key to acquiring language. The point of language classes is to get you to the point where you can use the real world to get comprehensible input.",1622049268,Economy_Wolf4392,194

I work in a dermatology office near an area with a large Spanish speaking population. I'm hoping to become good enough to schedule Spanish-only patients and translate for them during their appointment.

languagelearning,Studying a Language for 8 Hours in 1 Day,"It was a holiday in my country  on Monday and I decided to try doing a day of French immersion for 8 hours. This is to test if I can do this for a week or so this summer.

The plan I had intended is below. I was testing this to see if I could study this long without quitting and if I could study efficiently without my mind wandering. This is also cheaper than taking an immersion course at university plus I get to use the language more rather than waiting my turn to speak.

THE PLAN:

\- 0800: 30 Day record yourself challenge

\- 0830: Grammar

\- 0900: read book

\- 1000: write notes about book for tutor

\- 1100: conversation with tutor

&amp;#x200B;

\- 1300: read book

\- 1400: write notes for tutor

\- 1500: watch movie

\- 1600: conversation with tutor

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED:

In the end, I had a really interesting book that I had to return to the library so I only read that, made notes and had conversations with the tutors. I didn’t do any grammar or watch a movie. The graphic novel was captivating. That went quickly and efficiently for the morning and for the first hour and a bit in the afternoon but then I got tired and my mind wandered. 

DID IT WORK:

Yes. 

I was able to stay on track because I had to quickly read enough that I had something to talk about with the tutor. Also, I had to organize my thoughts quickly and produce some notes so that I again talk for an hour.  I think I do have to watch a movie in the afternoon to get through that sleepy period. Otherwise the day of immersion went well.  So this should work for 1 week in the summer. Breaking the day into halves where I have to produce something or be embarrassed is really motivating.  The day was tiring but not as much as I had expected. Going for a walk at lunch helped keep my energy up.

&amp;#x200B;

This self immersion using tutors is about 1/4 the cost of an immersion course at university plus I get to speak, read and write much more. I got a complement from my tutor at the end of the day that I spoke better than normal that day. Also the next day with another tutor, she said I spoke better than normally too.

WHY BOTHER:

I study from 1 to 2.5 hours per day. After my university immersion last summer, I had planned to do another 2 weeks of full time immersion on my own. I was lucky to get in 2 hours per day. Even on a rainy weekend, I will tell myself to spend half of the day studying, I will max out at about 2.5 hours if I am lucky. 1 hour if not. So doing this ""stunt"" worked.

languagelearning,Accent Advice from a Professional Accent Coach,"I wrote this as a comment on someone else's post, but I suspect a lot of people would find it helpful, so I am going to go ahead and give it its own post. Let me know if you have any questions about this!

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have worked as a professional accent coach for General American English for the past couple of years, so I feel pretty qualified to answer this question.

Let's start with the basics. Every language has its own unique inventory of sounds that it uses to build words. You learn how to pronounce these sounds accurately when you are a baby. That is why babies babble -- they are acquiring the sounds of their native language. Unfortunately for us language learners, people's ability to intuitively and accurately mimic new sounds diminishes with age. Accents, then, arise when you imprecisely produce the sounds of your target language. Usually that means you are substituting one sound for another, but occasionally it might mean that you are broadly correct but with minor imperfections in your articulation. You can imagine it is as if you are building a castle out of legos (saying words), but using the wrong colored legos (wrong sounds). 

How can you remedy this?

Well, in my experience it is enormously helpful to have a thorough grasp of phonetics. Students who know the difference between a fricative, an approximant, and a plosive, or who understand the concepts of place vs. manner of articulation, or who are well-versed in IPA (the International Phonetic Alphabet) are likely to make better, faster progress than their peers. So giving yourself a good theoretical foundation helps. It also helps to have someone who knows what they are doing walk you through how to pronounce the sounds -- they should give you clear, easily understandable instructions about what to do with your jaw, tongue, vocal cords, etc -- and provide on-the-spot corrections if at all possible. Of course, that usually means paying someone like me, and that is not a luxury most people have! 

Regardless of whether or not you have a teacher, to be successful in your studies, you need:

1. the ability to clearly hear subtle differences between sounds
2. the ability to replicate those sounds through trial and error
3. the ability to accurately judge your own sound production (a skill many people have difficulty with, in my experience) and apply your own corrections as needed

In my experience as a teacher, there is a tremendous amount of variation in terms of natural talent/ability. Some students advance at a breathtaking speed, while others struggle to make any progress at all. My advice based on this is to shoot for the stars, but be aware that it is luck of the draw how easy or difficult making progress ends up being for you.

You should also be aware that there tends to be a phenomenon of diminishing returns at play here. The closer you get to sounding like a native speaker, the finer and more subtle the corrections become that you need to make, and the harder it becomes to improve that last little bit. In line with this, accent *reduction* is generally a more achievable goal than accent *elimination*, which may end up requiring exponentially more effort and time.

Finally, **THE MOST IMPORTANT ADVICE** I have for you is: you *really, really* want to focus heavily on accurate sound production from the very earliest stages of your learning process. Trust me on this. A *lot* of students assume that they will simply *""develop a feel for it*"" with time, but that isn't how it works, really. You will carry bad pronunciation habits from your earliest study sessions with you for years -- forever, even -- if you don't actively go out of your way to correct them, and the longer you go without correcting them, the harder it becomes to do so. The phenomenon I am referring to here is known as *fossilization*, if you are curious. It is way, WAY easier to improve your accent in the earliest stages than it is ten years later when you are already fluent.",1621972307,JakeYashen,15
languagelearning,Should I learn Japanese or Dutch first?,"So.. I really want to learn both languages. I started learning Japanese about 3 years ago by going to a Japanese course. I couldn't really keep up/didn't have time to study un my free time so I didn't learn much except for reading and writing Kana. After not quite a year I quit the course and started studying on and off on my own. I don't know much Japanese still, I could not have a basic conversation. I am really into Japanese because I like the grammar and also the sound of it.
On the other hand there's Dutch. I've only studied it on duolingo for a bit so I also don't know anything really, but my motivation to learn it is that my grandma's family is Belgian. If I were to study Dutch I could talk to my mum in Dutch who is fluent (though she doesn't practice it often).
So yeah, I just wanted to ask what you think about it and maybe make my decision easier.
Btw, my native language is German which is kinda similar to Dutch. I also know a bit of French and I'm fluent in English (idk if that's relevant)

languagelearning,Discussion on immersion effects,"I am the OP of a thread a week ago:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/nenyy2/negative\_immersion\_effects/](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/nenyy2/negative_immersion_effects/)

It seems like the discussion had taken a wrong turn somewhere, it is not my intention to steer into some form of political or cultural debate in terms of Chinese dialect/accents, and we didn't progress on the actual discussion I was hoping to better explore with the collective expertise in the forum here.

I am not sure how to better articulate this, but perhaps I can ask in a different context: If there are different subtypes of a language, and we are looking to improve the immersion environment to focus on the a a relatively more common dialect/accent on a global scale, is there any recommendation on the approaches?

If I were to draw other parallels perhaps it could be helpful to consider non-Chinese languages and discuss in those context as well? Suppose I am a Argentinean family trying to help the child learn accurate Castilian in terms of pronunciation and tone? Or perhaps I am a trying to educate the child in Brazilian Portuguese's custom and idiom  but living in Portugal where everyone speaks European Portuguese? Or living in Malaysia where people around speaks Malaysian Standard English but hoping to help the young child speak American English?

Now the question is, German or Spanish? I've heard that German has some very similar traits to latin (using nominative, accusative, dative, ...) and I'd just like to add that... I hated latin. I'm so sorry- i took latin classes for two years and i quit afterwards. My worst enemy was using subjective articles. But on the other side, because dutch is my native language it might help me with German.

Spanish seems to be a good idea here as well since i have some experience in french. however one thing i also kind of hate is the masculine or feminine part of a word.

languagelearning,How to start to listen and speak with a level of fluency in French and jump from intermediate to upper intermediate or advanced/proficient,"I've taken 3 years of French in high school, based on writing and reading I'm a B1 to MAYBE B2 but when hearing naturally spoken French my comprehension kind of tanks. You have to say it REALLY slow for my brain to really process it, best I can do is pick words out and make a guess. Also I have a pretty decent vocabulary HOWEVER I've just commonly was never able to remember some basic words and their definitions like ""chaque"", ""chez"", ""dernier"", etc. so if I don't look up the definitions of some basic words when I'm reading I'll have to guess and it could easily lead to me being lost. But back to my main point I really struggle with listening to French being spoken naturally (even sorta slow), and my guess to fix that is listen to conversations, movies/tv, and podcasts etc. Although I'll want to choose the most genuine sounding, people in tv don't talk how people IRL do. I feel like if I do this I shouldn't use subtitles because then I'd get to focused on trying to read the words to find out what's being said but idk maybe it's a better idea to use subs, that'd be good to know. I'm not bad at following what's being said if I have the text being read in front of me.

What I think will be hard is trying to talk naturally and at a fluid pace. When I read stuff aloud it's not that bad, my pronunciation is good enough etc. I feel the main issue is coming up with words I want to say in a conversation while I'm already going, if you get me. That and I'm not very expressive when I talk. Basically my problem is less saying the things outright and more fishing for the sentence construction in my brain. Of course my reading aloud isn't fluid either.

And one thing I really want to do but I just can't fathom how to do it in French: Getting to just think in French without translating everything into English. It's just... idk, I feel like to think in French I need to be more advanced in the language, but it seems to be more advanced in it I'd need to think in French... and to start thinking in French I'd need to translate the basic thinking at first... Even thinking simple things like ""Je pense que le definition de ce mot est un homme qui mange les banans faire d'amour"" (random sentence I just threw together as an example) would probably require me to think about each individual phrase.

I've also started learning Spanish recently, so this may apply too. Although I think my main concern would be vocabulary and making my voice faster and more easily expressive, and understanding fast speech",1621917526,DeviantLuna,6

Backstory consists of three points: My native language is English. I have been learning Mandarin for the past 6 months and have passed HSK-1 and HSK-2.  I am visiting Thailand in September and am planning to learn some Thai for my trip.

&amp;#x200B;

Plan: In order for me to continue learning Mandarin and to start learning Thai, I will be attempting to teach myself Thai from Mandarin this summer. Rather than teaching myself Thai from English. I recognize that this will less effective in terms of time usage, however, I feel like that extra time will somehow convert to more focused learning. This means I will be using Thai textbooks that are meant for Native Chinese speakers and I will use study tools for Thai that are only translated into Mandarin. Keep in mind, I will be teaching myself Mandarin from English throughout the summer. This means that I will spend half of my time learning Intermediate Mandarin from English, and the other half learning Introductory Thai from Mandarin.

How do you go about finding someone to model your language after? I know sentence mining, mirroring tone/gestures, and generally learning from a person who resembles you is generally helpful.

Do you test people out?

Do you have a habit, or track your shadowing in any way?

How do you find someone who makes you think ""oh that's me""?

Background: I'm a gay man so I don't speak much like cishet men, and even though I'm in my 30s I tend to use (my native) English like I'm younger because most of my coworkers are straight out of uni. So I almost never see anyone in any of my target languages and see myself.

I'm trying to learn Italian and, of course, have done some duolingo exercises, but I'm craving a more structured approach.

languagelearning,Why did you fail at learning a language?,"Hi everyone. I'm JB.  I'm French and I live in the South of France. 

My family's planning a trip to Thailand next year. I've visited Thailand before but never got to speak the language. This time, I'm planning to be fluent by the time I get there. 

Today, I would like to start in the best conditions. For this,  I'd like to share my experience in language learning and in particular,  explain the reasons why I failed at speaking some of the languages I studied in the past. 

As many people, I started to learn languages when I was in middle school. I've developed a real passion for them and I've come to learn many of them up to a fluent level, like Spanish and Hebrew. 

For other languages, I simply never went beyond a very basic level of conversation. 

I never really understood the reasons of my failure and it's been bothering me recently. How come that after spending so much time learning, I still couldn't have a proper conversation with someone. So I gave it a good thought to try and find solutions to this bad experience. 

Comparing my past experience and my success with other languages, here are the main differences I found that kept me from speaking Thai. 


	1. I never made Thosr language part of my life

Unfortunately, learning a language without speaking or using it is like trying to learn how to ride a bike by watching others do it. Although you can get the logic behind it, you'll never know how to ride a bike until you actually get on one, fall down a few times and train regularly until you've mastered the technique. 

The same goes with languages. If you keep learning it in a book, you'll understand how it works but won't ever speak it. 

When I was studying Hebrew for example, I tried to meet native speakers straight away. I went to a local cultural centre where I met amazing people who put me on tracks. Then I used language exchange apps to meet even more native speakers who became friends and with whom speaking was always a huge pleasure. I also read a lot about Israel and the Jewish culture which were completely unkonwn to me, tried to watch series with my friends to build a common cultural background with them. I dived into a whole new world in Hebrew only. 

In addition to words and grammar rules, I added feelings and good time to my learning journey and this made Hebrew matter and made me ask for more. 

I never did this with the languages I failed at.  It was never more than words and grammar rules and that's probably the reason why I gave up quickly. 

So here's my first thought :  for Thai, I should make it part of my life from day one. Make it matter, make it personal, have some feelings involved if possible, or at least create a warm and pleasant environment around it from day 1. The languages that we learn are meant to help us communicate with other people and not to be learnt secretly and never used. 


	2. I wasn't regular

The second mistake I made was to lack consistency while studying. Although I would study every day at the begining, I progressively stopped being as active as I should have been and started to learn less and less. Every second day at first, then at the weekend only, once a month and eventually I'd totally give up on Thai and start doing other things. 

Unfortunately, although there are a few shortcuts when learning a language, we still don't have a supercomputer that can upload a whole language into our brain so we can use it straight away. So when we study a language, we have to be consistent and go for the long run. 

This is something that's easier said than done. I work a lot. I have a family, a social life, I try to do sport every now and then and now, I'm starting Thai. But I'm ready to make the effort. 

Learning a language is like trying to fill up a funnel. At the beginning, a few spoonfuls are enough to fill the base.  However, the small quantity that you've poured in at the beginining is also likely to flow out of the funnel quite quickly : it's very easy to forget new concepts. That's why you have to pour in more and more knowledge at a pace that's higher than what you forget. 

Consistency really is a major key to successful language learning. Learning a language is a never-ending process. You keep learning and forgetting. But the best way not to forget is to use your language skills as often as possible in the contexts that are most relevant to your needs.


	3. I didn't use the right resources. 

In addition to both reasons I've just written about, there's one more element I should mention which is that I didn't use the right resources. 

Same as many people, and even as a young language teacher, I was convinced that finishing a language book would be enough to make me fluent. 

Unfortunately, that's not the case.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that language books aren't useful. What I'm saying is that they're not enough. 

The main advantage of language books is that they're designed for students. They can help you understand the grammar, make you focus on the most frequent words and give you tons of cultural tips. 

However, the main drawback of language books is also that they are designed for students. They use a simplified version of the language that's generally spoken more slowly than native speakers. Furhtermore, native speakers are generally more flexible with their language than its grammar. 

Therefore, if you never communicate with native speakers or work on resources that native speakers use, you'll never get used to the fast-spoken and colloquial versions of the language that is generally used among native speakers. 

So the last thing I'll try to apply this time is the following.  As I'm planning to reach a fluent level of Thai, I'll walk the extra mile and start working on native resources as soon as possible.

With all this in mind, I'm ready to start learning. I'll be studying for 30 minutes every day and use Sundays to plan my study sessions for the whole week.

Is there an efficient way to memorize words? I guess it depends on the language.

I had done the same for years, even with English, French and other Western languages.

languagelearning,Why does the FSI put group 3 languages together?,"https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/

It seems to me (I'm not a language teacher and I'm not particularly experienced with these) that these languages cover a massive range of difficulty. For instance: on one end, there is Icelandic, a Germanic language with some unusual grammar and tricky pronunciation. On the other end of the scale there are agglutinative languages with a ton of cases like Georgian, Hungarian, or Mongolian. 

If you look at the 'distance' between the groups, it seems that group 3 really *is* massive. Group 2 is a 16 to 33% increase in time compared to group 1, group 3 is a 22% increase on time on group 2, but group 4 is double group 3. 

So what is the reasoning behind putting Georgian next to Icelandic? I would expect Georgian to be not much easier than Arabic and Icelandic to be a bit harder than German, but nowhere near as difficult as Turkish. Group 3 is also by far the biggest in terms of the number of languages they put in there, so is it simply 'everything that is hard plus everything we haven't got round to yet'?",1621799816,I_love_maltesers,25

You would think this would mean I would be happy, motivated, proud of myself etc etc. Nope! Instead…. I am full of fury at the Spanish language. I’m just… sick of her. 

It’s been building up for a bit but it reached its peak when I was trying to review the subjunctive. I was pissed. Just growing more bothered by the second. I started reading in Spanish semi-recently, which I attribute the bulk of my progress to, and instead of just enjoying the story like I was in the beginning, I’m just getting more and more annoyed at the words I don’t understand. 

Before, I used to quit mostly because of self hatred and shame out of not knowing the language already and feeling like I wasn’t improving but now that I'm making progress… I’m just sick of it? Not sure how relatable this analogy is but it's starting to feel like the Spanish language is a 10 page paper and I'm at the conclusion with no idea how to wrap it up. It's like I can sort of see the end and sense the possibility of where I can be and it's driving me insane that it hasn't happened yet. 

I don’t want to give up again and I truly do want to improve but I don’t want to try to brute force my way through this and end up just completely hating Spanish.

languagelearning,How to improve your listening with intensive listening,"This method is the Uncle Siu's method. I learned this method from [this video](https://youtu.be/FGo_lm4l_yA). [This video with Chinese subtitles.](https://youtu.be/kWY2jY4oXBk). If you agree with his method, could you also translate it into English? Thanks! 

This is [the English of the guy who created this method.](https://youtu.be/xtxkvEBQVhg).

This could be intensive listening that you do for 30 minutes a day or so. Eventually, it will merge with normal freeflow immersion.


1. **Listen with the subtitles off.** If you keep turning the subtitles on, you are only reading the subtitles, not listening. You will not notice how native speakers contract, reduce and link words. Sometimes the speaker is only using very simple words, but you still don't understand it. The reason is that native speakers contract, reduce and link words. The problem is not with understanding (lacking of vocabulary), it's literally with listening.

2. When you don't understand something, stop it, replay it until you can understand it. Replay it for at least 20 times. 20 times? You guys probably think I'm crazy. But It's inefficient only at the beginning. It's like looking up words in a  dictionary. At first, you have to look up every word. Then, you look up less and less words. (The creator of this method actually replayed the audio for 60-70 times when he didn't understand something. 20 is just a number I made up, It can be 10, 20 or 100 times as you like.) The sounds you learn in a single sentence can actually be applied to other sentences. For example, when you learn the sound of /zb/, It can be applied to ""There's been"", ""was born"", ""This is Ben"" and ""his brother"". ""To""/tuː/ is usually reduced to /tə/, ""I would"" is contracted to /aɪ əd/ and ""could have been""/kʊd hæv biːn/ is contracted to /kədəvbɪn/, **If you are able to listen to these kinds of features in a sentence for the first time, you will also be able listen to them in different sentences the next time.""**

3. If you still don't understand it after replaying for at least 20 times. Turn on the subtitles. Find out why you don't understand it. For example, the speaker reduces some sounds to /ə/.

4. The most important step: Turn off the subtitles again. Keeping replaying the audio until you can understand it.",1621780555,learningenglishnow,66

languagelearning,Studying similar languages when you have experience with one?,"I apologize for a rambly post in advance.


I studied Portuguese last summer for a few months, reaching a maybe-B1 level. After that I went back to doing Spanish in school and stopped learning Portuguese actively, still doing some passive things with it here and there. Needless to say, it’s hella rusty right now.

I’m a few weeks away from apoint where I’ll be able to get back into my language stuff. I had a clear plan for the next year, get Portuguese and then Spanish to a good level(B1 or 2 at least), then move on to a new language, likely Russian.

I had promised myself I wouldn’t learn new languages before that goal...but then yesterday happened. I was watching Eurovision like many others and absolutely fell in love with France’s song. Aaaaaaand well...now I’m itching to learn French.

How dumb, on a scale of 1-10, would it be if I continued with Portuguese and started French along with it? I’m and audiovisual/auditory learner so I figured the languages do sound quite different despite being in the same language family.

Should I just stick to my original plan of Portuguese and Spanish first, and only then move on to a new language, like French?

An extra question:

Is it going to be hard or easy to learn Romance languages one after the other? My current list of new languages I’ll be learning is:
French 
Russian
Italian
Catalan
Romanian(?)
In some sort of order, French being first.

languagelearning,How do Bantu languages (Shona in particular) work?,"When I learn a language, I like to not only speak and study individual pieces of grammar but try to get some basic intuition for how the language works on a higher level.

Eg as an English speaker learning Spanish, if your mindset is to constantly convert English to Spanish in your head, you will progress slower and your Spanish will be unidiomatic. To truly understand how Spanish works, it's critical to realize that, compared to English, in Spanish there is a much stronger reliance on verbs being conjugated to contain information that has to be communicated through other means in English. There's also word classes (el and la) which verbs and adjectives have to agree with.

Reading about Bantu languages, there's a lot of talk about how they have lots of word classes, eg Shona having 21 mupanda. But do eg verbs and adjectives have to be conjugated to agree with the mupanda? Eg in Spanish el chico lindo vs la chica linda

Or are the mupanda literally just categories of things that don't really affect the rest of the sentence eg in German der schöne Mann vs die schöne Frau (junge being a der word and frau being a die word not really affecting the rest of the sentence)

languagelearning,question about Glossika as a beginner,"I've recently started using Glossika for a few languages. Is it just me or do they throw in some quite difficult sentences even in the beginning? 

I understand the set of sentences is common across all languages on the platform (which is something I'm not too fond of—with Thai, I can sometimes notice when a sentence is slightly unnatural, and sometimes there are inconsistencies in the way similar sentences were translated from English), but I feel like I get hit with some crazy TL sentences that I have no hope of repeating in the time given, even reading the phonetic guide, and then the next batch might be super simple ones that I can say with no effort.

Like with Thai, I might get

* *pen khon thîi nǎi* (""Where do you come from?""), then suddenly
* *láeeo cà mii rót-fai ùuen thîi cà pai sîiang-hái ìik chûuang toon nǎi khá* (""Is there another train to Shanghai soon?""), but retaining/shadowing more than like 10 syllables at a time at speed is overload for me in Thai/Vietnamese... and then back to
* *wan níi róon* (""It's hot today"")

Besides witnessing proof of Glossika's effectiveness in a friend with truly impressive Vietnamese skills, the other thing that drew me to the platform is that it's one of the few sources of substantial content for rarely-learned languages I'm interested in like Georgian and Kazakh. However, I feel like the progression of sentence batches within a level (A1, A2, etc.) could be more linear, not just in terms of grammatical complexity, but also length or perhaps syllabic density. 

Georgian and Kazakh pronunciation is so difficult that I feel I'd need a 25% speed option 😅Meanwhile, I actually feel like I'm making the most progress with Russian because I can successfully repeat the phrases with pretty good pronunciation (for a beginner).

languagelearning,I can't speak my father's tongue and that distresses me,"I'm 20 years old who was born and raised in Germany. My father never bothered to teach me croatian when I was a kid, although I spend a lot of time with my croatian relatives. My parents only spoke german to me so I was raised monolingual.

When I became a teenager, I started to learn english and I learnt it every day by reading english comments/articles/etc. on the internet. I still can't speak it fluently though. 

There were some instances in my life where I tried to learn croatian and then I gave up on it. I feel a lot of emotional pain because I consider it a waste of potential and because it's part of my identity. If I was raised bilingual, I would have less problems learning english or any other language for that matter. 

I feel like I'll never be able to speak croatian fluently because I was raised monolingual. I know that's a negative habit of mine to say ""if, could, would"", to stuck in the past. 

Despite my circumstances, can I still learn croatian and speak it as if I was raised with it? I am very good in pronouncing croatian words and sentences, even better than pronouncing english which is pretty weird.

languagelearning,What do you think about Duolingo?,"If any of you guys have ever used Duolingo to learn the basics of whatever language you chose, did you guys find it useful?

I've been using French Duolingo to learn Italian, and it seems quite an easy language to grasp on the initial levels. But I feel as though I'm not actually learning that much. Duolingo's method consists of repetition, which means I'll be hearing, reading, writing or translating almost the same content for quite the length of time, before I can move forward to new vocabulary.

Duolingo, unlike Babbel, does not use entire plausible dialogues with us in order to teach us how to use the language in a daily basis, but sole statements, in order to teach us vocabulary, plurals, articles, new verbs, and so on. 

Also, it becomes quite boring as time passes to keep doing the same thing again and again, until you finish the five lessons of that subject and then finally moves forward to the next one.

On the other hand, Duolingo is free, and it allows me to take lots of courses at once - Babbel is paid, and I got to choose one language and go with it until the end. 

So, any thoughts about it, guys? Has Duolingo helped you? Or has it proven itself a waste of time at the end?",1621728191,Admirable-Suit5387,32

It's really often the case that an archaic/literary/etc word is a direct borrowing from latin, with predictable modifications (e.g aeger -&gt; aegrum -&gt; egru -&gt; egro). I was wondering if it would be worth it to learn these archaic words, even if they're not used much anymore or at all?

languagelearning,It’s totally okay if you have an accent,"Hi! 
I’m not going to speak for everyone, just my own experience.

English is not my native language and since I’ve started learning it ""professionally"" I was always told that I need to speak as a native speaker. 

My teachers would always correct me and force to repeat the same word over and over again, until It sounded similar to the ""original"". 
My friends would also make fun of the way I speak and because of that I was ashamed of my own accent. I was chasing the ""perfection"" and it mentally broke me. 

Recently I fell in love with how English sounds from Chinese/Japanese people. To me it sounds so sweet and soft. That’s when I found “my accent"" 

What people tend to forget is that: accent is our background, it just shows our origin. I find it so fascinating that we can bring something new to the table and find people whom share love for the language. 

Personally I don’t think that accent is Illiteracy. Never be ashamed of the way you sound. Be proud of who are you, learn step by step and success will come to you. 

It’s totally fine if you want to sound native. Anyone can learn any accent they like.

i have personally created a word list with all pimsleur phrases and oxford 3000 word list which can be imported into anki with audio transcription linked below- please copy and use for your own use thank you 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G6JvQKRVpl4elcm6gj1kgYVzD\_UGpRi6BpvznXyQj5w/edit?usp=sharing

Good afternoon, I wanted to provide a google sheets resource I created openly which I feel will help the community  and I hope this can be pinned and shared

I have collected the oxford 3000 most common English words and separated them into lists based on word class

I have also used my pimsleur notes and collected all the main English phrases used in Italian 1-5 excluding all bonus words, exercises and conversations. (I have linked a more detailed explanation on this at the end)

Based off =iferror(GOOGLETRANSLATE(A1,""en"",”it”)) these lists have been google translated in column B

You can change the language translated to by finding the 2 letter code: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_ISO\_639-2\_codes

and replacing sheet 1 b1

Bear in mind that google translations may not be the most accurate but it’s a hella great start- if you want to bake the translations copy the column and paste values only.

You can organise your lists in alphabetical order by highlighting all and going to  data-sort range- a-z or z-a by column A or B

The oxford 3000 also labels each word by CEFR label, I have also included this so you can organise the sheet by cefr level if you want by sorting data range by column D a-z or z-a like the above

Once you have translated your lists- you can then download each list from google sheets as “tab-separated values (.tsv current sheet) and import into anki desktop. 

Once in anki I have used awesometts to convert text to speech and embed the audio into the cards

I use (oddcast/en simon) for English and (oddcast/it Roberto) for Italian

For those who think 3000 words is too much please note that lists 1-8 contain only 10-60 words per list which in total comes in at less than 500 words whilst the remaining 3000 words are split almost evenly between nouns and verbs

List 11-Pimsleur Phrases

list 10- nouns

list 9- verbs

list 8- pronouns

list 7- prepositions

list 6- determiners

list 5- numbers

list 4- conjunctions

list 3- exclamations

list 2- modal verbs

list 1- auxillarys, definites ordinals, indefinites

note that I have not included pimsleur translations – I don’t have time to do every language, 

I used the Italian course to get all the phrases – so there are Italian specific words, foods, places in the list- apart from this, from what I understand Pimsleur uses the same phrases across all courses and changes these specific words. So I wouldn’t worry too much. If you are wanting the pimsleur translations it’s a mildly laborious process. But you should note the following

the cards in each level category are unique i.e. level 1 general phrases are different to level 2 general phrases as is level 3-5. So you cant just skip to level 5 and copy all the cards because you will miss all the cards from levels 1-4

However annoyingly cards are duplicated between level categories e.g. “I want a bottle of wine” will be repeated in the category food, numbers, shopping. This is the reason why I created this list. Don’t worry about it

Copy all cards into excel column a with the English in column a and target language in column B – remove duplicate cards using:

=unique(A1:B2000)

This will remove all duplicate cards

languagelearning,Reflections on being bad-fluent,"I always kind of thought that fluency in a language was kind of an on-off switch thing. Kind of like when you figure out a puzzle or a math problem and everything falls into place and makes sense. 

That’s probably because before I came to the Netherlands, I hadn’t interacted with a lot of adult language learners. All of the bilingual people I knew had a head start as a child. So I’ve known a lot of people with English as a second language, but pretty much no one who started from scratch as an adult.

At this point, I speak more Dutch than English. And I’m not translating in my head anymore. I dream in Dutch, I think in Dutch. By all definitions I’m fluent.

But it’s not like I thought it would be. I’m not “fluent in Dutch” I’m fluent in *bad* Dutch. I speak bad Dutch fluently. I think in bad Dutch. In my dreams I’m not having coffee with the prime minister, I’m standing naked in front of my language learning class struggling to speak Dutch and everyone is laughing at me.

The language is effortless but produced in a bad way that probably makes native speakers cringe a lot.

I’ve realized it’ll never switch for me. I’m not going to one day be like “ah ha!” And suddenly I speak good Dutch. Like speaking *well*...that’s something you have to fucking grow into. 

Idk...I’m simultaneously proud that the language doesn’t take a lot of effort for me anymore and discouraged because this is a much longer road than I ever thought it would be.",1621679263,SweetPickleRelish,99

In information theory, and thanks to concepts such as entropy or Shannon's theorems, we can speak about things like how much an information source can be compressed without loss of information, and how much information can be carried over a communication channel.

Going back to languages, each language has its own ""redundancy"", which allows for understanding even if some phonemes are lost/misheard when communication happens over a noisy channel.

As an italian studying chinese, I'm quite sure that italian is far more ""redundant"" than chinese e.g. native italian speakers would have higher chances to have a communication (i.e. to understand each other) over a noisy channel than chinese native speakers over the same channel, given that italian has a lot of long words, while chinese has mostly disyllabic words (not even need to mention *the tone* stuff). One may argue that, speaking at the same ""speed"", chinese typically conveys much more information than italian, so given a noisy channel the chinese would just speak more slowly than italians, yet convey the same amount of information.

I wanted to share my experience, progress, what I'm hoping to accomplish next, and also get any suggestions from people here! For some background, I grew up in a Spanish-speaking family/community, and took Spanish in high school for a year or two but did not take it seriously. Overall, I feel like I'm making great progress and am more motivated than ever!

**Online Course**

In one month, I've completed 2/5 of the Basic Spanish courses offered by Coursera and I'm currently on the last part of the third course. I've gained over 500 vocabulary words (nouns, adjectives, verbs, expressions) from just this set of courses and I feel pretty comfortable with recalling most of these words. I spend probably anywhere between 30-45 minutes per day working through the course. 

**Apps**

The two apps I use are Babbel and Anki, and I use them both on my desktop. For Babbel, I spent around 15-20 minutes a day on it and I see it as a good review to what I've already learned on Coursera. Plus, I get a lot of speaking practice using it. For Anki, I spend around 5-15 minutes depending on how many cards I have to review that day. I transfer all the vocabulary I've learned from my course to Anki.

**Input/Output**

Input/output has definitely been my weakest spot. I listen to Babbel's beginner podcast once a day (they have both a bilingual and monolingual version of each episode, it's a little slow but useful for beginners!), watch Youtube channels like Spanish After Hours and Why Not Spanish every other day, listen to Spanish music passively. I also am in several bilingual group texts and I text in those groups everyday.

**Thoughts/Next Steps**

Overall I'm pretty happy with my progress! I would probably put myself at a high A1/low A2, and my goal was to be B1 in 4-6 months. I see now that it's more likely for me to get to B1 in 6 months, but I'll really need to amp up my input/output. I'm hoping to utilize Babbel's new live classes (I think I get two classes per month with my subscription), set up weekly Spanish-only sessions with my bilingual friends, and buy a Spanish YA novel that I've read before in English. I also need to do better with grammar (especially direct and indirect objects, that has me confused half the time lol). I know this post is more just talking about my experience than asking a question/advice/offering a prompt, but I just wanted to share somewhere and I also would love any advice with integrating more input/output in my life :) Excited for what the next month and the months after will look like!",1621618723,dreamraising,4

You're opened up to whole new worlds of culture and friendship but taking the first steps to speak a new language can often paralyze people.

""Many people cite learning a new language as an essential project, a dream that matters to them. But they never practice because they are embarrassed.

They want to be flawless—or at least not make fools of themselves—from the start. But a friend of mine who teaches Spanish sees it differently. As an exceptional student himself (with a JD from Stanford Law School followed by a doctorate from Princeton as well), he has learned that when it comes to languages, embracing mistakes leads to accelerated learning.

He teaches his language students to imagine they have a bag full of one thousand beads. Every time they make a mistake talking to someone else in the language they take out one bead. When the bag is empty they will have achieved level 1 mastery. The faster they make those mistakes, the faster they will progress.

languagelearning,Should non-binary pronouns and forms be allowed if it's not something approved by the language academies and doesn't make sense at all?,"Not every language is like English, where the concept of grammatical gender almost doesn't exist except for the pronouns he/him/she/her/they/them. Recently Demi Lovato came out as non-binary (whatever it means) and yesterday there was a heated argument on Polish subreddit about how someone butchered Polish language by editing the Wikipedia article about Demi Lovato.

Basically it looked like this:

&gt;\[...\] amerykańskie piosenkarum, autorum tekstów, muzykum, aktorum, reżyserum teledysków, kompozytorum, gitarzystum, pianistum i filantropum. Znanx z amerykańskiej edycji programu *X Factor*, gdzie zasiadałx w panelu jurorskim podczas drugiego i trzeciego sezonu. Oprócz tego popularność przyniósł jejmu serial Disney Channel *Słoneczna Sonny**,* gdzie grałx główną rolę, a także filmy *Camp Rock* oraz *Program ochrony księżniczek*. \[...\]

or like this:

&gt;\[...\] amerykańskx piosenkarx, autorx tekstów, muzyk, aktorx, reżyserx teledysków, kompozytorx, gitarzystx, pianistx i filantropx. \[...\]

Sorry, but in my opinion it's an awful abomination. It's unreadable. Maybe it works in English, but it doesn't work in many other languages, for example in Polish. We have three grammatical genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. If someone doesn't identify as masculine or feminine, then be my guest, you can use the neuter forms, but it sounds dehumanizing to say the least.

However, I think that making up idiotic forms is just wrong. Nobody's going to approve of changing the whole language just because a tiny percent of the native speaker population identifies themselves as non-binary. Just stop it. I can't imagine it being approved by the Polish Language Council. Things like this are getting out of hand nowadays, many people are oversensitive about the political correctness and such. Are we going to see ridiculous biographical films where the POC will play the role of people who were white as snow? There's a difference between keeping things real and idiocies.

What do you think about it? I can't accept it. Also, if you want to make non-binary pronouns and forms official and standard, then stop beeping and muting swear words. Swear words at least existed since forever and are the inherent part of the language, as opposed to those things that someone made up in recent years.",1621589668,Leopardo96,55

languagelearning,There is no mastery without mistakes. And there is no learning later without the courage to be rubbish.,"Just read this part in Effortless, by Greg McKeown and thought maybe it'll help some of you language learners!

""Many people cite learning a new language as an essential project, a dream that matters to them. But they never practice because they are embarrassed.

They want to be flawless—or at least not make fools of themselves—from the start. But a friend of mine who teaches Spanish sees it differently. As an exceptional student himself (with a JD from Stanford Law School followed by a doctorate from Princeton as well), he has learned that when it comes to languages, embracing mistakes leads to accelerated learning. 

He teaches his language students to imagine they have a bag full of one thousand beads. Every time they make a mistake talking to someone else in the language they take out one bead. When the bag is empty they will have achieved level 1 mastery. The faster they make those mistakes, the faster they will progress.

Is there something new you want to learn but feel overwhelmed by? Something that you know would add great value to you either personally or professionally but that you feel intimidated by because of the long road to mastery? Then try your own version of the “ bag of beads” exercise and shift your focus to making as many mistakes as possible when you’re starting out.

There is no mastery without mistakes. And there is no learning later without the courage to be rubbish.""",1621562318,humblecuriosity,1

languagelearning,How much do I learn by just listening?,"Hi, I have been learning French for about 4 months now and I got to the point where I can listen to some language learning focused podcasts such as Duolingo French or Little Talk in Slow French. I can get the basic of gist of almost every sentence and I completely understand what the people are  talking about in general. (I.e. the message they are trying to convey).

My question is, how much do I learn by just listening? I usually listen while on a walk with the dog or just walking in general, so I don't search up much new vocab or write anything down. I juts listen and actively try to understand. Does this help as well or is some sort of vocab reinforcement needed? Is me listening to these podcasts useless to my language learning or a major help?

languagelearning,Tips for returning to a language? (Specifically Spanish),"Hi everyone! I used to be fairly fluent in Spanish, I would say probably B2/C1 level, but that was about 10 years ago, and in that time I have never used it and therefore have lost a lot of it. I can still speak it at a pretty basic conversational level, and I sometimes read the news in Spanish and I can understand it okay. However, my listening and comprehension is definitely weakened and I have forgotten a lot of the advanced verb tenses, constructions, and idioms.

Does anyone have a method to pick a language back up after a long time when you have a fairly solid base in the language? I was considering subscribing to ""News In Slow Spanish"" or something like that.

languagelearning,narrowing ambitions,"Like many here, I find myself endlessly debating which languages I want to learn next, and trying to prioritize my ambitions, so much so that it often sidetracks me from my ""focus"" language.

I think I've finally managed to rope in my language ambitions. It finally dawned on me that the only reasons I have managed to get anywhere with my focus language are, a) I love the sound of it and could listen to it all day, and b) It has an absolutely massive amount of media (i.e. I can type ""let's play &lt;game&gt; &lt;language&gt;"" into YouTube for virtually any halfway popular game and have several options to choose from). With those ""requirements"" in mind, I realized there's only a small handful of languages I could realistically get this far with. This has given me a sort of newfound focus and motivation with my target language.

I know some people don't have this problem, but for those of us who do, I find it keeps me far less distracted when I *know* deep down that there are only a few languages I could ever realistically learn.

languagelearning,"People being 100% in multiple languages, is it that surprising or is it just me?","So as a person from an English-speaking country, language learning is not big. We only learn English formally but even then, or from where I’m from at least, English is more of a critical thinking subject.

I was one of those uneducated native speakers who didn’t know what the words reluctant or indifferent meant when I was 15. I was still saying stuff like “more bigger” or “worser” at 17. It wasn’t until I was 19, that I decided to fix my grammar and vocab myself. I’m also an Immigrant so yes I’m natural in Indonesian and Javanese too. I began picking them up over the past 2-3 years at a very lazy fashion. 

I met this girl a few months ago and her linguistic skills absolutely blow me away and put me to shame as an English native speaker. Of course these things can be attributed to her very privileged lifestyle and her time in constantly participating in debate competitions and english clubs etc. however, It still puts me to shame. Her English vocabulary is crazy, and her active spoken English is so good as well, so many different sayings and “big” words flow out of her mouth effortlessly. Her Indonesian is just as good. On top of that she is at a high level in Korean and elementary level in French. 

This makes me wonder, in other countries where learning languages is more of a big deal and is more of an interesting thing to the average person, is it really this common to find people who are 100% in multiple languages? It blows me away because people in English-speaking countries are horrible at English, even if they’re multilingual because of an immigrant past, they still are not 100% in the other language.",1621472264,bobbygil,20
languagelearning,Is it worth it to branch out and study more languages at my current TL level?,"Hello :) 

I don't really have anyone to talk to about language learning so I thought I'd come here to discuss! Apologies if the post is long, like I said, I never get a chance to talk about my language learning experience and thoughts haha so now they're all gonna come out at once. 

I'm 19 and English is my native language. When I was 15 I started self-studying Korean. I currently know around 5-6k words (this is an estimate, maybe I know more than this or a little less) but still can't read anything like news or novels etc without a dictionary lol, the only thing that I can do semi-fluently is text. 

I would really love to improve my Korean but I have honestly stagnated and the only way I think I would be able to push through it is just consuming more content in Korean, reading more news, novels, watching TV shows without Eng sub (which I still do because it's so comfortable ... ㅠ) etc and eventually the words I have to notate/look up on the dictionary I'll be exposed to over and over until I just remember them naturally. Doing this, I think it might take me like two more years before I could be completely fluent? If I did like 2hrs of dedicated immersion a day? The only thing I use my Korean for daily is texting so on top of that another 2hrs of writing longer essay-like response messages and consuming a ton of Korean content per day I think could bring me to that mystical ""fluency"" line where my own written Korean about any topic is indistinguishable and I don't need a dictionary anymore. 

The thing is that although Korean was my TL for years, I also spent 3 (useless) years in high school studying Japanese and know basic conversational Japanese (as well as grasp 90% of common grammar structures already because... Korean study hacks lol) that I could also spend time improving. I also see and hear Chinese languages like Mandarin and Cantonese spoken a lot and know how insanely useful it would be for my Korean and Japanese, and feel a desire to start learning basic Mandarin and learn tones and everything and Hanzi... sigh

Same thing with Russian, I listen to a lot of Russian music and want to at least learn to read and write in the Cyrillic alphabet, but I already feel like I have no more room for more language in my brain, even though learning comparatively basic things like that would be really fun for me.

I see a lot of the ""polyglot"" type people online who tote around their ""5+ languages"" but really don't know anything more than the basics in each, and I don't want to end up like any of them. 

If you were in my position, had a TL that was very close to fluency, already had experience with another language, and wanted to learn another, what would you do? Grind the TL to fluency without touching anything else? Keep the main TL on the backburner and bring up the second TL's skill? Or just have fun and go crazy learning whatever? I'm very afraid at this point that I am losing the ability to recall language properly from just having too much of it up there so maybe I should wait until I can have more drive space installed to continue. 

Any thoughts are greatly appreciated!",1621471751,epicchuseok,10

I am fluent in French. I have beginner’s knowledge of both Spanish and Italian, and no knowledge of Portuguese. 
I know that I want to learn all three languages, so ‘usefulness’ etc. doesn’t really matter to me. I would just love to be able to communicate well in all 3! If I must admit, I suppose I would be using Spanish  and Italian significantly more often than Portuguese. 
I heard somewhere that learning Portuguese first makes learning the other two a bit easier than doing it the other way around. Is this true? If so, I am certainly open to that. 
I know I will learn all three either way, I am mainly asking if anyone has suggestions for the easiest or most seamless/logical order.

languagelearning,Understanding regional accents,"Is there any way to get better at understanding regional accents in the language(s) you're learning?  I suppose that lots of contact with the accent would be best, but hope there are some tips or tricks that can help...

I've found that even in languages where I consider myself (reasonably) fluent, some regional accents are still difficult for me. For example, in English a spoken North East accent takes a lot of effort for me to understand (most Scottish accents are easier for me oddly enough).  In French, the Ch'ti is almost native to me because of family connections, but Languedocien sometimes confuses me (plus some other regional accents)

languagelearning,"Studying English deeper (accents, improving fluency, etc.) or studying another language?","A non-native English speaker here. Couldn't find a question of this kind in the Wiki. Here is the case and the question : 

I'm on a stalemate after many years of English studies. A situation which is so hard to push through that I don't really feel any acceleration or clear progress anymore, though I theoretically know I am getting better slowly. Let me describe this ""stalemate"" I'm babbling about.

Like many non-natives; through the years and years, I somehow got fluent enough in rather simple conversations, have no problem utilizing the basic instruments of the language and I can fully understand formally spoken English unless tricky words and phrases are put forth, and I have a mediocre understanding of the accents too.

But the thing is, I'm not consistently fluent with my English. I can do everyday activites fine like reading an ordinary book, an article, watching a video or a movie, speaking about weather and life. But I can't say I am very educated and enriched on English on a higher level. Lacking advanced grammar knowledge, knowledge on accents, knowledge on advanced pronounciation, an extensive vocabulary, I feel very incomplete. 

Don't get me wrong, I am absolutely not incompetent. As a medical student, I have no problem dealing with all the scientific literature of a basic level. But I want achieve a high quality and delicacy with my language knowledge and utilization. I won't be some non-native bimbo who scribbles some imperfect articles, gives so-so speeches on congresses, and consistently using flawed English. 

HERE'S THE CATCH : I feel incomplete, also because I don't have a third language like Spanish or German, which I would greatly benefit both intellectually and practically.


So, my point being, I have both intellectual and practical reasons for both learning a third language and striving towards perfecting my English.

Over time, I will eventually learn more languages, and perfect &amp; polish my English too. What I'm asking is, which should be the priority specifically before my graduation, for 4 years? I know I can learn many languages at a basic level in 4 years. Also I can further imrpove my English greatly in 4 years. But, you know, one simply doesn't have time to invest rigorously in both. ""Rigorously"", I underline.

Please let me know what you think on this dilemma. Thanks in advance.",1621377141,Put-Easy,7
languagelearning,Universal word lists,"Hello fellow language learners! 

I've noticed that I enjoy the process of beginning a new language a lot more than the grind that comes once you have the basics and just need to memorize a lot of vocabulary and grammar. As such I've been playing around with a lot of languages, such as Polish, Portuguese, Ukrainian, Swedish, etc. They're usually European languages so they're fairly similar but still provide a nice challenge.

I found that in all of these languages in order to get a basic proficiency I need to learn a set of words that seems to be very similar. To go, to stop, to be able to, to must, to want to, to walk, to drive, to fly, to read, to write, to learn, to teach, etc. 

Is there a universal vocabulary list that I can use to standardize my language learning? I've often seen lists that are sorted by usage frequency, but they're usually not cleaned of various prepositions, articles, conjugated forms of verbs, etc.

My ideal would be like a worksheet, with all of the most important words in English along the left, and blanks on the right that I can fill in for whatever language I happen to be learning at the moment. Or just a list of the most important vocabulary with translations, but available for multiple languages.

languagelearning,C1 Proficiency in Spanish but still feel like I cannot speak it,"In short, I've taken Spanish classes since I was in 7th Grade (2006) and really dedicated myself to learning the language. I enrolled in every single Spanish-related class in high-school (up to AP Spanish, and then minored in the language in university, graduating just 6 credits (two classes away) from double-majoring in the language. Several of the classes I took in university were *very* language intensive, such as a Macroeconomics course taught entirely in Spanish or a 20th century Spanish literature class taught by a professor who barely knew English herself (or so she claimed). I also lived and worked in Costa Rica for three months during a summer where I stayed with a host family who spoke no English. I've written 10+ page academic papers in Spanish, and I can comfortably read a novel in Spanish or follow along with a Spanish-speaking TV program. 

Last year, to satisfy a graduation requirement for my master’s degree in international relations, I had to demonstrate a level C1 fluency (CEFR-effective operational proficiency/advanced) in a foreign language (Spanish), which I successfully did. I also took a generic international relations class taught in Spanish just to brush up my basic Spanish IR-theory vocab/concepts. 

Even with all of the above, I struggle with speaking the language in a non-academic context. In an academic-context, or when speaking the language alone (I often record myself speaking it), or with close Spanish-speaking peers, I speak clear, concise Castilian Spanish. However when I try to speak it randomly to people when there isn’t a real need (I tried to compliment my Spanish speaking neighbor's sneakers the other day on the elevator, for example) I basically lose knowledge of the language and sound like someone who is speaking the language for the first time. 

I don't think its necessarily anxiety as I don't feel it consciously (as in I electively wanted to strike up a conversation with my neighbor) but I cannot figure my hesitancy or why I would score so proficient on a language that I don't necessarily feel comfortable with...imposter syndrome? Given that there are still COVID restrictions where I am and it isn't really practical to find a partner to speak 1:1 with, is there anything I can do? 

I was thinking of just instead of listening to music listening to Spanish podcasts, reviewing my notes/textbooks from school from cover to cover, and trying to read Spanish print-media out loud to get my brain more comfortable with speaking it. 

Any suggestions would be great!",1621357614,walkallover1991,16

languagelearning,Help me choose a language to learn in University.,"For reasons I will start a degree next year on Modern Languages. The whole basis of this is to learn a pair of languages and study their literatures and cultures, but mainly to learn the languages. Now I know what language I will choose as first, that being Chinese. But then I need to choose a second one and with this I am having doubts. Basically every major language is avaliable, specially if its european (From Catalan to Serbo croatian). 

Now I am posting this because maybe you all have some insight, or some advice to choice. The three languages I am mainly thinking about are: 

**Arabic** \- I live in a country that is very close to the Arabic world, as such lots of arabic speakers in my city. Also spoken by a lot of people. I have been told tho that most arabic speakers also speak a decent enough french and english, both of which I already speak. Also I am an LGBT woman so most arabic countries is not what I think about to travel to and be safe in.  
Also a working language of the UN which is always useful.

**Japanese** \- The least economically sound choice, but the one I probably know the most about and that interests me the most. I like Japanese music and media, and I like the language. Also by studying Japanese + Chinese I get a mention on Asian languages, which is always a good thing to have when getting a degree. But it is not spoken outside of Japan, not very useful overall to be honest. Also supposedly one of the hardest languages there are overall for me. Also I am worried I may get confused between hanzi and kanji readings. 

**Russian** \- Most people that have told me not to learn Arabic have instead recommended to go for Russian. Very much spoken throughout Asia. I really like Russian music but I don't much Russian media. Apparently the best choice for work? 

Now I have not decided to learn one of those 3, just the ones that caught my eye. I will choose the year following next one so I am not really on any rush, just want to know your opinion, specially of those that have learned any of those 3 languages.

languagelearning,Language Jam hosted by Xefjord's Complete Language Series,"Hello Reddit! Some of you may remember me, but for those who don't I am Xefjord and I run a website attempting to create survival level Anki courses for every known living language.  


A couple years ago or so I heard about a ""Language Jam"" like event where learners would roll two random languages then have to learn one of them over the course of like a month or a week, and ever since I started my project I was interested in doing something similar with my project. I offer over 70 languages and while many are big, many are rather small and obscure and I figured this kind of event would help people gain exposure to some of the minority languages and cultures they may have never considered.  


So I decided to host my own Language Jam! The purpose is two-fold, to host a fun event exposing people to new languages and get the language community interacting and learning, as well as to stress test my courses and get feedback on them. At the end I would love to hear people's thoughts on the courses they took as well as their thoughts on the language and how they might use it in the future.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So how do you participate? Well the **Language Jam will be officially starting on June 1st and lasting until June 7th**. You will have one week to get as far as you can in the language course you pull, but if your language has a different writing system, you can start as early as May 25th to start working on an mastering how to read and write (Since that is often the pre-requisite for my courses). That is one week from now.  


You can join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/Dne3YUJ) or the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/XefsCompleteLangs/) to track your progress over the course of the event. And you can download each course from my website (Which you will find googling Xefjord's Complete Language Series, it is on Wix and Reddit doesn't like Wix links).  


\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you would like to discuss it here, listed below is the list of languages you can roll for the upcoming language jam, you will roll two random numbers via the website [https://www.random.org/](https://www.random.org/) (set it from 1 to 73) and then see which two languages those numbers correlate to, if the random number includes a language you already know you can re-roll. Pick one of the two languages you roll to learn. If the language includes multiple dialect courses you can pick whichever dialect you like. Here is the list:

1. Spanish
2. French
3. Italian
4. Portuguese
5. Catalan
6. Sicilian
7. German
8. Swiss German

I quite enjoy the more gamey aspects of certain language learning platforms, although it often doesn't really feel like I'm learning that much of practical value, and some of the more trial &amp; error bits aren't very good at actually teaching you in detail what exactly you did right/wrong so that it can sink in and embed itself in your mind. What I like about it though is not so much the social-competitive aspects (which I can take or leave), but the clearly visible sense of progress and reward, just like in great videogames I've enjoyed since I was a kid.   


What I'm wondering is, are there any actual videogames out there which can effectively teach you a language from beginner level onwards? And if not, someone's missing a huge opportunity because I reckon there's a readymade market for it (please don't tell me to make it myself, 'cause I'd love to but I don't know shit haha)  


I know you could just play pretty much any game you like in the language you're trying to learn, and as long as you're reasonably unfamiliar with what's going on in each scene it could be a good way of getting in the groove of it, like watching foreign-language films and tele. But it won't have been designed specifically for the purpose of helping the player learn the language, and that's something I'd love - a game that's fun to play in its own right, but which is also masterfully laying down those pathways in your brain to properly grasp a spoken/written foreign language whilst you do it, completely unconsciously even!   


Any suggestions? Ta",1621328168,anthyk,61

languagelearning,Would I have an easier time with Icelandic since I already know German?,"I used to be an upper intermediate in German, though I've since gotten rusty. Luckily, I still have my comprehension, just not my production. German grammar to me is quite natural I've known it for so long. It used to be I hardly even noticed which language I was speaking because German was as natural to me as my native English. Luckily, I seemed to automatically talk in which ever language the other person was speaking without thinking about it. To me, the two are just different 'modes'. I don't filter German through my native English since I started learning it at a fairly young age. To me, a book is also ein Buch. I don't think 'Buch=book thus this object is ein Buch'. Being older now, I'm not so sure I could learn to process another language the same way, but oh well. I hear doing that doesn't actually make you worse of a speaker, though I think it would take you far longer to interpret what you hear and formulate responses. 

I'm aware Icelandic isn't that closely related to German, but I've read the most difficult thing for learners to master is the case system. German has the same system, so I'm quite used to it and in fact quite like it. Of course, I doubt Icelandic's system matches German's perfectly, I'm just saying I'm already familiar with case systems. When I see that a language has case, that's hardly a turn-off for me (unlike for other Americans). I also study articulatory phonetics so I'm fairly certain I wouldn't have much trouble pronouncing it (though these 'pre-aspirated consonants' may take a bit of practice, and yes, I can distinguish aspirated consonants fairly reliably).

languagelearning,Convincing people to practice a language with you?,"I'm in the perhaps-common position of knowing multiple people who are fluent or native in a language I am trying to (re-)learn.  Basically, I used to be fluent in Spanish and still understand it ""fluently"" and read it with no problems, but due to disuse over the past decade my speaking is pretty bad (my accent is fine but I have a very hard time coming up with vocabulary, some grammar, and almost everything I try to say is a word-for-word transliteration from English).  My mom and sister are fluent in Spanish but we exclusively use English with each other (they're both physicians and use Spanish daily at work, though) and it honestly feels weird to try and speak Spanish with them.  In any case, I think what I'm missing here is mostly vocabulary and colloquial speech so I'm listening to podcasts and watching lots of Spanish TV without subtitles, but not really speaking it.

I'm also trying to learn Portuguese (I have four good friends who are Brazilian-American and would love to do a long-term visit to Brazil after the pandemic).  I've been interested in the language (and Brazilian music) for over a decade, and in undergrad took an accelerated ""Portuguese for Spanish speakers"" class for a semester (obviously I remember barely anything from it, but I've been meaning to get back to it for years).  

Over the past few months I've gotten deep into Portuguese duolingo, some books, podcasts, more music, etc. and I'm trying to bootstrap my Portuguese over my obviously much more advanced Spanish.  I've learned a bunch of Portuguese-specific vocab and grammar, but fill in any holes with Spanish words pronounced in a Portuguese way (for example, if I don't know almoço I'll say ""almuerzu"" and hope it can be inferred from context).  One of my friends says my attempts at portuñol are understandable (his Spanish is really rusty but he can understand almost everything I try to say) he just thinks I sound kind of ridiculous and wants me to stick to English with him until ""I can speak proper Portuguese"", which is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem.

The corporation works with the automotive industry, a very demanding and competitive sector. To meet high customer demand (only on one part), they needed to increase their efficiency. In consequence, they decided to invest in the automation and robotisation of their facilities to obtain greater productivity and flexibility. They opted to automate the second step of the process which is the broaching process – and to do that, they sent a broaching machine to XXX, which is where the automation programmers are located. So, I was given the task of relocating the broaching unit within the workshop and thus optimising the production line.

languagelearning,"""Negative"" immersion effects","A query for the experts of language learning: we all know immersion is a great way to learn, but what are some of the recommended approaches to mitigate when there is a ""negative"" immersion effect? i.e. what if there are unavoidable environmental influences when it comes to pronunciation?

Context: we've been raising our kid bilingual (English and Mandarin), which has been working relatively well and he shows great interest in different languages. The current challenge I face is that family members/relatives speak Mandarin in regional dialects that do not emphasis proper pronunciation of some sounds, particularly on r-like retroflex sounds. it's a bit difficult to explain in English... a close example would be it's like saying ""snake"" as *sh'nake,* or conversely  saying ""share"" as *s'are.* Another example is f-like fricatives sounds pronounced as ""hu""-sound, such as saying ""fin"" as *hu'in*. I guess what I am trying to articulate is that it's not merely a difference in accent, but actually an incorrect pronunciation in the common standard. 

It's a losing battle because I am the only one that tries to speak ""accurately"" with him, while others around him outnumber me almost 10:1. Fortunately the kid is willing to learn and be corrected, but he's also growing frustrated because many around him do not speak it correctly. The others recognize this but there's just no way to correct the force of habit after decades of saying words a certain way.

languagelearning,Building a better LingQ - Community Gathering of Learning Resources,"The unveiling of LingQ to the language learning community has led a slew of similar apps and services to follow suit - Learning with Text, Bliu Bliu, Readlang and OPLingo to name a few. While the core functionality of LingQ is relatively well understood and has been recreated several times in different platforms, what I wish to discuss today deals with an equally important aspect of language learning, and that's the quality and quantity of the comprehensible input used in language learning.

Precursors to the idea includes tools like Amara and a Chinese app called 译学馆(roughly School of Language Study Through Translations). Both offerings features an interface where contributors can contribute subtitles/translations to videos in a foreign language, and a mechanism to control for the quality of the subtitles produced. In addition, both platforms features hundreds of contributors, and has resulted in the creation of thousands of educational videos with bilingual subtitles that can be used for language study.

Taking the idea a step further, in addition to creating subtitles/translations, we can create interfaces to produce word glosses/word by word translations to texts, add audio recording to foreign language texts, as well as notes &amp; annotations to text, and means for common questions on the learning material to be answered by the community. Doing so will produce high quality language learning material that will be much more enjoyable to study, and if anything close to the scale of Amara and 译学馆 can be achieved, produce enough material at different levels for a learner to reach B2/C1 level of proficiency for the most popular languages.

Which brings me to the next point: how can a sizable library of high quality language learning material be prepared by the community? Up until recently, I have no satisfactory answer to this question. But upon stumbling across the excellent community learning app Yask recommended by someone else on this subreddit, I think there's now a clear path for that vision to be fulfilled. For every hour a language learner spends learning on the platform, we push to the learner a stream of ten minutes of contribution tasks in his/her native language, asking him/her to subtitle a popular video in his/her native language, add an audio recording to a task, or contribute translations/answers if he/she is able to. The tasks would be divided into manageable chunks, distributed to community members to perform by the platform, and the results reviewed and published by dedicated volunteers. Similar to and inspired by Yask, this model of a stream of microtasks would enable community members to help each other and contribute to a common goal, and unlike Yask, where people help one person at a time, the resources gathered through this process can be consumed by hundreds and even thousands of people, making it a truly community built content library that would potentially benefit tens of thousands of language learners across all countries. As a final thought, I think having translated versions of graded articles like those on Newsela can be especially helpful for gradually building proficiency in a foreign language, and such an undertaking required the collective effort of the community.

I am still working on the details of this model, but if you are willing to offer suggestions or wish to contribute to this pro bono endeavor in some form, leave a comment so more discussion could be had on the subject. What do y'all think?",1621275342,EntrepreneurOk2343,15
languagelearning,Are university language classes worth it?,"Specifically, are language classes at four-year public universities in the United States worth it? I would greatly appreciate any advice/input from anyone who has taken language classes at this level.

I'll be attending university next fall, and taking language classes, possibly even getting a language minor, has been something that has always interested me. Unfortunately the university I will be attending does not offer Swedish classes (I was previously planning on attending a university that did have a Swedish program, but my plans have changed fairly recently). I'm a bit conflicted as to what I should do.

I've been self-studying Swedish for a while, and within the past few months managed to test at a B1 level. I'm really happy with my Swedish progress, and I am a bit worried about potentially throwing that progress away by accident, however I also am worried that if I pass up the opportunity to study a language at university then I'll regret it later on.

Part of me wants to look into taking courses in either French or German while attending university, however the reality is that this would both add more money on to my bill as well as most likely stall my progress in Swedish (I might be able to maintain what I have, but learning anything new while studying another language and studying for my major is highly unlikely). I'm also worried though that even if I don't take language classes that my Swedish progress will stall anyway just because I'll be too busy to want to/be able to self-study with the same intensity that I do now, in which case I would end up leaving university still being unable to speak any language other than English at an advanced level.

In the end, I think I'd be willing to pay a bit extra and potentially stall my Swedish progress for a while if the classes would actually be a worthwhile experience, both in terms of learning value as well as being an enjoyable way for me to make sure I consistently get to study languages (something I really love doing). That's why I'm looking for advice though, just because I've also heard plenty of people say bad things about language classes and I would hate to be paying more money and making myself unnecessarily busy (not to mention giving up my momentum with Swedish) if the classes were going to be awful and I wasn't going to learn much anyway.

languagelearning,Immerse yourself in the language: what is the strategy?,"Hey yall,

I am learning german everyday super ineffectively for about 6 months (I would say I am somewhere at a low A2 level). Getting frustrated with the slow progress, I reviewed my ""strategy"" and realised that perhaps not enough variety, effort and actual strategy were put in. 

One of the most common advices was to immerse yourself in the language (of course, among studying grammar, learning vocabulary, etc.). If I understand it correctly, it is advised to watch movies, listen to music, podcasts, read various articles, or basically just anything to expose yourself to TL. 

My question, I guess, is, how do you work with that? For example, I read a newspaper article and I do not understand some words or constructions.

languagelearning,"Veuillez m’aider à corriger mon article, s’il vous plaît","L’esprit de compétition: un vrai poison pour la vie sociale

Bien que nous soyons les étudiants, nous ne sommes pas à l’abri de la compétition. En effet, nous sommes soumis à la concurrence acharnée depuis notre enfance. Nous sommes classés et évalués selon nos notes, notre intelligence, notre réalité physique, notre milieu, et même notre apparence. La question s’impose : la compétition, est-elle fructueuse ou néfaste ?

Le classement supprime la solidarité

Tandis que le classement compétitif existe, il est tentant de marcher sur les pieds d’autres et négliger les amitiés pour l’avantage personnel.

Prenons, en guise d’exemple, une situation scolaire. Une amie sollicite votre soutien pour un examen imminent parce qu’elle a manqué les classes à cause de la grippe. Sachant qu’elle est désavantagée, vous refusez de partager vos fiches. Par contrecoup : vous réussissez l’examen haut la main, elle galère, et votre rapport est bel et bien brisé.

Donc, pourrait-on dit que la compétition répandue est fructueuse ? Au contraire : c’est une force nocive qui délabre la vie sociale et qui cultive l’égoïsme. Il nous pousse à poursuivre l’intérêt personnel coûte que coûte afin de réussir dans la vie.

L’importance ultime de la connexion humaine

On pourrait dire que l’esprit de compétition répandue dans notre société est comme une drogue. On se languie de réussir, de gravir les échelons à tout prix, et par conséquent on oublie l’importance de la connexion humaine.

Considérons, encore, l’amie malade. Si vous aviez envoyé vos fiches sans plaintes, votre amie étaient reconnaissante et soulagée, et votre amitié renforcée. 

N’oublions pas que la solidarité et l’amitié sont, à long terme, plus importantes que notre conception du « succès » du fait de la compétition. Nous sommes êtres humains, et ce dont nous avons besoin, c’est la connexion, la cohésion, les réseaux de soutien. Rendons équitable et agréable le monde, pas à pas, en nous débarrassant de la compétitivité superfétatoire. Et l’antidote ? C’est l’entraide.

Des remarques finales

Nous vivons dans une société tellement compétitive qu’il n’y plus lieu pour l’amitié et la solidarité. Il est donc primordial qu’on accorde plus d’importance à nos vies sociales afin de cultiver une société plus modérée, positive, et généralement agréable.",1621220419,callowgraves,0

languagelearning,2200 Hours of Japanese in 1 Year,"2200 Hours of Japanese in 1 Year

So as the title says I've invested over 2200 hours into Japanese the past year, this averages out to just over 6 hours every day. 


Here's the breakdown of my stats:
Reading: ~520 hrs. Average of 90 +- 45 minutes per day
Listening: ~1350 hrs. Average of 3.5 +- 1.25 hours per day
Anki: ~6600 cards (not including RRTK), ~335 hours. Average of 45 +- 15 minutes per day
Speaking/Writing: 0 hrs


Here is a rough timeline of my previous year with Japanese.
	1. Month 1
	Grinded out a lot of beginner material with Anki by doing 100 new cards each day: approximately ~2 hours per day 
			Did Recognition Remembering the Kanji (~1250 cards)
			For vocabulary I went through the Tango N5/N4 decks (~2000 cards)
			For grammar I read through Tae Kim's grammar guide
		Started reading NHK easy articles once I finished Tango N5 and Tae Kim near the end of the month
	2. Month 2-3
		Continued grinding out material with Anki at a reduced pace of 25-35 cards per day: ~90 minutes each day
			I sentence mined the Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar and about 1/4 of the Dictionary of Intermediate Japanese Grammar. (~700 cards)
			Went through the Tango N3 deck (~1300 cards)
		Made the monolingual transition
			All Anki cards now used Japanese explanations for new vocabulary/grammar
			Started using Japanese dictionaries in Yomichan when looking up words on the fly
	3. Month 4-6
		Started sentence mining from Native Material (Anime and real news articles from NHK)
	4. Months 7-9
		Started to read Novels and Light Novels
	5. Months 10-12
		Nothing of note- continued immersing and doing my anki each day. Focused on reading novels.
	6. Continuous
		Throughout the entire year I was immersing in Native Japanese materials for hours every day, even from day 1 when I understood nothing.
		For listening this includes: YouTube videos, anime, drama, movies, podcasts, audiobooks.
		For reading: news articles, blogs/web articles, wikipedia, novels, light novels, SNS comments (I haven't ever really read manga).
		

Here is my subjective basis on my current level:
	1. Reading
		I can read and understand most novels, news articles, light novels, etc. if I can use a J-J dictionary with Yomichan. 
			Based upon Refold's 6 Levels of Comprehension, most novels are somewhere between a Level 4 and a Level 5 in terms of comprehension; I would describe this as, ""with effort (Yomichan), able to understand the content- main plot, dialogues/monologues, and descriptions- with some details lost"".
		Obviously some books are easier than others, and difficulty of books can vary even when written by the same author. 
			For example here are some of the books that I've read with near full comprehension：
				ペンギン・ハイウェイ
				NHKにようこそ！
				キノの旅
			Here are some books that I thought were quite difficult when reading them:
				人間失格
				四畳半神話大系
				狼と香辛料
		Without a dictionary I would wager that my reading ability for novels is a solid level 4: ""able to follow the main plot of a story and the majority of the ideas that are presented despite occasionally missing details of the story"".

	2. Listening
		I have pretty much full comprehension of most Slice of Life anime while listeing raw. 
			Anime that fall in this category would be the following:
				けいおん！
				月刊少女野崎くん
		With Japanese subtitles I am able to understand a variety of shows at close to full comprehension, occasionally having to look something up to fill in a gap.
			Example shows include:
				Fate Stay Night (I've seen this like 4 times though so that does contribute to my knowledge of what is happening)
				Terrace House
				俺の妹がこんなに可愛いわけがない
				黒子のバスケ
			Some anime that I feel were particularily challenging were:
				食戟のソーマ
				幼女戦記
				四畳半神話大系
				ドクターストン
		My raw listening ability really depends on who I am listening to and how much I have listening to them before hand.
			I am able to follow along with most YouTubers, albeit I might miss some details here and there depending on how much I have listened to them before. 
			Here are some example of people that I feel comfortable listening to (level 4-5 comprehension):
				Utaco 4989
				キヨ。
				牛沢
				フジ工房
			Youtubers that I struggle with (level 3-4 comprehension):
				メンタリストダイゴ
				ひろゆき
	
	3. Writing 
		I haven't worked on handwriting at all so it's fair to say that I'm not able to do it. I'm honestly not worried about this becuase most everything is typed nowadays anyway and I don't live in Japan and won't for the forseeable future.

	4. Speaking
		I have never had a conversation with a native Japanese person; I am able to form some thoughts naturally (ie. without translating), but I doubt I would feel comfortable in a conversation with my current level.


What are my plans going forward?
	1. Continue getting lots of input, focusing on reading novels
		During the summer I am going to aim for the following:
			Listening: at least 2 hours per day
			Reading: at least 2 hours per day
			Anki: reviews + 10-15 new cards per day (~30-40 minutes)
		I am currently reading the following books:
			１９７３年のピンボール
			娘じゃなくて私が好きなの！？
			幼女戦記
			魔女の宅急便
	2. Work on output starting in 3-6 months
		I think that I have built up enough of a foundation in comprehending the language, and I would like to convert this latent ability into producing the language in a natural manner.
		I would like to be ""fluent"" (ie. able to hold a reasonably well paced conversation with a native on a variety of everyday topics without needing any help) by the end of my second year.
	3. Work through some JLPT prep books for the N1 test so I can take it at the 18 month mark (December)
		I bought the 新完全マスター N1・N2 books for grammar and reading comprehension and I am just going to make sentence cards for unknown grammar points or vocabulary I come across.
		This will be ~30 minutes of my reading every day.

languagelearning,Why Native English Speakers Only Speak English,"I’m an Australian living in Europe. I have spent a fair amount of time away from Australia, studying in South America and now living in Europe. Living amongst internationals, one thing that comes up a lot is ‘why do you only speak one language?’ 9/10 times these people only speak their mother tongue along with English.

Growing up on an island, speaking the lingua franca of the world, the truth is, what’s the point of a second language?

A lot of people I encounter claim to speak ‘several languages’. Well, many times it is just bluff. They may know a few phrases here and there but the languages they learnt during high school or university have long been forgotten. Sure they may be able to order from a menu in Spanish or French, but sit them next to a native speaker and force them to talk about current affairs, sports or any typical conversation topic between two adults, and you will soon realise they only remember vague sentences from high school. 

In most cases, most people speak their mother tongue and English. So, if your mother tongue is English, where does this leave you?

For 4 years I had a large connection with Latin America and spent quite some time in Latin America. Therefore, I saw a need to develop my Spanish. I managed to pass my B1 exam only to return to Australia and never hear or speak the language again. I now call Belgium home and have trouble being a mute in circumstances where English isn’t useful. This prompts me to learn Dutch or French. 
 
The point I’m conveying is that Native English speakers aren’t ‘lazy’. We just don’t have a need for a second language. I am not taking away the credit one puts in to learn a language though it is important to remember that languages are in most circumstances learnt for cultural purposes or requirements for employability in the country. Think of a journalism student and why he or she wouldn’t study physics. Physics is valuable but when will a journalist use physics?
 
For most people, languages are assets and are cultural. The day I go home to Australia, I will continue to live my life in English and English only. The foreign language I learnt will have no connection to my culture, my country or my career. Try and learn a second language that differs from your national languages as well as English and see it from that perspective. 

I guess a lot of people in the world see English as a political and economical sort of skill or associate it with media. Like learning basic maths, it’s expected and is quite standard. Most of the world forget that this is our native tongue and isn’t something we leave behind at work each day. It’s the language I tell my mum I love her in, it’s the language I used to speak my first words, it’s the language of my country and identity.

Should I put Italian on hold as well and focus all my time on French, Hebrew, and Dutch as those are most important to me right now?

languagelearning,"Which pair of languages (one Romance, one non-Romance) should I learn next, as someone who wants to learn them all eventually? What resources did YOU use?","To start off: I've read the FAQ wiki and have personal interest in all of these languages for different reasons, but am looking for opinions from people who speak similar languages that I currently do and who have embarked upon the following languages and their anecdotal success or what they wish they would have known. 

I'm an American and a linguist who was raised as a monolingual, acquired Spanish fluency largely through immersion in adulthood, who's been studying Korean for about 7 years, and who moved to the Netherlands 3 years ago so has been learning Dutch. CEFR wise I am probably between a C1 and C2 in Spanish, a B2 in Korean, and B1 in Dutch. I also learned German in high school and college, but understandably, that has sort of gone by the wayside out of lack of use and because Dutch has taken over. 

I'm looking for opinions on which languages to start next, understanding that I want to learn **all** these languages eventually (a tall order lol), and also understanding that I'll be continuing to improve my Korean and Dutch along the way. I want to try and pick up one Romance language and one non-Romance language, understanding that progress will be slow, but for the former, I'll be relying on my Spanish to kickstart me. 

I've listed my pros and challenges (because is there really a con in a language?) but I'm super interested in if any of you with similar language backgrounds have picked any of these up, and what you'd recommend.   


Here we go! 

**Non-Romance**

|Language|Pros|Challenges|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Mandarin|Already have a YoYo Chinese account; there are a ton of resources on italki and in apps; much of the vocab will be familiar owing to Korean (and later, reading may actually help me with advanced Korean); super easy grammar; fun to speak, widely spoken! |Tones are difficult for an English speaker; I'm concerned the level of dedication at the start might be higher than other languages so might get frustrated more easily by making relatively less progress |
|Arabic|I studied this for two semesters in college so can read and write (slowwwwwly); I'm interested in it and there are a lot of native speakers around me; some shared Spanish cognates|Pronunciation and grammar are **so** hard for me; relatively fewer ""fun"" online sources that I can find (give me tips if you know them!); a ton of dialects to choose from and most places seem to start with MSA which isn't really spoken? Choosing a dialect grants access to a specific speaker group, but certainly not all |
|Japanese|Recently became very drawn to it for reasons I don't understand; grammar is similar to Korean; a bazillion media sources, apps, overall resources to get me started|Might mix it up with Korean in a lot of ways; I have zero background here so starting 100% fresh; THREE WRITING SYSTEMS?? Is my current draw fleeting?|
|Turkish|I love the way it sounds; also a super widely spoken language in the Netherlands so could be helpful; lol Altaic language hypothesis? but not really|I can't think of a ton of challenges except that I'm starting 100% fresh again with this; not sure about resource availability in terms of apps, media|
|Russian|Another ""love the way it sounds,"" huge community of speakers, Russian tiktok is one of my new favorite things, I also love the idea of learning Cyrillic |Starting from zero again! No knowledge of the language whatsoever, nothing about Russian is shared with English, Dutch, Spanish, OR Korean to my knowledge so this is likely the most ""new"" I can get |
|German|This would take very little effort on my part, I think -- I was super good at it in high school and college; Germany's right there |Am I gonna mix it up with Dutch? Probably. Am I not incredibly overwhelmed at the idea of picking it up next? Am I not incredibly overwhelmed at the idea of mastering German declension again? Also probably. |

&amp;#x200B;

**Romance languages**

|Language|Pros|Challenges|
|:-|:-|:-|
|French|Dutch uses a lot of French loan words; it's the closest other spoken language besides like Frisian; would grant a ton of access to speaker groups; I love how it sounds|lol spelling and pronunciation; numbers???? I am very intimidated trying to break out French w/ French people (especially as an American)|
|Portuguese|I think it'd be an easy win because of Spanish; I'd be able to communicate with almost anyone from Canada down to Argentina and all places in between with at least one national language; I like the way it sounds a lot|Not a ton of opportunity to speak it here; seems like I might get bored because of \*how\* similar it is to Spanish (this might be a really ignorant perception though, tell me if it is)|
|Italian|Love the way it sounds; another easy win (maybe?); when I listen to Italian speakers and read Italian text I already understand so much|When am I gonna speak Italian outside of Italy during this panino? |

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, I've been told by several of the teachers at my school that I ""shouldn't bother trying to hard to learn Korean"" since ""I can just get by in English much easier"".  That has been a big discouragement.  I try to study on my own by reading and watching shows in Korean, but without the interaction from speaking, I feel like my conversational ability has not improved much.  I could attend Korean classes or go to a language school, but that costs a lot of money and time.

I’m having some trouble when it comes to formulating a study plan for the grammar. I spent the first while learning the alphabet and how to connect words and then after that I’ve been studying and trying to memorize chunks of vocabulary based on a frequency list and then after a certain point I’ll do some grammar to compliment it and repeat.

languagelearning,Unsure on how to approach learning French for its literature,"So I've recently picked up French as a TL and I've been running into some issues in deciding what my routine should be considering that my main purpose in learning the language is to read French literature. At some point, I probably will want to move onto speaking it, but I don't really see that being a concern of mine anytime soon. This mainly becomes a bit of a problem as most people seem to turn to language learning primarily out of interest in the speaking portion of communication and, as such, most stuff out there is centered around that. As I may want to speak French at some point (and just to make reading more enjoyable), I know I should work on building up a little French internal voice, which would entail a lot of listening, and I'm definitely gonna need a lot of vocabulary. I know I'm gonna need to know some basic grammar, but otherwise, I'm p lost.

I know I can't really just plunge into reading kid's books like I am with Spanish atm because I simply do not have that basis, but I don't really know much on how to build that basis. 

I feel like I can skimp on a lot at the moment, especially regarding output based exercises and grammar, but I'm not quite sure what exactly I should be skimming over and what I should really be focusing on.

Background:
- English: native speaker in the US
- Japanese: heritage speaker + went to Japanese school every Saturday for 12 years, fluent but not perfect
- French: learning in school for a total of nine years (but the first three were all very basic French repeated and were also separated by a few years so it hardly even counts), roughly B2?

My problem is, I’m getting a bit bored. French isn’t quite as thrilling anymore since I’m in maintenance mode instead of learning mode. Same with Japanese. I’ve also wanted to learn Russian for a while, but I wanted to improve my French first. Now that I’m at an okay level in all of my languages (also majoring in French starting in the fall), I feel like I can move on to Russian. I’m not as concerned about mixing up French and Russian because of how different they are; I’m mostly worried that I’ll wind up being mediocre at everything. If I’m going to start Russian, though, I do want to start young (I’m 18). My question is, should I start Russian or spend that energy improving my French and Japanese?

But does that even make any difference in terms of how well you learn a language? Should you aim at a more balanced approach, where you learn everything simultaneously, or can everything easily be picked up in several steps?

languagelearning,A Personal Approach to Language Learning,"This approach assumes you want to be able to speak naturally, native-like and instinctively, without having to think about it consciously.

That means, after taking this approach, you should be able to understand sentences in your target language without translation, make sentences without thinking about grammar, use words that mean what you want to express without translation, speak using natural speech patterns and think in your target language. You should be able to do all this naturally with no delay, without having to force it.

Let us set a baseline that getting lots of native input works for language learning, regardless of combination with other methods.

This approach recommends that you only consume content with audio that is made for natives by natives, without speaking or reading (not even speaking in your head), until you are able to do the things expressed above. Note that language production will come to you naturally; if you have to force it, you're not there yet.

This is because of my potentially controversial opinion that the other methods actively cause harm against the goal.

Grammar drills will harm your ability to make sentences naturally without thinking about it. Learning vocabulary out of context will harm your ability to use the words correctly. Learning vocabulary from looking up in a dictionary instead of context may harm your ability to use the words naturally. Learning to produce the language too early will fossilize mistakes. Learning to speak (or read) too early will fossilize bad speech patterns and pronunciation.

You may disagree on the particulars in the comments, probably especially about looking up in a dictionary.

\-- Extra --

What next? After you achieved the goal, it is probably safe to read without deterioration in the goal as long as you still do what is recommended above in tandem.

How exactly to consume the native content? I'm not sure either. I did describe the type of immersion you have to do, but there are more questions that you should think about. How much should you repeat the material vs consuming new material. How hard is too hard or too easy? Should you be enjoying the content? These are the finer details that probably do not matter much as long as you consume a lot.

\-- Footnote --

I do not want to have to say this, but this is not a shortcut and does not mean less effort. Far from it. You'll experience even greater struggles and frustrations with consuming what you can't understand. You'll have to come to terms with ambiguity. You'll be racking your brain both consciously and subconsciously as you try to understand the content. You'll have to accept that you won't be speaking the language right from the start, and for a long time. You'll have to spend a lot of time and effort into consuming the content, as well as finding more depending on the availability. I emphasize, it takes generally thousands of hours to get good.

You could instead learn grammar and give up on the goals of speaking naturally, for the immediate benefits of being able to speak the language albeit unnaturally. Sometimes, life forces this path upon you. However, if you do have the resources to be able to do this, ask yourself this. Is it worth it?

languagelearning,rant about studying languages at university,"I became rather interested in foreign languages during the last 2 years of my high school.. so I decided to study languages at university but my interest and motivation have only decreased. I have learnt English and French - both with the help and guidelines of my high school teachers but also thanks to an abundant amount of independent study and immersion, I've also learnt Spanish on my own to an intermediate level and I can speak Russian so believe me I have loads of experience with language learning and different teachers and methods. 
During my last year in high school, I was preparing for a french exam to and from not being able to write a sentence without mistakes, I ended up writing essays and I got a very high mark from my exam, all thanks to my wonderful teacher who gave me a lot of grammar, writing exercises and so on.

I am just hugely disappointed with my university language learning experience. I feel like my French got even worse after one year of studying like I am not able to think and talk as fast and my written skills haven't improved at all. I just don't understand how is it possible to learn a language here if teachers never correct students' mistakes when speaking, they do not encourage us to talk or communicate in a target language - they just say don't worry it's okay if you don't know how to say it and student stops talking or continues talking incorrectly, like excuse me?! And it's like this every single class. 
We had like 4 written assignments during the whole year whereas I used to write short essays or other writing assignments almost every week and I felt encouraged and I was improving because we were actually learning. 
What I don't understand the most is that they teach us the basics of grammar but expect us to us very advanced grammar structures and write with no to little mistakes. Like what is being taught does not correspond at all to what is being expected and I don't get it. Like why do they choose these ineffective teaching methods when students could improve much more if they taught us in an efficacious way??
What I mean by that is that first and foremost, it is crucial to correct students cause if they don't, students will never know if they're talking correctly or not. Second of all, we could have more writing practice, reading comprehension, listening comprehension - we had very little compared to what I used to have and I've only had 2 weekly classes with my previous french teacher whereas in university I had 4.. 
 

so basically in one year, I went from being fascinated by the french language to being discouraged.  So thank you for reading my rant,  please share if you have any thoughts or similar experiences...

languagelearning,"There's no rigid logic behind grammar rules, which is why it is impossible to become truly native like.","When you're a toddler you learn language mostly with your right brain, the place that governs feelings. So it was possible to develop a *feeling* for language. You don't understand grammar rules, you simply know by feel what is right and wrong, and what's miraculous is, your feeling is absolutely correct, just like every other native speaker of your language who shares this feeling.

When you're an adult the right brain becomes inactive and the task of learning languages is given to the left brain, the part that governs logic. You use logic to analyse language, but it's very hard to make any sense of grammar because *language doesn't follow rigid logical rules*. For every ""rule"" there are many exceptions (which basically makes the rule not a rule), and when you think you've finally understood a rule together with its every exception, you say something and a native speaker tells you you're wrong. ""Why is it wrong?"" you ask. ""I don't know why, it's just wrong."" And you are left feeling utterly confused and completely defeated.

Analysing language with logic is a meaningless and futile attempt, the only way to perfectly grasp a language is by developing a feeling for it. But as an adult, the feeling part of your brain has permanently shut down, you can rely on logic to learn, which is why you'll never be perfectly fluent.",1621059321,LanguageIdiot,35

I'm in a bit of a pickle and can't seem to make a decision, so I thought I would give some background in why I'm struggling to make a choice.

So first of all I'm currently studying a Bachelor of Social Work and I have recently decided that since I have the opportunity of being at university I would also study a diploma of language on the side. My main dilemma is I absolutely love both of these languages, but for different reasons.

🅸🆃🅰🅻🅸🅰🅽
My heritage is of a predominantly Italian background, but my mother decided to no never teach me due to migrating to Australia. I feel that Italian would be a good chance to explore my heritage and regain maybe some lost connection to my past.

🅸🆃🅰🅻🅸🅰🅽 🅿🆁🅾🆂
Going into the job field I am I feel it may be more useful, since there is a larger Italian speaking population in Australia over Japanese and has the same Latin alphabet.

Now with Japanese my reasoning is a little more selfish I have to admit, coz I've always had a keen interest in the culture also I'm a major fan of anime. More so I find it absolutely fascinating learning a whole new 3 writing systems. It's always been a dream to visit Japan one day.

🅹🅰🅿🅰🅽🅴🆂🅴 🅿🆁🅾🆂
I already have a pretty confident understanding of Hirigana, I have a loose understanding of Katakana and Kanji I barely know at all. Also my friend is already studying Japanese and said we could share our textbooks and study together of ai decided to go with Japanese.

I'm currently leaning more to Italian, since I'm near finished writing this, but it would mean a lot to hear your thoughts.

languagelearning,Tips for remembering grammar?,"Okay so I made a post similar to this one about 9 months ago. But my problems have changed slightly and I still (unfortunately) need guidance from my fellow language learners. Before I tell you what my issue is, I think I should tell you about my learning experience so far.

I've been studying Korean for about 3 years now. Unfortunately I haven't been consistent with my studying because I rely on motivation (which I'm trying to focus on and fix, don't worry) and since I lose motivation easily, my study ""routine"" doesn't last long. (Like I said before, I'm working on it) Anyways, because I don't always study everyday, my Korean isn't where I want it to be. I can understand basic sentences fine. And I think I know enough basic grammar to get through a simple conversation. However, I feel a huge gap between my speaking, and understanding skills. I don't have any native Korean speaker to talk to so I (sometimes) talk to myself or my family in Korean so that I can practice. 

To try to wane this gap between my speaking skills and my understanding skills, i've tried multiple times to keep a ""Korean diary"" so that I can practice using my grammar and vocab. My issue is that I can read and understand a ""decent"" amount of sentences that I come across, and I KNOW the grammar. But when I try to sit down and write in my diary, my head goes blank. I have an EXTREMELY hard time recalling grammar to my mind (I don't really have this issue with vocab though. I just have a limited vocabulary so sometimes I won't know the right word to say) . It's really frustrating and it's extremely painful to sit looking at a blank page forever. So then, I go to translate a sentence. For example ""I had a good day"" When I look at the translated sentence I can completely understand it but I cannot for the life of me get it out myself. I don't know what to do.

I know there will be some folks that will say ""You need to get a language partner"" or ""You should attend a class"" but given my circumstances, I can't afford a class, and we're in a pandemic so I can't meet new people right now. I hope some of you kind souls can give me some advice. I really love this language, but I am always discouraging myself and I have more obstacles than successes.",1621046128,soundofserene,19
languagelearning,Happy to have reached a good level in my TL,"I have been learning Taiwanese Hokkien for the last 8 months to connect with my grandmother in her native language, and I got to say it feels really good being able to speak with her now. Before, I could only speak to my grandma in Mandarin, but even my Mandarin skills were lacking. I remember going on a walk with her the first day she moved in here and struggling to get my point across. After a few months of daily talking, my Mandarin improved greatly. But I was still hearing my Mom and everyone on the phone speaking Taiwanese with my Grandma, so I decided to start really studying the language from scratch to connect with her and my culture. Today on my walk with my Grandma, I mentally challenged myself to only speak in Taiwanese, and I was so shocked at how much I could actually converse with her! I remember just starting out and thinking like, I can't wait until I can speak with her and have conversations, and now I can??

languagelearning,Happy to have reached a good level in my TL :),"I have been learning Taiwanese Hokkien for the last 8 months to connect with my grandmother in her native language, and I got to say it feels really good being able to speak with her now. Before, I could only speak to my grandma in Mandarin, but even my Mandarin skills were lacking. I remember going on a walk with her the first day she moved in here and struggling to get my point across. After a few months of daily talking, my Mandarin improved greatly. But I was still hearing my Mom and everyone on the phone speaking Taiwanese with my Grandma, so I decided to start really studying the language from scratch to connect with her and my culture. Today on my walk with my Grandma, I mentally challenged myself to only speak in Taiwanese, and I was so shocked at how much I could actually converse with her! I remember just starting out and thinking like, I can't wait until I can speak with her and have conversations, and now I can?? It felt so good, speaking in this beautiful language with my Grandma, which reminded me what language learning is about for me.

It's an offline English dictionary with a focus on a clean and simple to use UI. I think it will be useful to anyone learning the English language. 

Unlike googling for word meanings ,it's easier with the app to keep  track of the words. You can star individual word meanings which will  show up in the starred section. This can be a very useful tool which can  help in  improving ones vocabulary. 

I'm using Wordnet 3.1 as the dictionary database and the app is fully offline.The UI is clean and simple, and designed with one  hand use in mind.

languagelearning,"What is the ""proper"" way to structure an essay for the CPE (C2) Exam?","I am doing my CPE tomorrow and for some reason this confusion has only started to appear today. Throughout my studies I always thought the structure should be like the following:

- **Introduction** 
- **Summary arguments of Text 1**
- **Summary arguments of Text 2**
- **Opinion**
- **Conclusion** 

I will be presented 2 texts on a certain topic and will have to write an essay based on that. But is the Opinion paragraph necessary? I have seen sources that omit that paragraph altogether.

On top of that I am also unsure about the introduction: Some sources say the introduction should only be 1 line long (i.e.: The two texts both provide their own views on the staggering use of sunlight for energy production) while others say it should be more of a paragraph in itself where you outline the context (i.e.: Fossil fuels have long been a controversial subject of conversation. Climate change has started taking its toll on earth and society at large is responsible for this manmade issue. As alternatives emerge we should not overlook the usage of sunlight, which might be the best substitude for energy production.)

languagelearning,German or Russian for University?,"Hi! I'm trying to decide whether I should take German or Russian classes this fall.

For context, I'm currently a senior in high school, and I will be attending NYU this fall. My high school was pretty limited with language options, so I've only ever taken Spanish classes. I've done 6.5 years of it, including AP and IB, and I can pretty much speak fluently. Because of this, I don't want to continue taking it in college, and instead branch out and learn something new.

I've narrowed it down to either German or Russian. I'm the daughter of a Polish immigrant, but that side of the family all speaks Polish, so it's not like learning Russian would be a personal thing, and I don't speak enough Polish to have a 'head start' on Russian. It would help me communicate with family, but only by a small amount. Most my family dislikes the Russians anyways. I've always had an interest in learning Russian, and will probably end up learning it on the side later in life regardless of which class I choose.

As for German, this interest is more recent, but I'm just as passionate about it as I am with Russian, if not more. I've also heard it would be easier to learn than Russian (it's a hard language, but being a native English speaker helps apparently), and as I am considering going into politics it may be more useful. I love to travel, and Europe is a bigger contender for traveling to than Russia right now because of the political climate (although eventually I would love to visit both).

I won't have time in my schedule to take both classes, but I am required to take one, so let me know your thoughts! :)",1620993667,gabbiepepper,41

I really want to start learning Greek. I used to live in Greece and I am really interested in the culture and history.

I feel like I have currently reached a good balance in my division of time between Spanish and German. I feel like I’ve made a lot of progress in my German since December and I can have an hour long conversation in German with my German friend and I recently turned off the subtitles on a German show I am into. There is still a way to go of course but I’m happy with my progress. 

In Spanish I’m at a higher intermediate level and I’ve really boosted my listening skills in both languages this year. 

Anyway, I do want to learn Greek at some point, the question is just when. My desire to start is strong but I don’t want my other languages to suffer.

Yesterday I watched some videos from some polyglots who are learning three languages at once and make it work. One is Steve Kaufmann and the other is Luca/Lucas somebody. 

I’m also not currently working due to health issues so I do have lots of free time to put towards language learning.

I try and listen to an hour a day or more in both German and Spanish and I have a daily checklist of other activities I do each day and then I do other things on top like DuoLingo events and language classes.

If I start Greek then my time spent on all that would obviously reduce for the other two languages.

For people here who speak multiple languages, when do you start a new language?

A famous Slovakian polyglot has said it takes two years to learn a language well but I don’t know if I can wait another year and a half before starting Greek. 

I’m also possibly starting a masters course in September and if I do then learning three languages would get tricky I think.

Also I already pay for German and Spanish lessons so paying for Greek also could get pricey unless I reduce the frequency of the others.

languagelearning,Blog post: Tips to Improve Your Vocabulary,"(originally from [https://oplingo.com/forum/t/3298](https://oplingo.com/forum/t/3298))

[Vocab is everywhere!](https://i.redd.it/iqnrk51szvy61.gif)

If you’ve ever tried to learn a new language – especially a non-Indo-European, non-romance or Germanic language – you might’ve realised pretty early on that one of the main barriers to fluency is simply the staggering amount of new vocabulary. With languages like Mardarin Chinese, which don’t necessarily have difficult grammar, the main challenge is often the new vocabulary. Often the hurdle to comprehension is simply an unfamiliar word or expression.

## How do I learn all that vocab?

You might have come across the oft-quoted statistic that [75% of speech is made up of only 1000 words](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44569277). Yes, this is a fact. However, it’s a statistic that can be misleading! Understanding 75% of the words does NOT translate to understanding 75% of speech.

### What’s wrong with that 75% stat?

For example, if you’re learning Chinese, you might come across a sentence like 去洗手间给我柱塞。 And if you’ve got a decent level of Chinese, you’ll understand the bulk of that. You’ll know that 去 (qù) means “go”, 洗手间 (xǐshǒujiān) is ""restroom"" and 给我 (gěi wǒ) means “give me”. However, you likely have no idea what 柱塞 is, or even how to pronounce it! (By the way, it’s pronounced zhùsāi and means ""plunger"".)

So, as you’ve understood it, the sentence means, “Go to the restroom and give me \[something\].” You understand six of eight characters – or three quarters (75%) of it. You know that some item is being requested. You know that said item can be found in the restroom. However, you have absolutely no idea what item is wanted – and in the end, you aren’t able to do anything useful with the 75% that you do understand. In practice, that’s almost as bad as not having understood it at all!

### So how do I reach conversational “fluency”?

The truth is, in real-life conversations, comprehension often depends on a few key words – often words that are NOT in the list of the 1000 most common. Here’s another example, in English: “The friend that I’m going to live with is a real penny-pincher.” If you don’t know the meaning of the expression “penny-pincher”, it’s really not going to help that you understood the other 90%!

So what it comes down to is that you need to increase the size of your vocabulary. Especially if you’re studying a language that doesn’t have a lot of overlap with English, like Chinese, Swahili, or countless others. A lot of your time is going to be spent learning new names for things.

Convinced that vocabulary matters? Then let’s look at some of the best ways to learn it.

## How do I increase my vocabulary?

There are a lot of words out there, but no one wants to open a dictionary and memorize it from A to Z. And that wouldn’t even be the best way to learn!

A better idea is just to read. A lot. Reading will expose you to a wide range of words that you might not otherwise encounter. (See [this article](https://speakspeak.com/learning-tips/reading-to-increase-your-english-vocabulary) for some tips that can be used in not just English but any language.) [Fiction is vastly superior than news articles](http://testyourvocab.com/blog/2013-05-09-Reading-habits) in this effect, or narrative non-fiction, such as a memoir.

### But what if my vocab isn’t good enough to read yet?

If that’s the case, you’re not out of luck. Here are some options to get you up to speed.

## How to study with vocabulary “flashcards”

Originally, [Vocabulary flashcards](https://www.dummies.com/education/language-arts/vocabulary/how-to-make-vocabulary-word-flash-cards/) were – essentially – index cards (or something similar) with the foreign word on one side and a representation of it that you can understand on the other. As a learner, you look through these on occasion, constantly reminding yourself of something until it “clicks”.  There are many ways to make vocabulary flashcards. Wikihow has [an article](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-and-Organize-Vocabulary-Index-Cards) on how to make paper ones. However, these are the 2020’s, and paper may not always be accessible or easy to find! So if you don’t want to carry around a binder of notecards, are you out of luck?

Of course not. There are a variety of online options, or [Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) Software (SRS). Gone are the days when you have to dig up a pen and stack of index cards to make notes as you sit down to rigorously pore over some material in your target language. Here are some great options that modern technology provides:

&amp;#x200B;

* Anki is an SRS that is extremely popular with language learners. It is extremely robust.
* Quizlet is another SRS. Like Anki, it’s functionally is similar to paper flashcards.
* There are some language-learning-specific SRS’s.  Brainscope provides a number of digital “flashcards” for a variety of  languages. It allows you to make your own flashcards to add into your  virtual learning deck.

These and  a number of additional [iOS and Android apps](https://www.fluentu.com/blog/language-flashcards-app/) have the advantage of being easily portable – so that you can whip out your phone and flip through them any time without having to carry a stack of index cards in your purse.

### But I want to see these new words in action!

However, if you’re looking to learn vocab, it’s hard without context. Without seeing the words in a sentence, you aren’t going to get a good sense of how they’re actually used! And this has always been one of the pitfalls of vocabulary flashcards. This is why, more than just flashcards, actually using the language (reading, listening, conversing and writing) is required to reach a high level in any language.

Some people might try to simply plunge into material in their TL – maybe just looking up unknown words in passing, and moving on. Others might read with a notebook and religiously write down every new term. Fortunately, when it comes to reading, technology has come up with a happy compromise: reading tools.

The first of these was LingQ, with an extensive and impressive library. LWT, a free software version, came soon after. There’s also Readlang, which was recently purchased by Duolingo. OPLingo is a newer one, known for its hundreds of six-minute conversations with transcripts.

Reading tools help learners to track their vocabulary progress. For example, each word can be marked as “unknown”, “learning”, or “known” – with the language learner able to change a word’s designation as they develop confidence with it, and track the percentage of “known” words in each article.

Many learners that use reading tools like  to keep track of unknown words and review them until they become known. Others just note the definitions and move on. Either way, reading tools are dramatically changing the vocabulary learning landscape.

## Work on getting to 75% phrase comprehension (or more!)

In the end, achieving a high level in a language doesn’t mean that you’ve memorized hundreds of grammar tables and can flawlessly generate the past subjunctive of any verb, even irregulars. It means that you can understand most of what you hear or read without problems.

Understanding the flow of a sentence (or a story) is a lot different than picking one apart and dissecting it like you’re in an anatomy study! Reading in your TL and using paper and online learning tools will help you move from where you can follow, say, 75% of the parts of speech to following 75% or more of what’s said. Comprehension at the phrase level is what you should strive for. So if you hear or read a word that you don’t know, look it up and/or add it to your flashcards!",1620911382,OPLingo,3

I knew English before German. But at the same time, I am not a native speaker of English because I didn’t grow up in an English-speaking country and none of my parents are from one. So what is my English? I never learned it in the traditional sense.

This might be interesting to people here: [How to sound like a native English speaker: Tips, tricks, &amp; a whole new perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZyybg4BJeU)

It's a podcast episode by [Pronunciation with Emma](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNfm92h83W2i2ijc5Xwp_IA), but on her podcast channel. I think she made some valid points that work for other languages too. It's a bit of a slow start; if you wanna skip some rambling bits, go to somewhere around 5 minute mark.

In particular, it kinda made me think about my own accent, which changes a real lot, one moment it's British, one American, one Russian, even though I belong to none of those groups. That makes me kinda uncomfortable when I'm talking to native speakers, cause I feel like a fraud sometimes, not being able to use one accent consistently. Does anybody else have those problems? Her mentioning how her accent changed too helped a bit, so I hope the video might hold some merit for other language learners on here as well.

She also puts a lot of importance on pragmatics, which is something I've never consciously thought about, but seems like a good thing to focus on.

languagelearning,Letting go of the attachment to knowing the spelling of words—your experiences?,"I've been fascinated with languages since I was very young. Since I grew up in a suburb in a flyover state of the US, where there was no one of other linguistic backgrounds to interact with in real life, my fascination started with seeing [words and printed materials in other languages](https://www.aeempire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/12-language-suffocation-warning-bag-print-text.jpg). My strengths have always been reading and writing over speaking and listening, and it probably didn't help that I was only exposed to old-fashioned pedagogical methods for the first half of my life (or more). I took classes in school. I collected travel phrasebooks. I checked books out from the library (without audio).

Fast forward to post-college life, which I've mostly spent abroad in Asian countries. I get annoyed when I can't read public signage around me (I mean the letters; I'm okay with not comprehending), which has led me to learn scripts first. And when I start actually learning the language, I've always felt like I can't get the pronunciation right or hear the sounds properly if I don't know the spelling (which is exactly backwards, I know).

However, my recent experience living in Vietnam (2017-2020) and struggling with the language taught me that pronunciation and speaking/listening are the top priority—if you can't be understood and understand people in conversation, no degree of writing ability will compensate for that. (All the more true for an introvert like me.) 

So, lately I've started taking a different approach. Mostly I wanted to try learning languages through apps and prioritizing the spoken language, which is not something I have really done seriously before. I'm trying out Mango, Rocket, Memrise, and Glossika, focusing on Thai and Russian.

I tend to use Mango and Rocket in hands-free mode while I'm doing mundane tasks or going for my daily walk, so it's audio-only. Now, I have learned to read Thai separately before starting any coursework through these apps (old habits die hard), and I already knew how to read Cyrillic (not necessarily Russian) for some random reason. 

But I find that words I learn through audio, I can pronounce pretty well, but **I don't know how to spell them***.* In fact, I don't think it is possible to know for certain how to spell a word in these languages only given the sound (of course, English and French are this way too). When I go back to review the slides in non-hands-free mode, I'm often surprised at how much the actual spelling differs from my mental image of the word. I find that iPhone auto-suggestions are often pretty helpful, though it makes me feel a bit lazy 😅

I don't think I'm necessarily looking for tips or strategies. Just wanted to share this observation I made over the past few days, and was wondering if anyone else had a similar experience.",1620872881,tabidots,4

I hope to conquer German as well as many other languages in the future but as of right now I have been wondering how to appreciate the vocabulary of a secondary, non-native/learned language. Like when I read books or poetry in English, it is so easy for me to be mesmerised by how eloquent the authors can be. Or even sometimes listening to the way people are so articulate in the English language is so amazing to me. When I read German, it’s just words and only becomes beautiful to me when I have translated it. How do I achieve this same feeling of disbelief in one’s erudition and grasp of words in another language that I am an outsider to? 

TL;DR: I want to read books and poetry in original German and lose my mind over them",1620870955,ohnanashe,11

I have been learning languages mostly through sentence audio banks and listening to podcasts. I also do grammar workbooks. I have been wondering if I should add textbooks to my routine.

languagelearning,"""Wait, I think I'm a polyglot now?"" (hopefully a somewhat motivational story)","\[long post incoming...\] Being a polyglot always seemed like some faraway abstract goal for me, and when I first had an interest in language learning, I don't think I actually understood how difficult it is to actually learn a language to a high level.  I think I was more enchanted by the idea of ""being a polyglot"" than I was with actually learning the languages.  

I grew up with mainly just English, though I have Spanish-speaking family and also learned French when I was very little, so I was definitely aware of other languages as a kid.  It was not until high school that I actually cared to learn a language with the intent of getting good at it.  I took Spanish classes at school, and in my third year, I started doing a lot of learning on my own outside of class, and that's where I really saw my skills soar.  I discovered Dutch by accident on the internet, and that was the first language that I chose for myself and got interested in learning.  I used to present myself to others like I was so good at languages and knew so many, but when I look back, I was definitely wrong.  My level in Dutch was so low, and my level in French has had its ups and downs throughout the years (between A1-B1 haha).  At that time, my Spanish was mediocre, but definitely good enough that I could count it as a language I knew.

Around the time that I started college, I started to get more into the idea of actually getting good at my languages, and then I soon became interested in learning way more languages.  I had no set plan, and I just kind of did whatever whenever I felt like it.  The only language I made real progress in was Spanish, if I'm completely honest.  For the longest time, I held being a polyglot as some core piece of my identity, when in actuality, I was not a true accomplished polyglot - just a passionate learner who had a long way to go.

My second year of college, I studied abroad.  I spent time in the Netherlands, where I saw a renewed passion for Dutch and started to make good strides in my language journey.  Around this time, I started expanding my interests and deciding potential languages I wanted to learn in future, like American Sign Language and Irish.  I then went on to Spain, where I continued to improve my level by taking university-level classes fully in Spanish, and I had the opportunity to learn basics for Spanish Sign Language (LSE).  I have since forgotten most of the LSE I learned, but I am hoping to soon return to the language.  Then, the world shut down and I was sent home.  This is where my real progress began.

Over that summer, I started getting into Irish, but I ended up having to put it on hold because of school.  I started taking classes in ASL at school, and I have continued improving my Dutch and maintaining my Spanish outside of school.  For ASL, I took ASL 1 in summer, accelerated versions of ASL 2 and 3 in the fall, and am now taking ASL 4.  It was not until just the other day that I realized just how much I am able to talk about in ASL in only 10-11 months of learning, with the large majority of my progress being in the past 4-5 months with my current teacher.  That realization got me thinking about just how much progress I've made in terms of language learning in the past 2 years alone: I got my Spanish from a B2+ to a C2, that has only fallen back to a C1(+) due to not using it frequently, I got my Dutch from an A1 to a solid B1 edging into B2, I learned ASL from nothing up to a solid intermediate level equivalent maybe to a B1, I started learning a completely random language (Irish) from nothing and built to an A1 in a couple months already feeling comfortable speaking thanks to a wonderful conversation group with a few native speakers and advanced learners... This summer I have a lot of free time and am hoping to get back into Irish (goal of A1+/A2) and begin Cantonese (focusing mainly on speaking and listening so I can surprise my grandpa with learning his native language).  It's almost unfathomable to me that I made so much progress in so little time, compared to how long I spent making so little progress, and I couldn't even imagine attempting to learn two difficult languages this summer if you had asked me a few years ago.  Honestly, I can barely believe how much progress I've made, and I'm the one that did it!!

After so many years of calling myself a polyglot without actually being accomplished in more than 2 languages, it wasn't until just this weekend that I realized I've finally done it.  The level that I have in English, Spanish, Dutch, and ASL would probably qualify me as a polyglot now, but once I started making really good progress, I was no longer working toward the goal of ""becoming a polyglot"" - I was just learning my languages because I was passionate about them.  

TL;DR I spent so long wanting to become a polyglot, but now that I could be considered one, it doesn't really even matter to me.  I learn languages because I love it, not because I'm trying to impress other people.  Actually being passionate about what I was doing and having my own internal motivation was what made the actual progress happen for me.",1620866490,dragon158lhpt,4

languagelearning,"Lyrics in English are still relatively hard to understand, even after almost 2 decades.","It could very well simply be that I don’t have as much listening practice when compared to my mother tongue, but I honestly feel like it’s more than that.

On top of that, enunciation doesn’t seem to be valued as much, and the voice is treated more like a musical instrument. Is there any basis for this feeling that I have, any research on enunciation in songs? 

I’ve come across videos like “weirdest misheard lyrics” many times for English songs but never something like this for portuguese (though I’m sure I could find something similar). Mishearing lyrics seems to be more common in English, even for native speakers, at least anecdotally.

languagelearning,"""Deep"" or ""wide"" language learning when it comes to language families.","Hi learners of multiple languages,

I wanted to have a discussion on the relationship between the different languages we speak/learn. In my question ""deep"" means learning multiple languages that are closely related or all in one family. And ""wide"" would be learning languages from a variety of different and seemingly less related families.

For example, right now I'm learning Turkish. I am so amazed by the entire Turkic family, especially many of the languages within the various republics of Russia. I feel like I could spend my next few years just doing a deep dive in the Turkic family. I'm also interested in the shared history Turkish has with languages like Arabic (basic knowledge) and Persian. If I were to learn Persian I would really then want to delve (long term) into other languages like Urdu (and subsequently more languages from the Indian subcontinent).

I want to hear some of your experiences in unravelling the various threads that make up the larger linguistic tapestry. Have you studied ""deep"" or ""wide""? Did you start with one language and then finally immerse yourself in a completely different family? 

I'm not really asking if there's a better or worse way to do things but rather, how you've moved in your language learning journey with respect to related languages.  


All the best and thanks for engaging me in this discussion! :)",1620823335,MustheMartian,25

I can speak my TL to my teacher for hours because it's necessary for class, and if I'm outside the foreigner part of town I can use my TL to get what I want. My pronounciation is not perfect but it's not terrible. It's better than 95% of foreigners I know, but I'm often still misunderstood or have to repeat myself.

I can watch a movie or read a facebook post in my TL and summarize it in English, and yet I feel uncomfortable speaking in my TL if the situation doesn't require it.

Basically, if I'm speaking to someone whose English is better than my TL, then I feel disingenuious trying to use my TL. There's times where I'll start speaking to a salesclerk in English but switch to my TL once I realize it's easier for both of us this way. One of my local friends is abroad but I've visited their family for a holiday and we spoke only in my TL because they don't speak English.

I've been in cafes in the foreign part of town where 95% of the staff speak good enough English, and I'll see some foreigners walk in and say ""hello"" in a really polite way to the staff, and a voice in my head thinks 1.) that's not a greeting that the locals use in this scenario 2.) you're not pronouncing it well enough. The locals still appreciate that they're using the language, but it's like I can't get this cynical side of me to shut up.

I want to speak broken sentences so that I can identify sentences that I don't know how to produce. I want to speak more, but I feel like if I can't say it like a native would then I'm an imposter. I feel like a visiting diplomat who reherses shouting ""X country is the greatest!"" in the local language. I feel like an american saying gracias to a mexican-american waiter. Like uhh dude, the staff speak English too. 

I don't have this problem if I'm in a rural part of the country where the shopowners don't speak English, I will try my very best speaking my TL because it's the only way to communicate. Or if a food deliver person calls my phone I will reply to them in my TL because I don't expect them to speak English. 

My gf is a local who studies another foreign language, but she's never experienced this. She's always felt comfortable starting a new language and saying broken sentences to foreigners who speak her TL. I can only bring myself to say or text cheesy non-serious stuff to her. I feel even worse about it because all my friends are speaking their non-native language (English) to me and I can't bring myself to reply in their native language.

Has anybody experience this mental block? My skill at producing sentences sucks because I never feel comfortable using it for (unnecessary) communication, only for classwork or when the other person doesn't speak English. Thankfully I'm not in a country like Singapore where everybody speaks English. I'd say 30% of teens here can talk to me in English. Should I study more? Should I watch and read more native content?

I have a question to those who are in relationship and their partner's native language is different from your own, but you started learning and speaking to your partner in partner's language (or vice versa, the partner started speaking in your native language).

So, the story is that I moved to another country, I started learning the local language on my own, then I met my boyfriend who is local, but we speak English between each other. We tried to switch to his native language, but I'm very shy to speak and feel like I know nothing :( I try to speak the language only to his parents, but it is very difficult to understand the spoken language. However, it seems as a very good opportunity to have a native speaker nearby, and I definitely learnt from him many useful things in the sense of language.

Nevertheless, I would like to know how you guys switched from English (or other second languages) to your or your partner's native language.",1620802494,venus-girl,20

languagelearning,Debating on whether to learn Italian or Spanish this summer.,"So I am taking the summer off from work and school to dedicate to learning a second language. I only speak English, but I am really passionate about the idea of learning another language. I have narrowed it down to these two. In the future I would like to come back and learn the other.

Here's a bit about my background. I grew up in a French culture. It was never spoken in my household, so I never picked it up, but my grandparents speak it fluently so I grew up hearing it. I have a bit of background in Spanish. I took formal classes in ninth and tenth grade, but I do not remember much. I recently took an assessment and I got a 60% on the A1 test. I have been trying to study more Spanish by myself in my free time so I understand a bit more of the grammar but nothing, especially the vocabulary, is sticking. 

I have never touched Italian, but it is my best friend's native tongue, I love the culture, and I would love to visit someday. Also, I just found out that my church is putting on free Italian classes every Wednesday this summer. 

I need some help on deciding which I should learn first.",1620788865,LPineapplePizzaLover,8

languagelearning,Why you’re not good at a learning new languages (Hint: it's not your fault) and why foreign language classes are terrible and have never worked.,"**A bit about me:**

I’ve been studying Japanese for over 20 years and I’ve started and stopped many times. During the same period I’ve learned Korean to a high level in a year and a half when I was in US Army at the Defense Language Institute. I’ve also taught English in Japan. At one point I barely passed the listening portion of the JLPT level 2 (before it was the N levels), but got around a 15% on the reading and grammar sections.

In Japanese I’m at the intermediate level and I’ve don’t feel like my ability has gotten much deeper or boarder in years. So I started thinking hard about the entire history and process of learning a language and why kids can do it so easily.

**Language learning from antiquity to 1800s:**

Prior to addition of foreign language classes in the 1800s the main to learn a new language was individual tutoring which was, and is, successful if done consistently by same set of tutors. It also greatly resembles how children are taught their first language. Repetition, immediate feedback/correction and using it constantly.

**What’s wrong with the modern approach:**

Foreign language classes were created when Latin stopped being a dominant language in the world and were based on the Latin grammar-translation classes they replaced. They have been an experiment in teaching ever since.

**Classes/Apps/Textbooks** suck because they can only sample a language; a word here, a topic there. 

For each topic they teach one way to say/do something. Content writers have to be like this because they need to be efficient with their time and energy. But that means it’s up to the student to learn the other ways to phrase things. To be adept (not even fluent) with a language; for every sentence you can speak you need to be able to understand (up to) dozens of possible ways for the other person to say the same thing.

Additionally in order to appeal to a large enough audience to make money they are made so generic even lawyers would yawn while reading them. A textbook that would get you all the way to an upper intermediate level would be 20 volumes and at least 7,500 pages long. I know this because that’s exactly what the Defense Language Institute created to teach Korean. 

**This is not teachers’ faults**. It is an inherent flaw with trying to teach a massive and deeply interconnected subject in a linear and/or repeatable way. Teachers do a great job with what they have. Unfortunately they have been given an impossible task with the tools available to them.

**Flashcards/Flashcard apps** suck even more. 

One word/phrase/sentence per card with no connection to anything else. They’re handy for remembering things exactly or the shallow content you learn from classes/apps/textbooks, but don’t help at all for connecting it all together. 

The biggest problem with them is the time spent learning to make them and making them far outweighs the value they add. To make a useable flashcard that has some value you need to make the contents 1 dimensional, stripping almost everything of value and making it far less memorable.

Finally they require personal judgement to evaluate if you “remember” the other side. It is difficult even for someone experienced to make the judgement call on do I just recognize this or am I actually recalling it correctly. It is impossible to make an objective right/wrong call unless using fill-in-the blank/cloze or single word front/back cards.

Still flashcards are very attractive because once created they are easy to organize and track.

**Dictionaries** are great for looking up words or characters, if you already know what to look for.

They are a pain in the butt if you don’t know the reading of a character or what the dictionary form of a word might be. And even worse if you don’t know multiple characters, it is a compound word, or it is slang.

**Google translate** is the opposite of a dictionary it’s great for getting the gist of paragraphs and sentences.

For anything else, like shorter the snippet or more colloquial phrases, the results quickly become unreliable at best.

**Okay, so what can we do about it?**

The commonly suggested ways around the problems above are some combination of immersion, extensive reading, consuming as much content as possible and doing as much speaking as possible. And the inevitable “But everyone learns differently so try it and see what works for you” disclaimer. Which just means to me that, “I’ve gotten some value out of this, but I don’t actually know how well it works.” 

From this and the above problems I’ve tried to distill what I think is effective about them.

&amp;#x200B;

* You need to have several examples of usages for each word to deeply understand it. And this goes doubly for verbs or other words that conjugate. 

With an easy noun you could probably get away with 3 example usages, but for a very like run you might need dozens of examples to cover all the usages and conjugations.

&amp;#x200B;

* Each example needs to be as different as possible while remaining understandable. 

So beginners would want shorter simpler examples and might need to hold off on more complex examples until later, but it doesn’t hurt to collect them for later when coming across them.

&amp;#x200B;

* When reviewing a word you should pick a different example each time. Ideally reviews should be done by turning it into an exercise like fill-in-the-blank or other correct/incorrect exercises where judgement doesn’t play a role.

A nice side effect of this that by reviewing example sentences you review every word in the sentence not just the focus word.

&amp;#x200B;

* The easiest way to collect example sentences is by doing things in the language. 

When reading, watching, listening, gaming, etc. a really nice thing is that an authors/writers vocabulary is big, but very repetitive so the number of new words in additional works is very small compared to the first one.

""This is a subreddit for anybody interested in the pursuit of languages. All are welcome, whether beginner or polyglot.""

So what's being compared is ""beginner"" and ""polyglot"". They are presented as two extremes on the same spectrum. So what could we conclude from this? You start as a beginner and the end goal is to be a polyglot? I don't think that's the goal of most people here, and I certainly don't think that should be the mindset of someone starting out. I'd say that being a ""polyglot"" is not the pinnacle of success as a language learner. What it could say instead, ""All are welcome, whether beginner or expert."" At least use a term that includes those who have only studied one or two languages, but to an advanced level, who actually help others with hard questions. A goal that anyone should want to obtain. Nothing against polyglots, they're experts in their own right but they're not the epidemy of success.

I thought I would try but in the event I'm terribly wrong, I don't wanna stifle learning of another. I know it's extremely dumb to ask this.","
Question 
‎Does ‘I would go to the party tomorrow’ mean ‘I will perhaps go to the party’?


My answer 

I would go to the party- is the conditionnel tense so  or I would go to the party if ""insert condition""/ but ""insert condition"" 

for example

 I would go to the party tomorrow but I have to do homework or  I would go to the party if it's at a reasonable time 
 
etc so theres usually a condition which needs to be met for you to go to the party.

A better way to say the second one is "",I might go"" 

this is more uncertain you might go because you feel like it or you won't because you don't. it's a 50/50 chance whereas the first one says you would definitely go IF a condition is met like time or you can't go due to conditions like homework preventing you from going so the condition for going has not been met. 

the second one says ""I'll think about it/ I might go.

the first one is more ""you definitely would go to the party but you can't because of some other external commitment that is at the same time as the party.",1620751661,Judetherude,4

By 2050 [Vietnam](https://www.populationpyramid.net/viet-nam/2050/) will have a greater population than [Japan](https://www.populationpyramid.net/japan/2050/), the trends of Japanese population decline and Vietnamese population increase alongside Vietnam being a quickly growing economy and market in Southeast Asia could potentially point to the Vietnamese language becoming a significantly more valuable language in the next 30 years.
2. Asians are expected to become the largest immigrant population in the United States by 2055. According to [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/20/key-findings-about-u-s-immigrants/) Asians were outnumbering Hispanics in regards to incoming immigrants between 2009-2018 and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Could language education in the United States expand to teach more Asian Languages in k-12 schools as the demographics and language climate changes?

What do you all think? I want to hear everyone's predictions and what they see as future trends and shifts in the language climate and community in the future.",1620747612,Xefjord,15

It took so long to review the new lessons and homework, there was very little time left to study vocab or do any other kind of practice.

Maybe there are some of us out there who are struggling to follow and understand real conversations in different languages. I think it is almost the hardest part of language learning. It happened to me as well as a German learner, since there are so many different accents they use not just in Germany but all over the world. They speak German differently in Munich and in Vienna, in Berlin or in Köln...

  
To solve this problem I started to look for online resources where I can do listening, watching and reading at the same time for better understanding. Then I found a website, called Interpolly, which helped me a lot improving my skills. They collect many types of subtitled videos which you can learn from.

  
How does it work?

languagelearning,"Learning not to take Spanish for granted, by dipping my toes into the French waters","I've been studying Spanish seriously since September of 2019. I studies for two years in high school, and a year in college. However, after a ten-year break, most of my skills rusted away. At the start of this process, I took a diagnostic test on [Kwiziq](https://spanish.kwiziq.com/), which rated me at low A2:

https://preview.redd.it/uyvl7c6rafy61.png?width=1480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5ed1f2af4c90f6ba392f39aee7edee9d8182fec

The thing is, low A2 is actually a pretty solid level. It was enough to start watching [Destinos](https://www.learner.org/series/destinos-an-introduction-to-spanish/), then YouTube, then listen to hundreds of hours of podcast and later hundreds of hours of unsubtitled Netflix.

I didn't realize how great low A2 is as a starting point until I tried this weekend to consume beginner French material.

I watched:

* The first couple of episodes of [French In Action](https://www.learner.org/series/french-in-action/).
* The first 10 videos in this A1 French Comprehensible Input [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXweyiR2fMMf-ZrjCNNKWoeq8L6tlSFUV).
* The [first episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaNqp4FXh-s) of Extr@.

My comprehension was shocking low: around 30% on average. I contrast this with Destinos, in which my comprehension averaged 80%+.

This was humbling for a variety of reasons:

* I dramatically underestimated the value of my three years of prior education.
* I dramatically overestimated how much being a native English speaker and \~C1 Spanish speaker would help.
* I took for granted how straightforward it was to jump into comprehensible input. Yes, diving into input is easy if you already have \~3 years of prior experience with the language. Otherwise, it is hard. In hindsight, it was pretty terrible advice for me to suggest to absolute beginners to jump into Destinos.
* I am more appreciative now of tools like Duolingo. Presumably if I'd been putzing away at Duolingo for a year or so (even for 10 minutes/day), I'd be able to watch the resources above at something like 80%+ comprehension.

Regarding French, I'm not quite sure what the next step is. I'll likely pause this little adventure for now and continue to focus on Spanish. But now with more appreciation for what I have and more humility about the learning process.",1620710599,naridimh,21

Just some maybe less than obvious things that have helped me through my years of language learning :

* Duolingo - Do this on hard mode, i.e. use the desktop version with the option to type everything in. It´s a lot harder and a lot more beneficial.
* SpanishDict - (Spanish or Spanish to English learning) The amount of tools on this site has increased a lot somewhat recently. The Spanish subreddit bans talk of SpanishDict for some lame and antiquated reasons, but I love their grammar lessons and flashcards. Again, do the vocabulary flashcards by typing (or speaking if you are on iOS) not multiple choice. 
* iTalki - Unless you are learning a less popular language, you should feel like you are getting at least your money´s worth. There are a ton of awesome tutors on there (for different levels of price) and some not so good. My first experience was not so good and I delayed trying to find another tutor.
* Lingbe - A free speaking language exchange but ON DEMAND. A lot of other free exchanges you have to arrange a time to chat with someone, but this is whenever you are available for however long you want (assuming you´ve earned credits by talking to someone in your native language).  ¿Why don´t people talk about this more?
* Reddit -  You should have your browser set to automatically translate webpages into your target language... including Reddit. Make those hours on reddit are working FOR you. Sometimes the autotranslate doesn´t work perfectly or the jokes don´t translate, but that´s actually just as rewarding if you can distinguish between what the autotranslate messed up and what you just don´t understand yet.

Every time i try to read something in the language im learning, i feel like im looking up the same words as before 

Its like, i recognize said word, i can remember looking it up, but i still dont remember what it means and its starting to get frustrating. Im writing every new word i learn down, and i go over this list every so often. (im also using duolingo, anki,  a whiteboard and my best efforts)

what worked best for you to remember vocab? im down for anything at this point",1620670148,rng666,4

languagelearning,Anxiety from adding a second language?,"I've been teaching myself Spanish for sometime. I can read and understand very well, but struggle with speaking as I rarely have anyone to practice with (yes, I know I can do a language Exchange, but syncing schedules or getting people to respond more than a few times has been a struggle).
My bf and I are tossing around the idea of moving to Germany. I don't think he's ready to begin learning (I don't know, ok. I can only focus on me), so I worry about delving into a new language without a speaking partner when I know how much it limits my communication in Spanish.

languagelearning,Starting a blog and a YouTube channel - what are YOU looking for?,"Hi guys!

I just graduated college and I finally have time to set up a rigorous language schedule (woo!)

So my plan is to start both a blog and a YouTube channel in order to motivate myself, as well as provide resources to people. My reasoning for this is that I have had a TIME and a half finding the resources I wanted when I first started out learning my languages (German and Mandarin) and I'd love to make that experience a little easier for other people.

I think that having earned a degree in Linguistics and Chinese will allow me to have good insights and hopefully provide helpful insights! I plan on giving tips on language learning for German and Chinese, as well as recording videos in these languages. I am also debating making videos for those learning English as a second language.

So my questions are these:

* Would you read a blog?
   * If so, what sort of content would you be interested in seeing?
   * Would you be interested in my personal experiences as well as methods?
* Would you subscribe to a new language learning channel?
   * What kind of content do you like?
   * What kind of content do you want to see more of?
   * What kind of content do you NOT want to see?

Anyway, not too long ago I became familiar with Glossika Viva, which is Glossika’s program for collecting native speaker content. If you are a native speaker of any language on Earth, you can create an account and record your voice to help people around the world learn your language. Glossika currently has 60 or so languages, however they are always working to add more and I have been told that this year they have been working on Afrikaans and Levantine Arabic, and I’m sure others too.

If you produce good quality recordings and they use your voice to help people learn, you can actually be paid for it as well. Regardless of that though, I still think it’s something that can be very helpful. Even if they already offer a program in your language, they still can use your voice to make the courses better and add more content

languagelearning,Learning Languages with Movies,"For a long time, I avoided watching movies because I thought it was an inefficient way to learn languages. Instead, I watched Youtube videos where you're constantly listening to someone speak. In movies, there is a lot of silence, like action scenes, or landscape scenes. So to me, it always felt like I wasn't being very productive in terms of learning languages.   
However, the vocabulary in movies is often very different from the vocabulary in Youtube videos. When it comes to real-life situations I think watching movies is actually more helpful than watching Youtube videos because it's more about interacting with people whereas many Youtube videos are just monologues (depends on the video, I know).   
Anyway, I came up with a way to watch movies without feeling unproductive. I created a small browser extension that allows me to skip all the boring parts. ""Boring parts"" to me means anything that is not dialogue. I know for some people those parts are the best parts of a movie but when it comes to learning languages I want to be productive...  
So, if you like the idea, feel free to try it out, it's on the Chrome Web Store. It's open-source, anybody can contribute or use it to build their own extension.

languagelearning,Spanish Reading from B2+ to a solid C1+ via 50 books over 7 months,"Because it's sometimes interesting to read about another's journey:

**Main takeaway**: Want to know how much reading it takes to go from fighting through a Spanish novel to reading both fluently and accurately? It took me about 10 books before I was reading quickly and reasonably accurately for adult contemporary fiction. But truthfully, it’s taken me the 50+ books to really gain accuracy for Literature (and it will probably take 50 more before I get down to one new word/chapter, let’s say). There are a lot of words to cover.

**What I Did**: I previously did a seven-month listening phase which brought my listening from B1 to a solid C1. The spillover for reading took me from a B2 to a B2+, I would say. I decided that my next phase would be reading, so that is what I did.

I read 50 “books that counted,” which basically meant ""not kids’ books."" (I also read plenty of kids’ books, however.) For my listening phase, I was able to track my hours because Netflix did it for me, basically. Over seven months, they worked out to around 2-3 hours/day of exposure. But what it meant in practice was 1-3 hours during 3-4 days and then really focusing on the weekends. I take the time to say all of this because although I did not track my hours for reading, I kept essentially the same schedule. I also took a month off to learn some Latin. (Highly recommended.)

**How I Did It**: Again, nothing too extreme. I started with “Los ríos profundos” by José María Arguedas and was shocked by how slowly I was reading. There were also a fair number of new words--by “fair,” I mean a lot, actually. It took me maybe a month(!) to get through 100 pages. I think I should mention that it was a paperback, so lookups necessitated getting to the end of a section and then looking up the terms. I should also mention that “Los ríos profundos” is deadly boring. Oh, yes. I never finished it. I got up to chapter 7 and said, “Okay, I need something easier. Also, a book where something happens.”

That was the wisest thing I did.

I fought my way through half of a children’s novel (La niña que tenía el mar adentro) before stumbling upon the Mexican graded readers. My salvation. I started from grade 1, Generation 1960, and read and looked up every unknown word (that wasn’t defined for me by the reader itself) up through 4th grade. (I read about half of the 5th grade book.) When I returned to the children’s novel, it was laughably easy. And I was off to the races.

The books are roughly in chronological order (except for the children’s books). It’s perhaps hard to see, but I bounced among YA novels, kids’ books, and “classics.” Whenever possible, I listened to the audio while reading the text.

**Why Do I Say C1+?** Because this describes me at minimum: “Can read and appreciate a variety of literary texts, provided they can reread certain sections and that they can access reference tools if they wish. Can read contemporary literary texts and non-fiction produced in the standard form of the language or a familiar variety with little difficulty and with appreciation of implicit meanings and ideas.”

I am extremely comfortable reading contemporary fiction quickly and accurately. What do I mean, more precisely? I just turned to Gabriel García Márquez’ Noticia de un secuestro, the random pages of 196-200, and there was only one word that I couldn’t truthfully say that I remembered seeing before, although its meaning was completely clear in context (su corazón **amordazado** por los tranquilizantes). And at this point, I have read enough classics to know that I am in a good place.

By the way, I went back to “Los ríos profundos” this weekend and was able to read the same amount in two days what took me over a month to do at the beginning of this phase. It’s strange to see progress like that. (What was wrong with me? I have no idea how I had so much trouble with that book! Haha. This is why I want a record of my impressions.)

**Results On Other Skills**: Probably the interesting part, right?

*Reading*: Clear. What I appreciate most is being able to read fairly quickly--I know that I can knock out a novel in 2 days if I focus.

*Listening*: Not as much as you would think, but that was because my listening was extremely solid before. I do occasionally recognize a word that I’ve read when listening to a specialized news report, for instance.

*Speaking*: Hard to tell. I have noticed a few structures that I keep running into creeping into my speech that probably make me sound less natural, to be honest (“se puede aseverar,” “no hay lugar a dudas,” the verbs percatarse, espetar, puntualizar haha).

*Writing*: A subtle carryover. This is the weird one. Truthfully, I was expecting a more dramatic crossover because I remember that with German, after reading for a while, writing started to come naturally. I think it was that I had read more books over a longer period of time (3 years), so there was more to work with when I worked on writing deliberately during year four. Anyhow, you can see my writing over on [r/WriteStreakES](https://www.reddit.com/r/WriteStreakES/) and judge for yourselves. I don’t feel as comfortable writing as I want to be, but I can definitely get my point across.

**Where To Go From Here**: My next phase, given the results above, is writing! I will continue reading, but I anticipate the content to change: a few more classics, enjoyed more leisurely, and more nonfiction, which I miss. I have a few textbooks that I want to work through. I also want to reread Pedro Páramo, Aura, and La última niebla.

**My Recommendations (from strongest to weakest, although I enjoyed all of them very much):**

*Intermediate*: Aura, the short story ""Lo secreto"" by María Luisa Bombal, El chancho limpio, Nada menos que todo un hombre, El cuento interrumpido, La tregua, El marqués de Lumbría, Como agua para chocolate

*Advanced*: Pedro Páramo (this was such a fine aesthetic experience. This book alone is worth learning Spanish), La última niebla, La tía Tula, the first half of Las buenas intenciones (you'll know. It will suddenly start to get boring. That's when you should stop. It never recovers the energy of the first part)

I do have some experience learning languages. I took a few semesters of Spanish in high school. All in all it made me hate the language so I never wanted to learn it on my own time and subsequently I never wanted to try Portuguese because they looked similar enough. 

My family is very French and I live in New England which borders French-Canada so naturally I tried teaching myself the language. Oh my god I wanted to die. Everyone everywhere said it was so easy because French shares so much in common with English and blah blah blah. I found almost nothing to be the same except -tion words and the occasional word with the same spelling in English. Other than that, I couldn’t spell what I was saying and couldn’t say what I was spelling. I tried watching TV, listening to podcasts, the whole “shibang” but it just didn’t work. 


I’ve been scouring the internet for some assistance but I feel like I’m too picky. Here’s what I’m working with:

•I really would like to learn a language that sounds nice. That was another thing that drew me to French but we know how that turned out 

•Something that isn’t too different from English. I got lost in Spanish once they started switching all the words around. 

•Call me lazy but something that people tend to pick up on quickly. I’m a quick learner but when I don’t get something which blocks me from learning other things I lose motivation. I feel like if I made good progress right from the start I would be more inclined to keep going 

•Something that is generally fun to learn. I feel like when I was trying French and Spanish it felt more like a chore than fun

•Something that isn’t insanely hard. I know that’s probably gonna put a dent in things but I’m all set with tonal languages like Chinese or Vietnamese or even Arabic. Trust me, I love the way Arabic sounds and looks but I will never even come close to learning that

A show that my son is in love with is Masha and the Bear. We watch it in English and it's pretty cute. I've learned that it's originally in Russian, so I'm interested in checking it out in its native state.

However, the only time I would be able to do this is while my son is with me. Would it be overly confusing to him to hear the words completely different than how he's used to them? Would it impede his English learning in any way?

I know I'm probably overthinking this. I thought I heard a while back that if a child is going to learn another language, it should be spoken around them at birth, or start it when they're 3/4 and have a better grasp at what a language actually is.

Thanks!",1620614877,wolfgirlmusic,6
languagelearning,How to get out of the weird beginning stage when learning vocab?,I'm not really sure how to describe this so bear with me here.  I'm in this weird stage where I understand maybe 1 or 2 words in a sentence and I use sentence flashcards to learn new vocab. The issue is that most of the time the context sentence not only has the vocab word I don't know but other words that I don't know. So when I try to use the sentence to help memorize the word I don't have any idea what the things I'm saying mean. I'm unsure of what to do.,1620614620,Sudden-Dark,3

I am B1 in French but now taking the plunge into Spanish! Due to the practicality of the Spanish language (and personal travel interest), I plan to take my Spanish much further than I did for my French (goal of B2-C1 by Summer 23’).

1. Baselang Grammarless (until I graduate this and move to the Baselang Real World)
2. 30m Memrise
3. 30m Babbel
4. 0-60m (really depends on my personal schedule) of Spanish media 

How does this sound?! Any recommendations from those that have had Spanish success before would be incredible!

languagelearning,Where to begin?,"Hi there, I have stop started with French a few times now and can never really seem to build up much momentum with it. 

I am keen to learn but my problem is I don't know where to start. I have a background in music and I usually find myself practicing my second instrument in the time I could be learning French simply because it is the path of least resistance and I actually know how to progress - so I get more enjoyment from music - so I practice more - and the cycle goes on, and I never learn any French.

I guess I am looking for solid no nonsense advice. E.g if someone were to ask me ""How do I improve my woodwinds  playing?"" I would say ""Practice long notes and overtones to improve your sound. Play exercises in all keys to improve your dexterity with the instrument. To learn music by ear, slow it down (using software) and play along at the reduced tempo over and over and gradually speed it up. To improve your time - practice with a metronome"". It really is that simple.

What is the equivalent of the above for, say, speaking in a new language? I'm not looking for a specific resource - just a proven solid method which I can sit down and do repeatedly and see progress with my spoken French. The closest I have come to finding such an approach is this video: https://youtu.be/hin1HGhbGdo

languagelearning,Consciously studying vs forcing immersion?,"This might sound a bit silly, but I was wondering what other people thought of simply throwing yourself into content in your target language even if you don't fully understand it. 

To give an example, could I benefit from reading a book that I can only understand 60-70% of (without using a dictionary)? Or would I need to look up every single new word for it to work? 

I know some people that swear by this brute-forcing method and say it singlehandedly improved their ability to understand their target language, but it's not something I've ever heard of someone who's more serious about language study doing, at least not until they have more confidence in their abilities. 

Although obsessive reading is mainly what got me from an A1-A2 to a C2 level in English in about 3 years, there were other factors involved that make me question whether it would work for the languages I'm studying currently. However, I struggle massively in actually ""studying"" a language beyond the basics, so I'm not sure how else I could take control of my progress.

languagelearning,What to do about the United States' world language classes,"**Introduction**

It is popular for people to complain that they learned nothing in their four years of high school language classes because the *teaching* *methods* were low quality. I would argue that the low rate of success in language learning is due more to limitations of high school language classes imposed from *outside* the classroom than from low-quality teaching. This is not to say that bad teachers do not exist because they obviously do, but I learned next to nothing from even my *good* Spanish teachers in high school (and two out of three of my high school Spanish teachers were excellent). 

For the purposes of estimating realistic learning expectations, I have used Autolingual’s study time calculator, available [here](https://autolingual.com/study-time-calculator/). For the limitations below, I have based the information on my own district in California. Limitations vary in different parts of the United States, no doubt, but I hardly think what I have described is outside the norm. My observations are based on over two decades of teaching, but I am *not* in the World Languages department. I have not included AP classes when discussing motivation or homework completion among students.

**Limitations in the Public High School World Language Classroom**

1. Low motivation of students: In any given class, particularly in year one and year two classes, three quarters or more of the students actually have no interest in learning the language and are taking the course to satisfy graduation or A-G requirements. Many stop after completing their second year.
2. Underfunded classes: In my high school, the world language department has gotten no funding for resources since 1996, and the only reason they got money in 1996 was because that was when the school was built. The teachers have had to supplement with their own money and beg for donations. They are sometimes able to get some resources through lottery funds, but those funds are sparse and quickly snatched up by equally underfunded departments like performing and visual arts.
3. Disrespected classes: The classes are not considered a “core” subject and are often not prioritized during scheduling discussions with students. Often students are “dumped” into whichever language class has room, and if there are scheduling issues after a student has taken one year, no effort is made to resolve those conflicts; instead, the student is advised to “take a year off” from the language. It is not uncommon for a student to take Spanish 1-2 freshman year and Spanish 3-4 senior year -- a gap of two full years between the classes! 
4. Few options: Popular languages among teenagers like Korean and Japanese are not offered at most schools. My school has Spanish and French only. This leads to the low motivation already mentioned above; many students *want* to learn a new language, but they don’t want to learn the language they’ve been forced to study. 
5. Long breaks: Even if a student *does* take four years of a language consecutively, there are long summer and winter breaks that impede progress and necessitate extensive review each year. We only offer world language classes over the summer for credit recovery purposes (so, a student has to have failed the course to be able to take a language course over the summer). 
6. Large class sizes: Most language classes at my school have 37 students. That is entirely too many for each student to get the kind of practice and feedback necessary no matter *how* good the teacher is. Teachers use creative partnering and grouping to ensure students speak as often as possible, but that necessarily means students are practicing without getting the kind of modeling, corrections, and redirection they need, especially in the early stages. 
7. Study limitations: In schools where high school students are taking six classes, two hours of homework per class per week is the maximum allowed. In schools where high school students are taking eight classes, one and a half hours of homework per class per week is the maximum allowed (and there are fewer minutes spent in class each week to boot). We are not allowed to have homework quality or completion affect more than 10% of a students’ grade (though, obviously, a student who studies will do better on classwork and assessments), and we are increasingly encouraged not to score or give homework at all. When homework is assigned, my school has about a 25% completion rate, so only a small percentage benefit from the assignments. My colleagues in the world language department report even lower completion rates. 
8. Students not skilled in study techniques: Most students I work with have never learned how to study. Many rely on various cheating methods (a student who does all work with Google Translate isn’t going to master much of the language). The teacher can (and should), of course, teach study skills, but then that cuts into the already limited time students are exposed to the language. 
9. Limited time in class: In a school where students have six classes per semester, a student will have 250 minutes/week in their language class. In a school like mine that has eight classes per semester, a student will have 200 minutes/week in their language class. In an 18-week semester, students at my school get a total of 60 hours of class time. Take away the first week for procedural lessons, the last week for finals, and at least another week for time lost to field trips, assemblies, and testing, and we’re looking at **50 hours total** **in one semester**. In that amount of time, a student won’t even get halfway to A1! They won’t even finish A1 by the end of second semester. And then they’ll forget half of that over summer break, only to have to start at halfway to A1 in year two. After four years of study, a student will have only practiced the language in less-than-ideal conditions for **400 hours**. 

**Implications:**

400 hours of motivated, focused learning can lead to a decent understanding of a language, but when it’s spread out over four years inclusive of long breaks and done by students still learning *how* to learn (not to mention some students actively *resisting* learning and interrupting the learning of others), it’s just not going to get a student very far. In the past three months of studying German, I’ve put in about 180 hours, not counting any of my more passive activities like watching and listening to things well beyond my level. Since I’ll be able to get in about three hours of study per day during the summer, I will hit 400 hours *in less than six months*. I anticipate that I will have reached or neared an A2 level by then. But 400 hours under the conditions described above won’t even get a student to A2 in *four years*. 

**What is to be done?** 

Other than overhauling the entire United States’ education system (not a bad idea, but beyond the scope of this particular exploration), what can be done to make world language classes valuable to *all* students? What can be done so that students don’t leave high school thinking that they actually made a good attempt at learning a language, failed, and therefore “can’t learn languages” (an unfortunate conclusion many come to)?

I have a few ideas, but I would love to hear more. Here’s what I’ve been thinking about lately:

Make the focus of the class *how to learn a language.* Yes, the class will be teaching a specific language, but in the process, overtly teach the skills students would need to self-study *any* language. This might get the students who are bitter about not being able to study the language of their choice on board. 
   1. Give lessons about how to evaluate online learning resources: apps, websites, Youtube series, etc.
   2. Warn students against ridiculous language-learning claims from online charlatans that might lead to frustration and disappointment when they don’t reach an unattainable goal (not to mention bitterness over wasted money).
   3. Show students how to access free, high-quality resources through the public library and various countries’ free platforms (e.g., RTVE for Spanish, Deutsche Welle for German, etc.).
   4. Teach *how to study a language effectively*. Explain why I have chosen the methods I have for direct instruction in the classroom, but also introduce other effective methods so students have a choice. 
2. Be clear about the likely outcomes of completing all four years only doing the bare minimum. Explain that without studying beyond the hours of the class, they will only be able to do very basic things like greet people, ask for directions, and order food. If they want to be able to do more, then they will have to put in the time. Have students use the [Study Time Calculator](https://autolingual.com/study-time-calculator/) to set individual goals. 
3. Allow students to choose their own learning outcome track. Make grades be based on how well they meet *their* goal (but, of course, don’t allow goals that say, “I won’t learn anything”). Students can re-evaluate their goals as needed each quarter and will set new goals at the beginning of each semester. An example of the range of effort for various goals (the actual goals would include specific skills that would be mastered): 
   1. Track 1: I just want to learn the basics. I do not plan to study outside of class, but I will focus and participate during class to learn what can be learned in the limited time available. 
   2. Track 2: I want to actually be functional and comfortable in the language by the time I graduate from high school. I will study for a minimum of 30 minutes outside of class five days per week and will continue my studies over summer breaks. I will work with my teacher to set specific language goals each semester and build a plan to meet them. 
   3. Track 3: I want to be fluent in the language by the time I graduate from high school. My goals might involve moving to a country that speaks the language for college or work, or I might want to work here as an interpreter or in a job that would require working regularly with speakers of this language. I will study for a minimum of 45 minutes outside of class six days per week and will continue my studies over summer breaks. I will work with my teacher to set specific language goals each semester and build a plan to meet them. 

My truly radical idea would be to offer an “World Language Independent Study” course where students choose whatever language they want to study and the teacher, skilled in language acquisition methods, guides the students to the best resources and the most logical course of study. In multilingual areas like mine, it wouldn’t be hard to get mentors/volunteers from the community to come in and provide conversation practice now and again, and in places less multilingual, language exchanges could be created with students learning English all over the world. 

And... that's all I've got. What are your ideas to make high school language classes more effective and meaningful? What do you think of my ideas?",1620578043,LeenaJones,20

And oh boy, there's lots of different opinions flying around and i can't really tell which one of them knows what he's talking about.

I'd be very grateful if someone truly native could check this short text which i sent as a trial task and provide an opinion.

Also, perhaps hiring someone who was actually born and lived most of their lives in English speaking country is a better idea than hiring professional English translator from Poland, so hit me up if you thing you might be right person.

languagelearning,How to exit the constant loop of deciding which language to learn,"Hi All,

Looking for some advice, as I’m sure others have ‘struggled’ with what I’m currently feeling and I’d be grateful for advice on how you’ve resolved these conflicts in your own head.

12-18 months ago I decided I would finally learn a language, an ambition I’d had for a while. I decided to start with french as I had a good base from studies in school and college.

When researching ‘how to learn a language’ my eyes were opened to the non school ways of learning a language and that starting a new language from scratch was possible through self learning.

I also realised that I love all Romance languages - how they sound, the history of the countries they’re present in and general practical application through proximity to my home (South UK). My long term goal immediately became to learn french, Spanish and Italian to at least a basic conversational level and ideally at least one to a C1 standard.

I have varying motivations for each of these languages, but no one exceeds the other on paper.

My problem, I don’t know which to start with and I’ve found I have a constant internal monologue debating which language to commence with. I start with one and immediately regret it, moving on to another before the process repeats itself. I feel I’m afraid to start one because if I don’t follow through with learning the basis levels of each I’ll have made the wrong decision.

How have people dealt with similar personal debates and how did you come to a resolution?",1620575496,BTWAviation,27

It's great in that it's not just reading the pdf (conversations), but also talking about questions providing our own answers, which really pushes me outside of my comfort zone. However, I can't help but feel that I am nowhere where I wanna be in Arabic. I still feel I haven't crossed the barrier of being able to talk about whatever like I can in another language. Should I just be reading more? Speaking more? Listening more? Writing more? I don't know. I want to take this to the next level but I'm not sure the appropriate approach. 

My ultimate goal is to reach a C1 level. Right now I've been at it for about 4 years very inconsistently, hence the B1 level. I want to get into some sort of routine that is a little less reliant upon Anki. I wanna know if there is an activity that can be the best bang for my buck.",1620569770,Mystik-Palace,9
languagelearning,"Why do they say that it's better for learning a language to watch foreign language movies without native language subtitles, rather than with them?","I'm a native Estonian. When I was a little kid, I watched tons of english cartoons and other stuff on TV with estonian subtitles. Within a very short amount of time, I could understand english without subtitles, and by the time I went to school, I could speak to people in english. This is the way that (at least to my knowledge) the vast majority of people here learned to speak english as kids.

Now, I am interested in learning French. And to supplement doing excercises from textbooks and conversing with natives, I have decided to watch some movies/series in french - of course, with english subtitles (because i'm fluent in it, and estonian subtitles are very rarely available.)

Yet everyone is saying: ""That's pointless, you won't learn anything by doing that; either turn the subtitles off or use french ones.""

But this goes against all logic; I just don't understand how using french subtitles would be more helpful. I would have to use deduction, which surely is not more efficient than seeing the translated words before my eyes?

Could anyone care to shed some light on this matter for me?

languagelearning,One month until CAE.,"Quick background: I signed up late for my CAE exam (it is mandatory in our school to take and pass the test) and only have about 4 weeks left until the examination date.   
I myself find that I am quite comfortable with the English language in all categories, so speaking, writing and listening. I learnt English from a young age and had many friends as well as close relationships, including a girlfriend, with only-english-speakers. I consider myself to not be the best writer, but I don't think that I'm awful at it.    
If I watch a series or a film, it is most of the time in it's native language; English. 

Back to the main topic: I had forgotten that our final English exam (they just expect us to pass CAE) is in June. I have the possibility to delay the exam until September, but I'd need to pay the cancelation fee on the one I have already signed up for.  
I can study pretty effectively but I'm not sure if one month is enough of studying to prepare myself for the CAE.

languagelearning,Pod101 Lesson Notes,"Hi all,

First up apologies if I've missed this elsewhere, I've searched reddit and googled widely but not seen an answer.

I can't work out how best to use PolishPod101 lesson notes. I have been using a combination of Memrise and Babbel until now,  but having read the language learning guide on here I am now trying to add PolishPod101. 

It takes 10-15 mins to listen to a pod, often in the car. So first question is should I then stop listening until I've had chance to go through that lesson's notes? This seems a v slow way to progress but maybe necessary. 

Secondly, perhaps because I'm so used to being spoonfed via Memrise and Babbel, I just don't know what to do with the big blocks of text, grids of grammar and vocabulary etc in the lesson notes. Do I try to learn it by memory, or maybe transcribe it or make notes? How do i know when I'm ready to call one set of notes finished and move on to the next?

To my surprise, the aesthetic enjoyment of the language has either not diminished at all, or has even gotten stronger with familiarity.

Also it seems a new motivation has emerged, and that is the sheer enjoyment of understanding another language being spoken in real-time. Now I understand how people can spend so much time learning languages and call it fun.

languagelearning,"As a self-student, how would you attest a B1 level?","So I have been learning Japanese for a year now but because I am self-studying, I can't really judge or test my level.

I didn't really care about judging my level until I noticed that on my anki japanese deck I know 2700 words, so I decided to change the A1 level on my resume. According to [this link](https://languagelearning.stackexchange.com/questions/3061/what-are-estimates-of-vocabulary-size-for-each-cefr-level), 2500 is enough for a B1 level.

The thing is I don't know if I should write A2 or B1 as I can't know if I am a B level (independent user) . The only exposure to japanese that I have is like most japanese learners I think : anime and video games. But are these good indicators of your CEFR level?

Passive Vocabulary means that words we know &amp; understand but can't use them in speaking or writing. Active is words we can use them in speaking + writing + we can understand them. 

A native speaker can acquire approximately 150.000 - 250.000 words but sadly, most of them are active (60 - 70%) while Active only has around 10.000 - 20.000 words (the remain 20 - 30%)

My question is: How can we turn all (not all but 70-80/100%) words of Passive Vocabulary to Active Vocabulary. You know, use more enhanced words in speech and writing.

I'm a native English speaker and I am currently learning Spanish. It's the first language I've ever learnt in my life (except English of course). At age 26 I'm probably a bit late to the party, but better late then never. I've been learning Spanish a year now and would say I have a B1/B2 level (I've been putting in a lot of time and effort).

I'm a year into Spanish and doing ok, but I still have many things to learn. My aim with Spanish is to get to C1/ fluency (whatever fluency is lol).

Anyway, I'd like to pick up another language at some stage, I'm thinking either French or German. And I wanted some advice regarding when would be a good time for me to pick up my third language.

The reason I ask is because my main focus will be on Spanish for the foreseeable and basically I don't want the third language I chose to impact on my Spanish. For example, with French I don't want to start confusing French and Spanish. 

*So my question is when is a good time to start a third language to prevent this kind of interference?*

*And also, any suggestions regarding whether to pick French or German would be appreciated as I'm really undecided.*

languagelearning,The true story of someone who memorized the entire German dictionary (warning: LONG READ),"In light of the recent thread [Memorising the German Dictionary](https://old.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/n6wk2x/memorising_the_german_dictionary/), I decided to read up some more on a guy who did literally exactly that.  I thought his story was fascinating, so I'd like to share it with you all.

His name was François Gouin, and I first found out about him on Wikipedia.

From [The language teaching controversy](https://archive.org/details/languageteaching0000dill) (can be borrowed with a free account):

&gt; A century ago, Frangois Gouin went off to Hamburg to
learn German. He had been a Latin teacher while a university
student in France and he thought that the quickest way to
master German would be to memorize a German grammar
book and a table of the 248 irregular German verbs. It took
him only ten days of concentrated effort to do this in the
isolation of his room. Proud of his accomplishment he
hurried to the academy to test his new power in German.
""But alas!"" he writes, ""in vain did I strain my ears; in vain
my eye strove to interpret the slightest movements of the lips
of the professor; in vain I passed from the first class room to
a second; not a word, not a single word would penetrate to
my understanding. Nay, more than this, I did not even
distinguish a single one of the grammatical forms so newly
studied; I did not recognize even a single one of the irregular
verbs just freshly learnt, though they must certainly have
fallen in crowds from the lips of the speaker"" 

&gt;  It took him eight days to memorize the 800
roots and to digest again the grammar book and 248 irregular
""l thought I really possessed the
verbs. This time, he says,
foundations of the language, as well as the laws and the secret
of its forms, regular and irregular. But the result was
the same as before: at the academy he understood not one
word.

&gt; Up to this time he had isolated himself from the people
around him and he thought now that he should try to learn
the language through making conversation. He lived with a
hairdresser, and he tried to listen to the conversation of the
customers. Occasionally he pronounced a carefully prepared
sentence, constructed with the aid of his roots and grammar,
but these sentences always caused the customers to laugh.
This process of language learning was very painful, and did
not seem very effective. So he returned to his books in
solitude.

&gt; ""There still remained one last method,"" Gouin tells us,
""but one so strange, so extraordinary, so unusual—I might
say, so heroic—that I hardly dared propose it to myself. This
supreme means was nothing else than to learn off the whole
dictionary"" (p. 26-27). This he did. He learned 30,000 words
in 30 days. Let us allow Gouin to tell us the results:
The third week gave me the third quarter of the
dictionary; the thirtieth day I turned page 314, the last;
and more triumphant than Caesar, I exclaimed, ""Vici!""
That same evening I went to seek my crown at the
university—a crown surely well merited.
To comprehend what now happened to me it is
necessary to have studied profoundly, as I have since been
able to do, the question of language; to have determined
accurately the conditions in which mankind, infant or
adult, must be placed that they may be able to learn any
language, no matter which.
I understood not a word—not a single word! ... And I
permit no one to doubt the sincerity of this statement.
""Not a word—not one single word""

If you thought that was amazing, well, he ended up re-memorizing the entire dictionary 2 more times.  With no success.

Apparently he developed his own method of language instruction called the Gouin Method, based on observing his own nephew learn French.  It is supposed to be effective, but I am just beginning to read about it.",1620454626,Aullyn,13

I know the answer is obvious, German because I'm really supposed to learn it because that's what my family speaks etc., I really can't learn German  no matter how hard I try, is it because I'm just not interested in learning German that made me not be good at idk, studying German and knowing basic phrases??

languagelearning,I get frustrated and upset every time I try material in my TL,"I have been learning Chinese Mandarin for almost 2 years now, which I know is not a long time for the language but I have been at a B1 plateau for what feels like about 15 months, and I just can't seem to break through it. I feel like I am at the level where I really should be moving beyond textbooks but also just can't find material that is right for my level. Mostly I try to listen to the news and watch youtube vlogs, and while my goal in doing so isn't to understand everything that's said, I think I should be able to get the gist of things. Still, everytime I try I feel completely lost, not understanding almost anything. Additionally, I don't think doing things to make myself feel completely useless and incompetent is a productive language learning method. I know this is the millionth post about moving past the intermediate plateau, but can any Mandarin learners offer resources/methods they think a B1 learner can use?

languagelearning,I never realized how much I would love learning another language until I started learning one as an adult,"Admittedly there's not much purpose for this post besides sharing my observation/experience in language learning. 

I decided in December 2020 that I wanted to be more productive, and made an early New Years Resolution to try to teach myself another language. I picked Spanish, just because I took a year of it in High School and even though that was 10 years ago and I hardly remembered any of it, I figured I'd at least have a foundation there to start with. Today I reached 150 consecutive days of studying spanish via Duolingo, and I just wanted to share some of my observations and excitement about the process with people that would understand.

I was never the best student when I was younger, and I really didn't apply myself to language learning the way I should have when I took that class. That being said, being that this new decision to study Spanish was entirely self-motivated, I've come at it differently and begun to learn that I truly enjoy the practice of studying another language. It's sort of like putting together a really difficult and entirely mental puzzle inside my head. I'm missing a lot of pieces, but with each day that I continue, I uncover something new and realize: ""wow, I understood that,"" or impress myself when I come up with the correct word order for a lesson on Duolingo without looking at the options. I'm 7 sections into the Skills tree on Duolingo - one more to go - with 490 crowns collected and while I am no where near proficient with Spanish yet, I do feel like I've come so far. 

I also think it's forcing me outside of my bubble of comfort hobbies/routines of watching and listening to the things that I'm comfortable with. Yes, it's always fun watching The Golden Girls for the 100th time, but I've also forced myself to look up some Spanish language dramas on Netflix and started watching them. Even though I'm watching with English Subs, I feel like it's helping with listening comprehension in small ways. I'm on Season 3 of Locked Up and really enjoying it. 

I've been dabbling in other apps during this time too, like Clozemaster, which is great for learning spelling of specific vocab words. I put using this app on hold until I reach the end of the Duolingo tree as I feel like getting the basics of grammar is more important to me at the moment. 

My favorite app I recently came across is one called Lirica, which is centered around music made and performed by Spanish language artists. There are lessons that teach you vocabulary, and you can listen to the songs/watch the music video with English and Spanish translations at the same time. I love music, and this has been really exciting to find. I've added so many Spanish language songs to my Spotify playlists, and it blows my mind that when one of them comes on in the car, I can actually sing along to some of it/understand some of it as well. 

I know I have a long way to go in terms of listening comprehension, and I'm still scared to death of the idea of actually trying to speak the language out loud with someone, but I'm still really enjoying the process. I can see this being a lifelong hobby that I'll continue to enjoy, even if the target language I'm learning may one day change.",1620398084,fluorescent_noir,48

languagelearning,Not clicking with a tutor: Are my expectations out of line?,"I've been very casually learning Russian for about 8-9 months and thus far have been entirely self-taught. RU is my 3rd foreign language. With the first two, I was living in native speaking countries and just learned by living. I rarely studied and know very little of the ""rules"" with respect to grammar, but am now regularly and easily able to read novels and have full, enriching conversations with natives (especially in TL1).

With RU, I just want to casually learn and see how it develops.It would be great if I could reach B1/B2, but I'm in no rush. I do not have regular contact with native speakers and have no intention of hitting the books too hard, but I have been trying to have daily contact with the language. I have a tandem partner and recently decided to get an actual tutor but so far the experience has been pretty awful. 

One tutor is excellent and really took the time to get to know my level any work on content that is appropriate but is terrible with time and consistently cancels or reschedules classes. Another tutor is consistent and reliable but always seems annoyed and shocked that I do not use perfect grammar, cannot read cursive and do not know every word in the materials used (or 90% of words, to be fair). I genuinely believe this tutor is knowledgeable but thus far has never assessed my level nor asked about my goals, and almost seems offended that I am not studying hours a day. 

I find this absolutely baffling. I teach EN and the first thing I always do is assess a student, try to figure out their level of commitment and their goals. Then I adjust our materials to a level where things are challenging but still within their current capabilities. They're all different and all want different things. So my question is: Are my expectations unreasonable? Is there any benefit to sticking with this tutor? Did I get spoiled through immersion with TLs 1 &amp; 2?",1620391995,youcool_man,26
languagelearning,Memorising the German Dictionary,"hello all, 

Very excited to announce that I have recently finished creating a memrise course that contains almost every single entry of the Collins Concise German Dictionary. It's 15266 entries long and is designed to be completed by learning about 100 words a day over the course of about 5.5 months. I plan on starting it soon and getting the whole dictionary internalised by the time i move to Germany, hopefully in September if the coronavirus situation has improved by then. (Fingers crossed)

I've learned 100+ words a day in courses before and know that it is achievable. You just have to avoid classic reviews and learn through the speed review function. As the dictionary is from 1997 some words are eerily absent, such as das Internet, there's plenty about fax machines and telegrams though.  It has a mixture of individual words and phrases, and the best word that i came across was 'der Nacktbadestrand' (the nudist beach).

I've researched dictionary memorisation in the past and there was a lot of people that thought it would be a terrible idea when it comes to language learning, at the very least i thought it would be worth a try.

Also there is the case of a man who memorised the entire French scrabble dictionary, without speaking french, and managed to become the world champion at french scrabble.

The words are in alphabetical order, which I know a lot of people do not like, I however prefer learning this way as it feels more systematical somehow. Also, the only way that i could transpose a dictionary into a memrise course was by starting at page 1 and working my way through it.

I hope that this course is of help to other people, but even if I'm the only one that completes it then it will be well worth it.

And for those that think this is a terrible way to learn German, I assure you i get plenty other practice. I get listening practice from Podcasts and DW Deutsch, 'Mordlust' and 'die Spur der Täter' are great podcasts if you are looking for some comprehensible input, 'die Spur der Täter' being slightly easier to understand. I get Reading practice on [Lingq.com](https://Lingq.com) and Speaking practice on iTalki most weeks. Writing is the only thing I'm lazy about, I should have written this post in German for example, but I'll be writing essays in German soon enough when i go back to University to study the language, hopefully in 2022. 

I'm also considering doing this for the medical dictionary whenever I can get into a Masters of Translation course, I want to be a translator eventually, and memrise is the only effective way I've found to memorise vast amounts of vocabulary.

Here is the link to the course - [https://app.memrise.com/course/5949132/dictionary-words/](https://app.memrise.com/course/5949132/dictionary-words/)

languagelearning,Frustrated by my intensive course,"I moved to Barcelona with the intention to do my masters in October, so I've got a 20-hour per week intensive course for the next 5 or so months. I was really looking forward to it, because I've just started B1 and really hoped to be able to improve my speaking a lot.

Problem is, it's not a very good course. If I could quit without jeopardizing my visa, and if I could get a refund on the 6 months I've paid for I would quit immediately and just self study because that was so much more effective.

There are a few problems:
-the first teacher spends nearly the whole class speaking, so we barely get any chance to speak. And when we do, two students dominate all the time, to the point where it's impossible to interject, and the teacher just has no strategy or intention to deal with this.
-the second teacher has a better approach in terms of speaking practice, but he tends to spend a lot of time on things. For example, we could have a 10 minute recap of a tense we learned a few weeks ago, but instead we spend the whole lesson on it. On the flip side, things we actually struggle with don't get any time.
-the other students are just the worst. Some are really bad at Spanish, others are really good, and so there's this huge gap between people who can do things and people who can't. Also, none of them are even slightly interested in socialising, and they're all Russian except for me so even if they do anything remotely social it all happens in Russian. 
-I have tried to ask for an additional push or some kind of improvement when I've been really frustrated. But the second teacher is virtually unapproachable because he's quite rude, and the first one is lovely about things, but doesn't really seem to know how to improve his lessons.

I guess, I'm just frustrated. I spend 4 hours a day at this course, and I feel like I'm not getting anywhere with my Spanish or making friends. Then I get home totally shattered after an exhausting day, and I'm starting to not even want to touch Spanish in my ""free"" time because it's starting to become unenjoyable.

For background, my native language is English but Spanish is my heritage language and I grew up in Spanish-speaking communities.

I study anywhere between 45 minutes to an hour and a half per day. I start off by studying for 45 minutes every morning using this basic Spanish class on Coursera (I’ve found it pretty decent, although some of the tech is a little off). It’s supposed to teach me 500 words in Spanish I believe? Sometime during that, I also review the Anki flashcards I made using the words I learned from the class (English word on the front, Spanish on the back).

Then I go to work, sometimes during lunch I’ll watch this YouTuber who does fun Spanish comprehensive input, and I listen to the same few Spanish songs everyday.

After work, I usually do about 30 minutes of Babbel. I also am in two Spanish-speaking group chats (one is for work that I do, one is just to help myself learn) and I try not to use Google translate when I message in there. 

I feel like I might be lacking in the speaking and doing more grammatical exercises area? Although whenever I do my Anki flashcards I say everything out loud, and same goes for my course I’m taking. For grammar, I feel like I have a decent understanding but not enough where I could conjure it up in my head.

languagelearning,OPLingo blog post: Is Immersion Really Necessary?,"(Originally from [https://oplingo.com/forum/pp/12914](https://oplingo.com/forum/pp/12914))

[Is diving into language immersion the only way?](https://preview.redd.it/ydzv8a30njx61.jpg?width=635&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=791fc4b3aa9ef25cc2d708a7084a66a4c475a735)

If you’ve ever tried to learn a new language, you’ve probably heard about language “immersion” – probably touted as the best way to learn a new language. Maybe as the only way!

So what’s that all about?

## “Language immersion” – what is it, anyway?

Maybe you’ve heard someone roll off the virtues of this method. [Experts constantly tout the advantages](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/life-bilingual/201401/cognitive-advantages-second-language-immersion-education) of learning a language through full immersion. It’s also [championed by students of the method](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/opinion-student-blogger-the-value-of-language-immersion/2017/09). All in all, it’s generally agreed by the language-learning community that immersion is an effective way to learn a new language.

So what is it? In case you’re not 100% familiar with the terminology, here’s a refresher. The term “language immersion” means that, rather than study a language within your native language (L1) environment, you enter settings where the language is a necessary means of communication. An example of this is a home-stay with speakers of your target language (L2), where the L2 becomes a necessary part of survival.

The term “immersion” is also used in environments where, rather than being studied as a subject *per se*, the target language is used to convey other information. This commonly can mean using the target language for instruction in other subjects (such as a maths class taught in French). Particularly for kids, this method has gained widespread utilisation.

So that’s immersion. It changes a target language from being a subject of study to a necessary means of communication – pretty much how you learned your first language!

## Why is language immersion so great?

It’s a highly-effective method of language acquisition. Here are some of the recognised advantages:

* It forces you to *need* to know the language, not just *want*  to know it. With immersion, “you use a foreign language to do  everything, from buying coffee, meeting people, getting directions…” ([https://www.edweek.org/leadership/opinion-student-blogger-the-value-of-language-immersion/2017/09](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/opinion-student-blogger-the-value-of-language-immersion/2017/09))
* Immersion for kids is a great way to expose them to a  different culture. “If you want your children to be global thinkers who  are more accepting and understanding of other cultures, then language  immersion is a gift you can give them.” ([https://www.washingtonfamily.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-language-immersion-programs/](https://www.washingtonfamily.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-language-immersion-programs/))
* Unlike mere classroom study, immersion teaches your brain  to adapt to a new language’s patterns. “Adults who undergo immersion,  where they are completely surrounded by language examples, tend to have  brain processes similar to that of native speakers.” ([https://expathealth.org/healthcare/foreign-language-immersion-brain-processing/](https://expathealth.org/healthcare/foreign-language-immersion-brain-processing/))

## But is immersion the only way to learn a new language?

However, maybe you don’t have the time or resources to go and live for six months in China. Maybe you have ailing parents, or little kids. Maybe you’re lucky to get two consecutive weeks off work! If, for whatever reason, you’re not able to enter into a full immersion programme, are you cursed to never fully learn your L2?

Of course not! There are actually [quite a few ways](https://www.rypeapp.com/blog/techniques-for-language-immersion-at-home-without-traveling) that you can immerse yourself in a new language *without* having to actually travel to a country where it’s the only thing spoken!

&amp;#x200B;

* **Join an online group where ONLY your target language is spoken.**  These don’t have to be certified language teachers (though obviously  it’ll help if they are!) but there are plenty of groups – through  WhatsApp and such – dedicated to sharing new languages and cultures.  These are often geared towards speakers of other languages (often  English) so you’ll receive plenty of help and support from the native  speakers of your L2 – but ideally *without* resorting to translations into English to explain things!
* **Label things in your house.** It sounds  silly, but this is a great way to learn vocabulary. As you walk outside,  if you’re learning Russian you’ll remember that you’re walking through  the *дверь*, turning the *ключ* in the *замке* and checking the *ручку*  to make sure it’s locked! And if your language, like Russian, has  different forms depending on the word’s position in the sentence,  include these on the card, along with any genders. e.g. “замок (м.) в  замке” or “ручка/ручку (ж.)”. Do *not* write any English on these, though!
* **Watch TV shows (or movies) in your target language.** Here  is one method of doing this: watch it three times. The first time,  watch it with foreign audio but English subtitles, so that you  understand everything. The second time, watch it with audio AND  subtitles in your target language. You’ll be able to follow it because  you already know what happens, but you’ll be immersed in your target  language. Then, if you have time, watch it a third time, cutting the  subtitles completely. It’s as immersive an experience as you can get  from home!
* **Then team up with someone in your language-learning community, and do the “24 hour” challenge of** ***only*** **speaking in the new language.**  The advantage of this method is that it’ll move L2 acquisition from the  “want it” to the “need it” category in your mind. Temporarily forget  English, and you’ll be forced to express yourself and communicate  entirely in your L2!

All of the above methods are great ways to have a language-immersive experience without having to travel far – or at all!

## But that’s still all immersion. Are there other ways to learn?

Granted, all of the above-outlined strategies, while achievable at home without travel to China, are still, fundamentally, methods of language immersion. Are there other ways to learn a new language?

Yes, there are. And, furthermore, depending on your preferred mode of learning, and the time you have, they might be more effective! Immersion might not be the best way to learn a new language if you’re just starting out.

As an article from the Go Overseas website states, even people with the means to travel may want to opt for a tutor. “Trained, experienced teachers know how best to structure a class so that students can make progress in steps. They’ll teach you the necessary grammar so you understand why you say things the way you do” ([https://www.gooverseas.com/blog/language-learning-immersion-versus-classroom](https://www.gooverseas.com/blog/language-learning-immersion-versus-classroom)). Granted, we all learned our L1s through immersion. But it takes babies years to learn how to speak effectively. As adults, we can use well-guided study to shorten that time frame.

In the end, immersion is a good way to learn a language, but it may not be practical. Having an experienced second-language tutor may be a better option for you. However, if it is an option, combining tutoring with an immersive experience, such as a language-immersive classroom, would be even better. This will get you both the exposure and guidance that you need to become truly fluent in a second language.

I’m using Mexican Spanish as my Language 1 for the Portuguese course so I can work on both languages simultaneously. And recently I got the idea to change Language 1 from English to Spanish (Spain) on the Mexican Spanish course. So in other words, I’m seeing zero English on the screen when I’m doing my reps. 

My Spanish is decent enough that I only very rarely need to look anything up. And I’m learning even more ways to say things. 

I’ve seen Glossika’s justifications for using translation from your native language, and I get it. What I’m wondering is, am I losing out on anything or otherwise putting myself at a disadvantage by using this strategy? Am I losing out on anything by using two versions of the same language?

languagelearning,Learning Portuguese and Spanish,"Hello everyone !

I am a French native and I have been learning Spanish since may 2020. Over this year I made many progress. I am able to speak freely about many subjects with natives, I have a good writing level and I have an advanced level of understanding as well. If I would estimate my fluency I would say I am an upper B2 close to C1. I still have much to learn to be able to make more complicated sentence and I am not planning to stop learning. But I would love to start learning Portuguese. Compared to when I learned Spanish again, I don't have any basis in this language. So here is my question : should I start learning Portuguese as the same time than Spanish with my current level ? Is there is a risk that I start mixing it up or that it slow my progress in Spanish ? 

I have read that it is harder to study two languages of the same family. In that case since I feel confortable now with my target language should I try to go for a language of a completely different family ? Note that I am very motivated and I can dedicate time for study. I would also very grateful if you could gave me some ressources to start learning Portuguese. Thank you for reading me.",1620300277,presidentvaljean,7

I totally know that switching languages is a very bad habit to have, but I couldn't have committed myself to a multiple year thing if I hadn't taken a grasp at the two languages!

I really like both places (hopefully in the future I will live in one of them) and I have an immense love for Japanese videogames (and for that reason the possibility to play them in the original language seems awesome).

but what I've noticed is that Finnish seems so ""easy"" to me! I mean that not in a bad manner, but it feels so natural to me... obviously I lack vocabulary, but if I have a dictionary I can read basically anything without much problems! instead with Japanese it's the complete opposite, I don't know if it's the book that I'm using (I don't like genki that much) or the fact that I just don't like the split between 3 scripts... but everytime I study Japanese I always think ""welp, that feels so unnatural to me"".

languagelearning,Revival Effort for an Indigenous Language,"Wunya ngulum! So I was born and raised in South East Queensland where the Gabi-Gabi people Used To live. I had the thought a while ago that I should learn their language out of respect. After a bit of research I learned that while the Gabi-Gabi people are still definitely around, the language is nearly wholly dead; no speakers, very little recorded speaking, and I can only find one book pertaining to it and one of its dialects (the Butchala dialect, circa. 20 speakers), which I have found at the state library.
I am definitely not expecting anyone here to know a lick of Gabi-Gabi, but I was hoping that someone would be able to give some advice on how I might go about conducting a revival effort? For anyone outside of Australia, just know that the racism here is still thick in the air; a shocking amount of pakeha still consider the Aboriginal people to be animals, but that is a problem for another post. My point is that the culture, language, and history is not taught in schools at all, and so resources are dearth. 
I feel like if I can get my hands on all the material I find, and use it to start piecing the language back together, I can begin to learn it. I believe that if I can connect to the community, I can share my knowledge and give back to the people that once tended to the land on which I was born.
Thoughts? Advice? I'm honestly kinda stuck on this, it's very shunned to do really anything nice for aboriginal people, me being white and all, but I believe that if this can work, and the people can reclaim their language.

languagelearning,What concrete language learning activities do you do?,"Hello,

I'm very bad at structuring my language learning, and a bit paranoid about doing something ""improperly"".

As such, I thought it would be good for me to get a list of ""activities"" people do, rather than an abstract ""doing language learning"".

I found a nice book by Paul Nation on Language Learning, and he listed the following activities (I'll post the descriptions in the comments, I don't want to blow up the main post with them).

- Reading while listening
- Extensive reading
- Narrow reading
- Memorised sentences and dialogues
- Role play
- Prepared Talks
- Read and write
- Transcription
- Intensive reading
- Delayed copying
- Repeated Listening
- 4/3/2 (see comment, not very explanatory!)
- Repeated reading
- Speed reading
- Spelling practice
- Linked skill activities
- Issue logs

Some of them seem a bit goofy to me, so I probably won't try but others seem good.

So, having said all that, what language learning activities do /you/ do? Try to isolate and concretise them if possible, that will help me make a schedule.

Thanks a lot!",1620248193,JoshuaOC,21

languagelearning,How to get over the conversational plateau (Upper B1 to B2)?,"I've been learning Spanish for about 16 months and I can confidently have conversations of unlimited length about most topics, I can watch videos in Spanish (YouTube, Netflix), I text with people in Spanish every day and can read most things. But I also make somewhat frequent grammar mistakes and sometimes it takes me a few seconds to think of what to say. 

How can I get over that plateau and advance to be truly fluent? I know I need to enlarge my vocabulary and practice my grammar, but I'm not learning Spanish for school or anything. I just have a dream of living in Spain, hopefully in two years time. So I'm wondering if any of you have methods that are reasonably enjoyable? Is exposure to videos and chatting with natives enough? I don't live in a Spanish speaking country so I can't get more exposure than that. And advice would be super helpful.

languagelearning,Language Learning is putting my personality growth on pause.,"Don‘t get me wrong, I love learning languages. It’s hard work, but I don’t mind the slow progress. I love the feeling you get, when you understand more than you thought you would. Or when all of a sudden the word you‘re searching for first pops into your head in your target language. And when you can sing along to that song you listened to at the beginning of the language journey. I even enjoy doing vocab and grammar exercises. 

But - language learning has been stopping my personality growth. I used to read books, listen to podcasts, watch movies and so on. I still do, but in my target language. Which means I will either understand very little or read/watch stuff made for kids. This is stopping me from discovering myself and what I am interested in and hindering me to challenge my views on specific topics. Basically my mind has become very monotone. Now when I read a book in my native language I feel guilty and think I’ve wasted precious language learning time. Does anybody else feel like this?

I am frustrated, but I don’t want to be pessimistic about this. I am in way too deep to now stop with my language learning. So, I will hustle away, trying to reach a level where I can finally understand those fantasy novels and listen to political podcasts. 
Still...did anybody experience this and what did you do?",1620234756,dasistabertoll,89
languagelearning,Is there a business or service that creates customized Anki decks for a fee?,"I'm curious if this exists, but let me give a bit of background info about why I'm asking.

I've been learning a language for a couple of years now, and discovered Anki early on, but didn't really start working with it until recently.  I fully understand it's benefits, but I had always felt that the amount of effort required to learn how to use it and set it up would be too cumbersome and take up too much of my time, compared to using other resources that are already built and ready for use.  However after being stuck in the ""intermediate plateau"" for a while, I decided to give it another shot in order to make flashcards that are more targeted to my specific needs.

I'm also a full time ETL Developer, which basically means I import data into databases all day every day for a living.  So the ""programming"" part of Anki isn't that difficult for me, it's getting the high level concepts down about how it works, how to use it etc.

I'm in the process of creating my first Anki deck and it's a bit of a monster, but it's exactly what I think I need for my studying right now.  Bascially I took a show on NetFlix (that I already watched) that has dozens of episodes, then downloaded them all along with the subtitles in both my native language and target language.  Then used an open source app called subs2srs to split the video, audio and subtitles into chunks and uploaded into Anki.  The flash cards are now the subtitles and will have a picture and audio on the front, and the answer to be typed in will be what the person said for that scene/subtitle.  All in all it's about 25,000 cards/subtitles.  I think right now this will be the best way to improve my listening skills (my weakest area) in a way that's taylor made for me becasue it's a show that interests me and I'm already familiar with it, and that many cards should last me a while.

However, doing all of this though has already consumed several hours of my time.  I would actually be willing to pay someone to do all of this for me rather than do it myself if I knew someone who had the ability to do it, which made me wonder if there is a (reputable) business that already exists that does this.  If not, would a service like this be something you all would use if it existed?  How much would you expect to charge/pay for a customized Anki deck like this?",1620234391,skibblez_n_zits,12

Furthermore, they also offer podcasts and news in ""lätt svenska"", easy swedish.

languagelearning,I need some advice,"This time last year I started learning 
Russian and I was progressing well at it. I would say that I was A2-B1 level by July but when my school started back in September I lost the habit of studying. I still watch Russian YouTube videos and movies but I’m not actively speaking it.
One of the main reasons is because I’m studying French at school and my mother wants me to focus on that. In the last few months I have began learning French intensively and am improving a lot. The only thing is that I hate French and I have no interest in the culture or language. I don’t like learning it and I have barely any motivation.
My school doesn’t offer Russian as a subject and to get the college course I want after I leave school (which would allow me to study Russian) I need to do well in French in my final exams.
I really miss learning Russian and I am beginning to forget a lot of it.

languagelearning,What do you think of practicing language with other learners?,"Hey guy,

\- What are your thoughts on practicing languages with other learners?

\- I have a made a web-app which allows you to practice multiple languages with other language learners.

\- Personally, I have always felt that practicing with the native is not a good idea unless you are paying the native or he/she is super-motivated to teach you.

\- I hope that my app ([https://www.lingvo.cafe/about](https://www.lingvo.cafe/about)) is a useful to tool improve oral communication.

\- It allows to you practice with other learners via 2 minute video session.

\- In the app, you choose your **practicing language**, and then join the cafe,  and hopefully you are connected with another learner practicing the same language (assuming enough people are practicing).

\- Then a question appears in your practicing language and you and the other learner try to discuss that question in your practicing language for 2 minutes and the process can be repeated!

\- Currently I have included (**French, Spanish, Italian, German, Polish, Catalan, Arabic, Turkish, Indonesian, Chinese, Japanese and Korean**) as the practicing languages, hopefully more will be added in the future :)",1620148684,No_Effective7572,10

languagelearning,The Most Beautiful Language and Region in Spain?,"So i've been living in Spain for 3 years now and still greatly enjoying the journey that is language learning. Specifically, I live in Galicia, in the North-West of Spain - so more than only Spanish, I have been trying to educate myself on the local culture, which as I learnt also includes 'galego' (Galician). 

A beautiful mix of Spanish and Portuguese - it was difficult to get my head around at first, but more recently Ive been trying to at least more words to my vocabulary, something which is greatly appreciated by the locals. 

In particular, one word I hear a lot is 'morriña'. More than a word, its an almost poetic emotion felt by those who leave the region of Galicia and miss not just the region, but its people, food and even the smells. 

Ive fallen so in love with Galicia, the language of Galician, the people that I started a blog to show people. In the most recent post, I attempted to put into words my interpretation of 'morriña', from what many locals told me it means to them.

Thanks guys! Please let me know some of the lesser-known, charming language you've come across on your travels...

languagelearning,Does anyone have a book/series they read after Harry Potter?,"Hi all, so the post title basically says what I'm looking for. I'm kind of a ""perpetual beginner"" with foreign languages. Until recently I've been more interested in etymology and linguistics than becoming truly proficient or reading great literature, so for the past 5 years I've been using the same routine to learn my way around the basics of new languages. Basically, my process is to painstakingly work my way through the Harry Potter series while memorizing all the vocabulary and examples from a grammar book (something along the lines of the old Living Language books from the 90s) and doing a 1hr Italki lesson every week. I've been doing this more for the sake of fun/interest/relaxation than anything else, so I haven't paid a lot of attention to my level of fluency, but I've used this process for 8 languages now and come out the other side at maybe an A2 level (never actually taken the test so this is very much a guess) and conversationally... passable-with-an-understanding-partner. I'm the kind of person whose reading, writing, and technical understanding come pretty quickly, and then my speaking and listening follow miles behind.

Recently though, I've decided to push my Russian to the point where I can read the classics. With the help of university professors, I've been able to reach this point with Spanish and German, but I want to learn how to get there on my own. I'm not talking ""write a dissertation and engage in academic discourse"" level, but I'd like to be able to enjoy it casually and enthusiastically discuss it if I run into another drunk Dostoevsky nerd at a party. I spent 4 months with an adapted version of the plan above: pushing through a Turgenev anthology, working through an advanced Russian grammar book memorizing examples, and an Italki lesson once a week. PROGRESS IS SO SLOW. Unlike with Harry Potter, I haven't hit a point where reading became fluent. I'm still constantly parsing the roots of unfamiliar words and staring at sentences trying to understand how a particular case could be used in a given context. I'll have days where I only finish a single page or paragraph. It's just not fun.

##What I'm looking for:
So, I've decided I need a new approach. I want to find an ""intermediate series"" to read before I go back to my Turgenev. Something with a wider (perhaps older) vocabulary and regular use of more sophisticated grammatical structures than Harry Potter. Preferably a series that has been translated into a lot of different languages, something that's fun to read, and preferably not the Bible (it's an interesting book, but not something I can relax with). 

Some may say that I just need to keep at it and eventually something will click. I know that that's true, but I'm really not in a rush, learning languages is my downtime hobby, and I just want it to be fun again for a while.",1620097678,redwingviking,15

languagelearning,Should I take another language or just stick with Spanish?,"Hello!

I'm currently a rising college sophomore and I was thinking about learning a new language since I have a lot of free credit hours due to my major, and I was wondering if I should continue on with Spanish or just take something else entirely. I took Spanish for 5 years (8-12 grade) and got a 3 on the AP Spanish exam, which got me out of a couple classes in college. My Spanish-speaking is rather average, and because of an entire year not taking courses and also the pandemic cutting my Spanish class short, I am really out of practice, but if I took a course, I'd be in an advance one so I fear that I would be put in a higher level. 

I was thinking of taking French or German (my school also offers Russian and Latin), but I'm not sure which one I want to take. I want to live in Europe, so I could get by taking German, but also I think that if I took French it would be a bit easier for me to learn since I have a bit of background in Spanish.

2. Believe it or not but when I watch tv in the language I’m trying to learn I start with nursery rhymes so that it’s slow and easy to follow, watch kid shows, go to YouTube, use subtitles 

3.

4. Keeping a hour tracker so when I don’t feel motivated or that I can’t do it I look at the chart and see that I’m doing good progress and it gets me back to motivation

languagelearning,Should I pause my Japanese?,"What do you guys think of pausing a language which is harder to learn an easier one in order to gain motivation later when you come back to it?

My mother tongue is Serbian and I learned English early on and quite passively through watching YouTube, cartoons when I was a kid, movies and never really knew the feeling of successfully actively learning a language apart from German in school but that was involuntary and I did bare minimum for good grades.

The maybe a year ago I got into anime and started learning Japanese but frequently lacked motivation because it's quite a hard language. To be fair I'm above average when it comes to learning languages, with English and even German in school it came easy to me to be able to have good grades in German but I had no passion so I never pursued it. And even though it comes easy to me and even though I love Japanese and anime, that just shows how bad my work ethic.

So I was thinking maybe to start learning Spanish to build up my confidence as it is much easier, more similar to English and I don't have to learn new scripts which is a big problem for me. My mom is studying Spanish rn too so that could also help. And then get back into Japanese when I build up my work ethic and confidence.

If you’ve ever tried to learn a new language, you’ve probably heard about language “immersion” – probably touted as the best way to learn a new language. Maybe as the only way!

So what’s that all about?

## “Language immersion” – what is it, anyway?

Maybe you’ve heard someone roll off the virtues of this method. [Experts constantly tout the advantages](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/life-bilingual/201401/cognitive-advantages-second-language-immersion-education) of learning a language through full immersion. It’s also [championed by students of the method](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/opinion-student-blogger-the-value-of-language-immersion/2017/09). All in all, it’s generally agreed by the language-learning community that immersion is an effective way to learn a new language.

So what is it? In case you’re not 100% familiar with the terminology, here’s a refresher. The term “language immersion” means that, rather than study a language within your native language (L1) environment, you enter settings where the language is a necessary means of communication. An example of this is a home-stay with speakers of your target language (L2), where the L2 becomes a necessary part of survival.

The term “immersion” is also used in environments where, rather than being studied as a subject *per se*, the target language is used to convey other information. This commonly can mean using the target language for instruction in other subjects (such as a maths class taught in French). Particularly for kids, this method has gained widespread utilisation.

So that’s immersion. It changes a target language from being a subject of study to a necessary means of communication – pretty much how you learned your first language!

## Why is language immersion so great?

It’s a highly-effective method of language acquisition. Here are some of the recognised advantages:

&amp;#x200B;

* It forces you to *need* to know the language, not just *want*  to know it. With immersion, “you use a foreign language to do  everything, from buying coffee, meeting people, getting directions…” ([https://www.edweek.org/leadership/opinion-student-blogger-the-value-of-language-immersion/2017/09](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/opinion-student-blogger-the-value-of-language-immersion/2017/09))
* Immersion for kids is a great way to expose them to a  different culture. “If you want your children to be global thinkers who  are more accepting and understanding of other cultures, then language  immersion is a gift you can give them.” ([https://www.washingtonfamily.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-language-immersion-programs/](https://www.washingtonfamily.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-language-immersion-programs/))
* Unlike mere classroom study, immersion teaches your brain  to adapt to a new language’s patterns. “Adults who undergo immersion,  where they are completely surrounded by language examples, tend to have  brain processes similar to that of native speakers.” ([https://expathealth.org/healthcare/foreign-language-immersion-brain-processing/](https://expathealth.org/healthcare/foreign-language-immersion-brain-processing/))

## But is immersion the only way to learn a new language?

However, maybe you don’t have the time or resources to go and live for six months in China. Maybe you have ailing parents, or little kids. Maybe you’re lucky to get two consecutive weeks off work! If, for whatever reason, you’re not able to enter into a full immersion programme, are you cursed to never fully learn your L2?

Of course not! There are actually [quite a few ways](https://www.rypeapp.com/blog/techniques-for-language-immersion-at-home-without-traveling) that you can immerse yourself in a new language *without* having to actually travel to a country where it’s the only thing spoken!

&amp;#x200B;

* **Join an online group where ONLY your target language is spoken.**  These don’t have to be certified language teachers (though obviously  it’ll help if they are!) but there are plenty of groups – through  WhatsApp and such – dedicated to sharing new languages and cultures.  These are often geared towards speakers of other languages (often  English) so you’ll receive plenty of help and support from the native  speakers of your L2 – but ideally *without* resorting to translations into English to explain things!
* **Label things in your house.** It sounds  silly, but this is a great way to learn vocabulary. As you walk outside,  if you’re learning Russian you’ll remember that you’re walking through  the *дверь*, turning the *ключ* in the *замке* and checking the *ручку*  to make sure it’s locked! And if your language, like Russian, has  different forms depending on the word’s position in the sentence,  include these on the card, along with any genders. e.g. “замок (м.) в  замке” or “ручка/ручку (ж.)”. Do *not* write any English on these, though!
* **Watch TV shows (or movies) in your target language.** Here  is one method of doing this: watch it three times. The first time,  watch it with foreign audio but English subtitles, so that you  understand everything. The second time, watch it with audio AND  subtitles in your target language. You’ll be able to follow it because  you already know what happens, but you’ll be immersed in your target  language. Then, if you have time, watch it a third time, cutting the  subtitles completely. It’s as immersive an experience as you can get  from home!
* **Then team up with someone in your language-learning community, and do the “24 hour” challenge of** ***only*** **speaking in the new language.**  The advantage of this method is that it’ll move L2 acquisition from the  “want it” to the “need it” category in your mind. Temporarily forget  English, and you’ll be forced to express yourself and communicate  entirely in your L2!

All of the above methods are great ways to have a language-immersive experience without having to travel far – or at all!

## But that’s still all immersion. Are there other ways to learn?

Granted, all of the above-outlined strategies, while achievable at home without travel to China, are still, fundamentally, methods of language immersion. Are there other ways to learn a new language?

Yes, there are. And, furthermore, depending on your preferred mode of learning, and the time you have, they might be more effective! Immersion might not be the best way to learn a new language if you’re just starting out.

As an article from the Go Overseas website states, even people with the means to travel may want to opt for a tutor. “Trained, experienced teachers know how best to structure a class so that students can make progress in steps. They’ll teach you the necessary grammar so you understand why you say things the way you do” ([https://www.gooverseas.com/blog/language-learning-immersion-versus-classroom](https://www.gooverseas.com/blog/language-learning-immersion-versus-classroom)). Granted, we all learned our L1s through immersion. But it takes babies years to learn how to speak effectively. As adults, we can use well-guided study to shorten that time frame.

In the end, immersion is a good way to learn a language, but it may not be practical. Having an experienced second-language tutor may be a better option for you. However, if it is an option, combining tutoring with an immersive experience, such as a language-immersive classroom, would be even better. This will get you both the exposure and guidance that you need to become truly fluent in a second language.

languagelearning,Anyone else done this? (Switching languages),"I've been interested in learning languages for a long time. When I was 16 I started doing Japanese classes which I did for 3 years. After that my study was rather sporadic but I would say I got to roughly A2/low B1 level.

I did French at school but I wasn't that good at it. Because of where I live, I decided that French would be good to try to learn again as I'm in a much closer proximity to there than Japan. I've been doing classes since January (Beginners Plus course) and I'm due to finish at the end of June.

However, I still love the Japanese language and I have a more solid grounding in it. Ideally I'd rather stick to one language to learn so I'm thinking once I finish my French classes then I just focus on doing Japanese. My language learning is purely as a hobby for context.

I don't regret doing my French classes though, in fact I enjoy it a lot and I don't feel that I've wasted my time per se. But ultimately I think I prefer Japanese despite it being 'less useful'.

I am a bit of a polyglot (currently learning Mandarin which is language #7 for me). 

I am looking for an app that, as I learn various parts of speech in a language, I can input it in to a list of known nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs etc. 

Then the program would randomly create sentences for me to speak out.

So if my vocab so far was I, You, we, car, apple, eat, buy, to, can, will, want, a, the, it ... the app would create variations of this such as:

I want to buy the apple

You will want the car

We want to eat it

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I realize that grammar would be the biggest challenge. It would need to ""learn"" but perhaps tying it in with Google translate for a ""somewhat/fairly"" accurate statement could be played back. 

&amp;#x200B;

My challenge is I realize as I am learning lots of new vocabulary, I rarely get to use it during the learning process. Obviously this doesn't help with retaining it.

languagelearning,Advice for begginers! 📚🎓,"So, Whoever you are for whatever reason, You decided to start learning a new language, How fun! You daydream about being able to talk to natives, explore a culture you love and finally understand the music you listen to! However, You dont know what resources are reliable, You dont know what methods are effective, You feel lost and confused. Dont you worry, This post was made just for you! 

Now, There are few things you need to  know about language learning before we start:

1. **Language learning is a Commitment:**

A mistake I have seen many beginners make is that they have the mindset of ""Oh! I googled it and it takes only takes six months to learn the language!, Ill be fluent in no time"". Now, Listen, \\while you can make great progress in three to six months, You will probably not reach fluency. (Even in languages closely related to your NL). Language learning is a commitment that will take many months maybe even years to reach fluency.

You need to learn to set yourself realistic goals, Goals like, I want to be able to order a coffee in Spanish this week or, This week, I want to learn the past tense. Simple goal setting like this will help you greatly in the long term.

In fact, You will hear many of us on this subreddit say that there is no such thing as fluency, And, You may be wondering what we mean, This brings me to my next point:

2. **Know the language levels**

You may have had a peek at some posts and comments on this subreddits, You look at someone and you see this:

\[RandomPerson\] 🇩🇪 N| 🇬🇧 C2| 🇧🇦 B2| 🇬🇷 A2

What do they mean? Well, The flag is used to indicate the language, For example, You use the french flag for French, Uzbekistan flag for Uzbek or Irelands flag for Irish. That may have been obvious. 

What do the letters and numbers beside them mean? They are the levels set out by the ""The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages"", These are used as a reference to someones profficency in a language. They levels are:

A1 A2 B1 B2 C1 C2

You can call yourself ""Fluent"" when you reach a B2 level I would say. Be aware though, C1 and C2 levels are native-like levels that can take years to reach. Dont let this discourage you! If you want to stay at a B2 level that is fine, B2 level is a high enough level to be able to communicate everything you want to!

3. **Dont compare yourself to others!**

I see many beginners get discourages and loose motivation because they are not making as much progress as this person or that person. When it comes to language learning,You should never compare yourself to others. They are making more progress because they are on Stage 10 of their journey, While you are on Stage 1.

You especially should **NOT** compare yourself to Polyglots on YouTube. If you want to watch them, Go ahead, Thats not my buissness, However, Do not compare yourself to YouTubers such as Luca Lampriello, Lindie Botes or Ikenna. 

Language learning is not about the end, Language learning should be you enjoying the journey. Enjoy every moment of it, And, Have fun!

Now, With those three points made, Let me talk about the questions that plauge most beginners:

1. **What resources do I use?**

You need resources in order to learn a language, Resources come in different shape and forms, You need to find the resources that work for you, For some people its apps, others its teachers, others its textbooks, You have the freedom to choose what resources you want!

Personally, I think a mix of all the three mentioned above would be perfect, An app/apps are great for reviewing and work pretty good as a main resource is most cases, A teacher or tutor would be good for reviewing, but its not a requirment, You do not need a teacher or tutor if you dont want one. A textbook is always a good idea as most beginner textbooks can get you to a A2 or maybe B1 level.

I will list some resources for languages you can use and what you should use them for:

***Apps***

Busuu (Good material for beginners)

Lingodeer (It is a paid subscription but worth it, It is really good for east asian languages)

Duolingo (This does not make a good main source, Use it for reviewing)

Anki (This is a flashcard program that every language learner highly reccomends)

Radio apps (These apps are great for listening practice)

HelloTalk (A free language exchange app that you can use to talk to natives of your target language and you may get a bonus friendship from it!}

italki {This is an app for those who want a teacher, The prices are reasonable and the quality is high!)

Reverso (Dictionary app that gives words in context)

Dictionary app (In modern times, You dont need to waste money on a dictionary and can just find one if you just want the stand alone word)

***Textbooks***

I cant really list textbooks here as it depends on the language you are learning, Textbooks are reliable resources, I am sure subreddits dedicated to certain languages have some textbooks listed on their sidebar.

I also think watching media in your target language is a great way to get audio practice. Netflix is a great place to find movies and shows in your target language.

There are plently of other resources that you find at the sidebar of a languages subreddit, such as r/French, r/italianlearning, r/German etc. Look at this subreddits sidebar to find the language subreddit you want.

2. **What methods are effective?**

The truth is, The best method is the method that works for you, We are all different people and different learning methods work best for us, Take your time to find methods that work best for you! The method you find the best will always result in the best progress!

Avoid youtube methods as that is **their** methods and it may not work for you, Once again, Do not compare yourself to others.

3. **How long will it take?**

Like I said, Language learning is a commitment and how long it will take depends on the language you are learning, However, I will say it again, Do not set yourself the goal of being ""fluent"" in a certain number of months, Language learning shouldnt be about rushing yourself to being able to speak it, Slow and steady wins the race. Its about the journey.

**Conclusion**

I hope that in this bassically essay, I have helped you begin your language learning journey, Learning a language is truly fantastic and it opens may doors that would have stayed closed otherwise. You will be able to express new ideas that you would not have been able to if you only spoke your native language.

Now, With all that said, Go ahead and have fun learning your target language!

So, first of all, I don‘t know which subreddit is best for this inquiry, but I guess I’ll start here. Also, this is my first post here.



I’m looking into reading Dante’s Divine Comedy. I know it’s a classic and it has been on my list for quite a while, but I see there is a lot of debate regarding which English translation to choose, which got me thinking if English is even the best choice.

I moved to the United States in 2015, and for the most part, almost every book I’ve read in the past like 4 years has been in English. Frankly, I might even be more comfortable reading in English than Spanish, which is my native language.

I assume Spanish translations probably adhere more closely to the sound of the original Italian text, since the two are so incredibly similar. As opposed to English translations, which are probably awkward and clunky, and might fail to capture the magic of the Italian original.

In short, should I read it in Spanish? or English? and which translations are best in each language?",1620025442,Rossanred,8

languagelearning,Can I learn two languages at the same time?,"Background here.

So, I learnt french during highschool and I barely passed the B2 French certification , I admit I wasn't doing very well back then so I didn't spend too much time reviewing as I should. I tried to keep studying because the course only took me so far but I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

Pass forward a couple of years, I had to take another language so I chose chinese. Because I like pain.

I've been studying chinese for a year and it has been an experience to say the least. I've passed hours watching chinese shows, making decks and reading graded books - I can say that I like learning chinese more than french and I planned to continue so. But...

Well, some things have came up in my life and I'm at a standpoint. Learning French and getting at least a better B2 score could potentially give me more opportunities ,however I would have to put less time in practicing chinese which is something I much prefer. I've been trying to acomodate my schedule to learn both but I can tell my chinese has been suffering because of the time I've been putting in French.

languagelearning,Sports and languages," The link between sports and languages is quite strong, not only because sport is part of culture, but also because of the language itself.  
 Let’s take English for example. In the UK, the word “football” usually indicates “association football”, the most famous sport in the world. In Ireland, the same term can be used to indicate Gaelic football as well, which is a completely different sport.In the USA, the word “football” is used to indicate “American football” while in Canada it indicates “Canadian football”, two versions of a sport that is generally called “gridiron football”. In both countries, “association football” is usually called “soccer”. In Australia, the word “football” indicates “Australian rules football”, still another code, and in New Zealand it can often indicate “rugby football”.  
 So many meanings for just one word, amazing, isn’t it? What about the other languages? The majority of European languages tend to call “association football” with names derived from “football”: in French it is “football”, in German it is Fußball, in Spanish it is fútbol etc. One important exception is Italian: in Italy, the word “football” was originally used, but it was later replaced with the Italian “calcio”, a term derived from a traditional sport which was quite similar to modern football and was very popular in Florence. For this reason, it was called “calcio fiorentino”, that is: Florence football.Florence is the city where Italian language and culture had origin, so Florence should have chosen the name for the new sport. This was normal for Italian people.

languagelearning,"Best overall app, program, course for learning fluency","Hi there I am wanting to learn multiple languages but I do not know where to start.

languagelearning,Trying to improve my listening skills (please help),"So I’ve been studying Spanish for about 6 almost 7 years now, it’s my minor at school and I’m really proud of myself for keeping up with it as long as I have. I  have ADHD so language learning is a lot harder than it would be for a neuro-typical brain. That being said I should be at a higher intermediate/advanced (B2/C1) but due to my ADHD and covid too I would say I’m at a elementary/intermediate level (A2/B1). I have been putting together a lesson plan to catch myself up and strengthen my language, but omfg I have no idea how to help myself with listening comprehension.
 I’ve had people tell me to watch TV with subtitles or listen to music and follow with lyrics. None of this has helped, or at least enough to be noticeable to me. I can read, write, and speak but ask me a question and I am done for. For the most part I think this is what is holding me back the most and I just have no idea where to start or anything.

languagelearning,Anybody down for a 3-month language challenge? Comment below!,"Listen up language learning nerds,

**The Backstory**: I've been procrastinating learning a language for a while now. I keep flip-flopping between what seems like 300 languages, and I need to stick with a plan and be held accountable - hence, the 3-month challenge. I have my own reasons for learning my target language, and I want to finally be able to do something with it.

**The Proposal**: For those of you who have been procrastinating, not sticking to one, unsure what to learn, or for whatever reason have not been learning the language(s) you said you were going to, would you like to join me in a 3-month challenge to learn as much as you can? I would like to make a group of us ragtags to keep us accountable and motivated. Because honestly, if we don't do it now when are we actually going to do it?

**The Goal**: What I have in mind is to be able to have a basic understanding in your target language, and be able to construct simple sentences. If we're really feeling wild and exotic, we can even do a video of ourselves speaking in our target language.

**The Haters**: Before people start jumping on me about ""yOu CaNt GeT fLuEnT iN 3 mOnThS"", I'm not trying to be fluent in 3 months. I'm simply trying to get the ball rolling, and I feel like you can learn a decent amount in 3 months, given that you are consistent in your studying.

**The Resources**: Use whatever you can at your disposal. Apps, websites, videos, radio, music, other people, what have you. Anything is game, and we can all help each other with study habits, explanations (if we are familiar with that language), and resources others might not be familiar with.

languagelearning,Is it abnormal to not learn a language you've lived with for 4 whole years as a child?,"So basically, when from roughly ages 8-11 I lived in egypt with my mother who only spoke english. The thing is though, I watched arabic cartoons almost every day and spent countless hours playing with the arab locals just about every single day... As a kid, conversation isn't that important to the formation of a friendship, so I got by spoking a very weak arabic with english, and my friends would do the same for me. They'd usually speak tiny amounts of english, but not that much. Even the school I went to had 3 days a week where ALL the lessons were in arabic..

With all that rich exposure, I should have become fluent; but my vocabulary in arabic remained only good enough to ask for directions, meanwhile fellow foreigners who've barely spench much time in the country had more fluency than me.

Heck, Ive even met people who have managed to learn another language by watching movies with subtitles without even thinking about it, or trying.. Their brain just picks up the words..

So I've come to realize that something is seriously wrong with me.. The more I think about not having learnt barely anything, the more it strikes me that perhaps the language learning part of my brain is somehow disabled, or deficient. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this? I CAN learn language, but only if I intend to (which children rarely do despite learning), and it has to be super interactive (duolingo is literally the only thing that has worked for me, ever)... I could never just watch a tv show with subs and learn from that.",1619985323,Even-Ferret550,3
languagelearning,For folks wondering which language that they should learn,"If you're wondering which language you should learn, first ask yourself ""why do I want to learn another language?"". If it has something to do with what appears necessity, make sure that this really is the case.

1. Jobs: If you speak English, you're already way ahead of everyone else. It's possible to work in many non-Anglophone countries with no knowledge of the native language. This depends on the general English proficiency in the country, e.g. Dutch and Swedish employers probably won't bat an eye about your lack of native language skills but Mexican and Japanese employers might.

2. Travel: This goes with the above. Every year, it is less and less necessary to know another language than English for international travel. For example, don't learn French if you just want to visit Montreal or Paris and not a smaller town where English has not yet penetrated.

3. Romance: if you are with your significant other, then your relationship was established based on your common language. It might be nice to know the second language but it's not necessary, could cause frustration, and unfortunately relationships don't always last.


My advice is to learn a completely unnecessary language. Which language gives you access to the deep cultural modes of a people whom you deeply respect, along with literature, media, and hobbies that you enjoy? Pick that language. Can interests change? Of course, but an interest that thirsts to be ingratiated by the whole of its culture will last longer and surer than a job listing, two week vacation, or relationship.",1619983337,BillHendricks,20

languagelearning,I don't know if I have genuinely lost interest in a language or if I'm just chasing the high of discovering a new language (I'm considering quitting Russian and studying Japanese),"I began studying Russian last year, but didn't get very far with it. I have the alphabet and basic sounds memorized, and I am working my way through Pimsleur. Due to a change in routine I got out of the habit of doing Pimsleur and haven't studied for the past few months, but I listened to it recently and I retained a surprising amount of information.

I want to get back into studying languages but I'm not sure if I want to continue with Russian. Part of me thinks I should get to at least an A1 or A2 level in Russian before moving on to something else. In the past I have studied Spanish, French, Latin, and Italian and I gave up on all of them in the beginner stages. It's not a good habit. 

I initially became interested in Russian because I want to visit Russia and learn more about Russian painting. However with the covid situation that plan isn't working out. Lately I have developed a strong interest in anime and in Japan in general. 

As an English speaker, both of these languages are difficult. Japanese is obviously more difficult. I feel I have to focus on one of them and can't study both at the same time, and no matter what language I pick it will take a long time to truly learn anything. 

So basically, I want to start studying Japanese, but I'm afraid that once I get to the point where it gets difficult I will want to give up again because I have bad study habits and I'm not good at pushing through things. I don't know if I should push through Russian until I get to at least a basic beginner level or just drop it. I'm thinking that if I develop good study habits with Russian, those habits will be transferrable to other languages, but I'm not sure if it's a waste of time to try to develop better habits on a language that isn't my primary interest right now. 

If I could magically push a button to know a language without any effort I would probably choose to know Japanese, but this is the real world and I'm intimidated by the amount of work involved.",1619972006,tesseracts,35

I've read the FAQ and up to Chapter 8 of [this
document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAJForbes/HowtoTeachYourselfaForeignLanguage/master/How%20to%20Teach%20Yourself%20a%20Foreign%20Language.pdf).
I have an idea of how I'm going to start learning the languages I want
to learn but I wanted to write this post so I could maybe get some
additional feedback.

I'm a native English speaker who also speaks Arabic. I can easily hold
conversations in (my dialect of) Arabic, and because most my family are
native Arabic speakers, I know a wide variety of phrases/idioms/what
not. That said my writing/reading is weak.
Also, I have a somewhat limited vocabulary. So my aims
learning Arabic are to first and foremost increase my vocabulary (Anki,
watching/listening to media in Arabic), and reading/writing (I'm less
sure how to do this but it's not a priority for now).

The other language is Mandarin. I don't know any Mandarin.

Because of my situation with Arabic (i.e., I already know a fair bit), I
think it's reasonable for me to try to improve my Arabic and learn
Mandarin at the same time. University is winding down for me now, and I
have a long summer ahead. I want to aim for 2 hours a day studying these
languages, probably equally split between them. I could try to commit to
more, but I don't want to aim too high and get demotivated if that
doesn't work out.

That's all. I'd really appreciate anybody's thoughts! Should I concentrate only improving my Arabic for now? How should I split the 2 hours (is 50/50 a good idea considering my different levels)?",1619967072,sseneca,3

languagelearning,Could only passive learning work out?,"Hello! I'd be happy to hear your advice about a studying issue. I've been studying English for 2 years or so, though some things I got in school and even in childhood earlier. So English sounds pretty familiar to me now. But most of the words I encounter seem to be known before, I don't see many words I acquired recently. 

I supposed that maybe there's a problem with my learning approach. I don't like to read or watch videos, because it requires quite a lot of concentration. My favorite type of studying is listening to stuff like podcast/talk radio, while playing some game that doesn't require to think (e.g. candy crush). So, 90% of my learning is listening and other 10% is my struggle with reading. 

So my question is, where am I going to find myself studying-wise, if I only listen to things passively (without notes, looking up words etc.)?

I typed Spanish test on google and click on the lengalia test. I saw 20 questions and thought why not. After i clicked submit it said congratulations, you are now A2 continue. At first, I did not see the continue and got scared. Once I saw the continue button I realized that I probably hadn't read the instructions well. I hadn't planned to take a test with more than 20 questions so I was a bit frustrated, but I couldn't stop now, so I took the next 20 questions. The audio got faster and the question were a little trickier for me, when I clicked check, it said congratulations you are B2 continue. I knew the next set of questions would be impossible and they were. I no longer had confidence because well I am barely B2, also the passages got longer, the audio was faster, and the unknown verbs made it harder to understand. I thought about just shutting down the test and not try to push it, but then I thought ""why not"". I guessed on more than a few questions which were multiple choice, but I did attempt to understand each question, and when it was time to submit, I stared at the check button like it had the answers for a good couple of minutes. I had two thoughts ""I will fail the last test and stay at B2"" and with a little hope ""well who knows maybe not "". As you can see I clicked on the button finally and saw my results. This does not mean that I became c1 in a month, but it was nice to see, and a motivation to keep working hard to reach c1

languagelearning,Is there any point in using language learning communication apps such as Tandem if English isn't your first language?,"Hey everyone!

So, for the past couple of weeks I've been trying to use Tandem to improve my French accent. I'm a native speaker of Portuguese, and though I have a very good grasp of the language I wouldn't feel confortable teaching/tutoring someone on it.  

After a couple of days I quickly realized that this was a huge impediment in using the app. The vast majority of people are looking to learn English, and most of the few people who were learning Portuguese were ""serial-learners"" (learning 5+ languages at the same time) and had very little knowledge of the language, so I couldn't really help them.  

This left me wondering if there's even a point in engaging people in these types of apps (I know there's a few similar to Tandem) if your native language isn't English. I could start offering help in English but I have a feeling that most learners wouldn't be interested as presumably there's tons of native speakers willing to help.  

Has anyone had any positive experiences in one of these apps without being a native English speaker? I don't want to give up as I feel they can be a powerful tool in making the jump between a student of a language and an actual speaker, but so far my experiences have been disencouraging.",1619934103,meogeul347,6

Listen to podcasts in Spanish designed for language learning

Always listen to Spanish music

Find partners online to have a language exchange with

But some of the cramming has stuck, and so it's a strange learning process. I'm not starting from scrap, but there's also no point where I can just pick it up either. I have to start from the absolute basics yet there are fleeting moments in which I do understand more than I should. And the progress is even weirder: more and more often I listen to video fragments, and I feel like I am JUST ABOUT to understand the whole conversation... And at the same time I don't understand jack sh\*t. But for whatever reason I know I'm close, and just, something has to click and I'll suddenly get it. It's weird. 

I feel like it might be something with the verbs and transition words. I know the nouns, but no amount of nouns in the world make sense without words to connect them. Every sentence needs verbs, and most longer sentences need transition verbs. I'm guessing studying these for a couple weeks/months should cause considerable progress, but unfortunately these words I also find the hardest.

This isn't a particularly useful post I guess but I was wondering if anyone has experienced the same, and what you did to bridge the gap. Have a nice day!",1619817672,BahnwaerterThiel,5

I will attempt to learn a new language every month. And no, I don't wanna speak it perfectly, but my goal is to be able to speak to locals in a foreign country about my day or stuff like that. Ordering something, asking for directions and so on.  
To motivate myself being active I also started a youtube channel, which will hopefully gather a little community around me. Also they could be helpful on questions I have and things like that.

languagelearning,I finished 小王子 this week!,"I've been studying chinese for almost two years now, and for the last several months I'd been reading webnovels in Pleco app where I can click the word for the definition. I also have  been trying to read through my print copy of 镇魂 by priest since that story is what got me into starting to learn way at the start - reading it is doable when I've read the english translation at some point beforehand. So I read some of the translation, then some of the novel. But its very slow going.

Well I got the idea to try to bring my 'base reading' skill up. Because I'd like to eventually read without the click dictionary, without a translation beforehand, and to be able to to read a little faster. Eventually hopefully ;-; So I dug out my old graded readers with 500-1000 characters and read a few of them in a week, then tried to pick a novel that wasn't a graded reader I could try to read. I picked 小王子 because I have a trilingual english/french/chinese copy at home, and one day I plan to read it in french too. I learned french years ago to read other things then just never ended up reading le petit prince.  

So this week I started it, and finished it, in chinese! A few times I had to look up a word, and for two parts I glanced at the english afterwards to make sure I knew what was going on since the plot isn't really predictable (like in the beginning to double check he's really stranded in the Sahara, or when the flower starts talking and it turns from 它 to 她). I'm just really excited I was able to read it! I was even reading a lot of it out loud toward the end! this is huge to me, its the first non-graded reader I finished reading in the language.

My plan had been to pick 'easier' books and push up my reading level, by extensive reading (mostly - I could do intensive at first if it had enough new words, but I mostly do intensive reading of the harder stuff I read in Pleco). And picking slightly harder books each time, until I get my base reading level a bit higher - like 小王子 is the hardest thing I've been able to read without aids for the most part (like dictionary lookup or translation beforehand). I can read 镇魂 without a dictionary but I've read the translation in the past. 

I'm sort of wondering what to try to read next! Though I'm mostly looking at shorter novels still so they take weeks instead of months. I'm already reading 笑猫日记: 会唱歌的猫 but almost done with that one, I think I could pick something with a bit more unknown words to learn. I was thinking maybe 许三观卖血记 by 余华, or 流星·蝴蝶·剑 by Gu Long (because wuxia).

languagelearning,Rational/Irrational fears of speaking in another language,"I think from an outside perspective most of my fears are irrational, but to me they’re very real. 

I’ll start off with rational. If I’m being realistic, my Spanish vocabulary range is B2/C1 somewhere in that range so I can understand texts and write back with almost no problem at all on an intermediate level topic (and in many cases even high level), but my spoken range is quite lower due to a lack of experience. It should be noted I can speak fine but I can’t understand a dang thing said to me half the time. It’s for this reason I am extremely shy about speaking to people.

Here’s a few I think are irrational. The first off is a past accusation of culture stealing/racism. At first it just pissed me off, but the more I thought about it I began to obsess over it and thought to myself “am I really appropriating a culture just by speaking another language?” It keeps me barred from speaking to others because I feel like if I deviate from what is considered the norm for my race, I’m imposing myself on another’s culture. The second is just speaking Spanish when it is unnecessary. I only like to do it when there really isn’t another option to communicate with another or it’s a sensitive topic I don’t want anybody else to know about at the moment. The final one is just flat out embarrassment. I feel like if I mess up on one single thing, a person’s entire view of my progress will have shattered because it would seem I’m not all I was built up to be.

Does anybody else have any fears or problems like these?",1619811397,Matteus6480,7

languagelearning,I cant stop seeing subtitles when i speak,"My target language is English and whenever i speak, i see words in my minds eye. I see sentences i say, word I pronounce, and it feels weird, even though im relatively fluent i really feel like its stuck to me, and apparently its not normal since i dont see words in my native language. Heck.  
Has somebody struggled with anything similar? If so, have you found any trick to employ to deal with it?   
And as a side quest, there's another thing i struggle with, is how to incorporate a new word without assigning it a meaning, but discovering it through the context. Most of the time i feel like i take up a word and stuff it up with some meaning ive looked up, with a little help from examples, and i the word feels like its something completely alien to me, like i dont feel the word, like its a numb lump on my body and despite getting its meaning i have no use for it and whenever I use it i can almost feel its weight on my tongue.  
My personal solution for this problem is as follows:  
Im trying to wear in a new word, take it and try to set aside what original meaning of it i read about and try to picture situations, people, and things to which i could apply this word, even though it could be a long stretch, and im risking misusing this word. Im trying to assign my own meaning to it, set of meanings.  Otherwise if Im not trying to learn a word in this way, it stays outside of my active vocab.

I created a Japanese and Hawaiian amino group who those interested in learning language/culture/etc. This language group is through an app called amino. There are multiple chatrooms, but two of them no English is allowed. Only Japanese or Hawaiian depending on what language you are studying. This is to help get you immersed in the language by practicing typing back in your target language or even reading in your target language. 

There are Studyhall chatrooms where you can look for a study buddy, ask questions, etc. There is one person who is at an advance level of Japanese in the Japanese Studyhall chatroom and another person who is advanced in Hawaiian in the Hawaiian Studyhall chatroom. Currently the group has reached almost 500 members so once it reaches 500 the staff and I will start planning for a special event in the group. 

There is also a Shiritori chatroom (a word game done in Japanese) and an Anime, Manga, and Video Game chatroom to discuss on one of these three topics. There are currently some Japanese language learning video games being developed so I will be an announcement in that chatroom relating to new development of the game or if the video games that teach Japanese that have been released.) 

Been sure when you enter into the group to check out all the current and past featured posts as you will sse Japanese and Hawaiian culture posts, language lessons, learning resources, and so on.

languagelearning,I feel like a complete idiot,"For the last two years, I have fantasised about becoming bilingual. Whether that be through watching countless hours of YouTube related language acquisition content, chatting to other language learners in Discord communities, watching Netflix shows with English subtitles from various different countries or dabbling in random languages for five minutes to test out random apps just for the sake of it.

It might sound like I don’t want to learn a language but for some reason I can’t shake the feeling that it’s something deeply rooted that I want to do. However, the idea of starting is the only point I reach and I never commit. A lot of the time it’s out of fear I’ll choose the ‘wrong’ one or I become fascinated by another language after seeing another type of content in another language etc. 

Right now I feel overwhelmed by paradox of choice and decision fatigue but I’m determined language learning is for me. I think so many languages are beautiful and if I could swallow a pill to be fluent in all of them then I would, as I’m sure a lot of people would. 

I guess I’m feeling like a fraud because why am I spending all this time investing interest into languages but not actually learning one and I wonder if anyone has any idea how I can get myself out of this rut?

languagelearning,Speaking anxiety with foreign languages,"Context: Been learning Spanish in school for about 2 years (Around A2 level at this point) and I still get really bad anxiety whenever we have a speaking assignment, or I try to speak to a native.

From my experience, I’ve heard foreign language speaking anxiety is quite common, as I myself and multiple people I know suffer from it while trying to speak the language they’re learning. The annoying part about my situation though, is that it’s totally unnecessary, as I’ve gotten multiple compliments from my teacher, and even a native at one point for my pronunciation. Yet I still shake and struggle to stay calm whenever I’m asked to speak. 

I’ve heard you want to practice speaking fairly early on so you can get a grip on it, but it’s so much harder to when you get anxiety whenever you’re asked to speak. Something that might factor into this though, is the rate at which Spanish is spoken (2nd fastest spoken language), which definitely does not help my case. Even (to a lesser extent) with communicating over text, I’ll still find myself breaking down halfway through a sentence because I just assume I’m doing something wrong, when in reality, all the mistakes I’ve made are minor. 

The point of all this is, I’d like to know if anyone shares my plight with speaking and/or generally sharing any kind of information in a foreign language, if anyone has overcame it, and how.

I like the format : a white board that doesn't change throughout the lesson you can make into a very visual revision card, the fact she guides you to repeat what you learn outloud and the short length of the videos (10min).

Any ideas ?",1619765775,EastPrimary8,6
languagelearning,Archaic English: VERBS!!!!!!,"I've been doing some research on the archaic English lately and so far what I understand is that:

1- Singular second-person (Thou) regular verbs get ""-st"" or ""-est"" at the end and there are irregular verbs e.g Dost, Hast, Wast, Wilt, Shalt...

2 - Singular third-person (He) regular verbs get ""-th"" and ""-eth"" at the end and the modals remain the same with exception of ""do"" and ""have"" that change to ""doth"" and ""hath""

3 - I also read that these do not apply to past form and past participle form of the verbs, and that they apply to simple present.

(Correct me if I'm wrong in any part)

Now here are my questions:

What about ""can"" and ""can not"", will they change for second-person singular or no? If yes, how is it written?

For negative form of singular third and second-person verbs, is adding not after them the only way to write them or there are other ways too? If there is/are, What is it/are they?

About second and third-person singular of present progressive, present perfect and present perfect continuous, do statement 1 and 2 apply to them? If yes, will they be written as:

""You are playing = Thou art playing, You were eating = Thou wert eating""

""She has eaten = She hath eaten, You have done = thou hast done""

""He has been consuming = He hath been consuming, You have been reading = Thou hast been doing""",1619759667,NightRider8203,11

languagelearning,Difference in speech between the sexes?,"Not sure if this is the right place to post, but I’ve learned of a couple different things lately where men and women speak differently.

It isn’t a difference in word choice or grammar, but the phonology of the language. The two instances of this are found in Japanese and English (the ones I know of that is).

In English, females are more likely to speak with a vocal fry, or creaky voice. It doesn’t change meaning of words, it doesn’t impair grammar or anything like that. This is also limited to example from my American Culture.

In Japanese, so I’m told, the way men and women handle whispered vowels is different. Women whisper them, while men are more likely to omit them entirely. I’m told that if a man learns Japanese from a native woman, he’s likely to be made fun of by native speaking men for talking like a woman does.

I did French at school but wasnt very good. But during lockdown I developed an interest in studying it and have been taking Beginners Plus classes for French, currently I am doing part 2 after having started in January. 

I am enjoying the classes but I find French harder than Japanese. I like how japanese is phonetic so I feel more confident speaking in it, french I find harder.

I'm just studying as a hobby but what put me off Japanese was the usefulness of it or lack of. To be honest French probably isnt 'useful' either but as I'm in the UK it is much closer to visit. Ideally I'd like to focus on one language really though.

I feel like I'm at a bit of a crossroads. Of course I need to finish my French course but part of me is thinking in hindsight that I should have stuck with Japanese as I had a more solid foundation for it.

I'm very into languages but I've never been able to decide weather or not to learn French or Spanish.

I'm not sure what my plans are for the future but I'm not sure if I'll be living outside of Canada. I'll probably travel a little bit, but I'll more than likely remain in Canada. My dad works on the lake boats (CSL) and his best friend is from Quebec. He picked up a bit of french from his friend but he mostly speaks English to my dad.

Now I'm not sure how accurate this is but I'm just curious. There's always been something about Spanish that interests me. I love the music, and also I've been to Spain so I got to learn about Spanish culture and I loved it. I was supposed to go to Paris this Easter break but covid got in the way, so maybe I would've enjoyed Paris more.

languagelearning,How can I improve my learning approach? (Brazilian Portuguese),"I am a native English speaker who is learning Brazilian Portuguese. I learned some French in school which helps a lot with vocab (for example the numbers are practically identical apart from pronunciation). I also learned some Dutch. 

My current methods are:

* Pimsleur: completed level 1 and starting on level 2
* Assimil: started a while after starting Pimsleur, I'm on lesson 24 at the moment
* Anki: I add as many new phrases as possible to an excel sheet as input for my own Anki deck and review them to make sure I know the new vocab and grammar. The process of writing them in is probably the most useful part
* Speaking to my Brazilian gf and she corrects the Assimil or my pronunciation
* Duolingo: just a lesson every day to get some vocab and keep my streak

I'd guess I'm around A1 level. I try to do 30 mins-1 hour a day. 

I guess my main concern is doing pimsleur and assimil in parallel might not be very efficient. Am I wasting time on too much beginner stuff? My main problem with French/Dutch was always with speaking, so Pimsleur is helping a lot there...

Hi, I want to share a link to something awesome. A study time calculator. 

It is based on the FSI estimates and takes into account several variables. As the author says, you need to take it with a grain of salt because it cannot take into account everything (but I don't agree that just not being an English native makes it not applicable to you at all).

So, if you feel any kind of ""how long to reach B1"" or ""for how long a day should I study"" question burning you, go for it. I find it surprisintly realistic, in spite of the obvious limitations. 

What I like the most is clearly visualising the link between the results and several common variables. Your motivation (it even surprised me, how much this one changed the estimate), amount of study sessions per week, length of the study sessions (finally! someone recognizes that the ""ten minutes a day"" approach is horrible for most people, because you'll need decades to get somewhere), and previous experience (in a limited way, ""just"" whether you've learnt a language yet, not which one).

I played with it a bit yesterday and I was surprised. I found the estimates realistic and motivating. And given the nature of the impreciseness, I think most people are likely to do slightly better than expected, if we really stick to the plan put in.

languagelearning,Can speakers of Romance languages understand Romansh?,"[Romansh vs Romanian vs Italian vs French | Can they understand each other? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy5Sa05UHxA) 

Romansh is a Romance language spoken in the Swiss canton of Grisons. Together with German French, and Italian, it forms the official languages of Switzerland. However, it is spoken by about 44,354 people in Switzerland or 0.85% of the population of Switzerland, making it a minority language. It is sometimes grouped by linguists with Ladin and Friulian as the Rhaeto-Romance languages, though this is disputed. 

What do you think of the Romansh language? Personally, as a Spanish speaker, I always found French and Romanian among the hardest of the Romance languages to understand, but this one makes those two languages sound like a piece of cake. People like to say French is the most Germanized Romance language, but Romansh makes me think otherwise.",1619684233,Lissandra_Freljord,3

Hello everyone, I hope you are well and I know that maybe this is wrong for me to make this post, but I will try to say a little and I apologize to those who may be offended by my publication.
Since some years my situation in Venezuela has been quite frustrating, working a month to only buy food for a couple of days is desperate and I do not know what to do, I feel I am at the limit with the madness of this country, at the beginning of 2020 I finally got my passport. 
The last week I have been talking to my mother and I think the best option is to go to any nearby country where I can have a job and be able to send money to my family, I have a 2 year old daughter that I do not want to continue growing under the distance and corruption of this country. 
I would like to be able to take my daughter out of this country someday and give her a better education in another place and that she does not learn from what is lived in this country where it is normal daily deaths due to malnutrition or malpractice in a hospital....
I want to ask for help to those who have the possibility to do so, to help me with anything that will help me to even pay a but ticket to the fronters of Brazil or Colombia and finally get out of here.

I came to Reddit because I know it's a great community and I thought I could find some help. Anyone who can lend me anything, I promise to return the favor as soon as I find a job. In my house in Venezuela there are days where there is nothing to eat and it's hard to sleep without food and not knowing what you're going to eat the next day. 
So I would just like to change my mother's days a little bit and give my daughter a better growth.

Anyone who can help with anything or at least help with advice, I would appreciate it. Thank you all for reading and forgive me for this, I am quite embarrassed, but my desperation is greater than the embarrassment",1619680246,Sea-Initiative-6277,2

languagelearning,What Languages have a doubling operator like Thai’s ๆ ?,"So, although I do not know the technical jargon for it, there is this symbol in Thai: ๆ. When written, it’s a substitute for repeating the previous word (e.g. for emphasis). So “ เด็กๆ “ would be read as “ เด็ก เด็ก “. (The word means “child”, emphasized it becomes “children” but read more like “child child”.)

I was wondering what other languages have such a construct? The Thai wikipedia page on this topic mentions that Laos (understandably, considering history), and I think Cambodia, have a variant of this. I know that in English people repeat (parts of) sentences via putting double quotes (“) on the line below it —although that’s kind of a different thing.",1619679068,Nilstyle,7

Obviously I'd be looking for the courses in English above the original French or other languages, but it would be nice to also see all the editions published in other languages, since I know a fair bit of French and German and could maybe hack translating the courses into English once I had them in front of me (and it would be a decent method to burn the content into my brain tbh).

languagelearning,French vs Italian... And why do people say learning Italian is useless?,"Hello,

I live in the Northeast of the United States which has several communities with Italian roots (I can only think of Little Italy in New York). I am torn between learning French or Italian. At first I was leaning towards French due to its popularity amongst language learners and the sheer number of countries that speak it. I've always loved how elegant and sophisticated it sounds, and even better that it's on the easier side to learn for English speakers. 

However, I think Italian is the more 'beautiful' language and the pronunciation is easier which is encouraging for new learners. I also love Italian cuisine and their culture, more specifically, the emphasis on delicious food and closeness of family and traditional living. (At least it's like this for the most part in Southern Italy as opposed to Northern, I hear, but correct me if I'm wrong!)

I've been doing lots of research on which language to invest my time into. I do want to be fluent in both languages eventually, but it's more reasonable to focus on one first. I was going through some Reddit posts for others' opinions and saw that many think Italian is USELESS to learn for an American, because apparently in Italy there's so many dialects and smaller languages that being fluent in Italian won't be as helpful as being fluent in French - and even then, your best bet for actually using French would be if you were in France. Italian is already really only spoken in Italy so hearing about this was discouraging. 

Ultimately, my goals would be to effectively be bilingual. As a bonus, I'd love to work in either country or for a company that needs the language, but another discouraging thing is that the economy in Southern Italy (where I'd prefer to live) is not too great in terms of job opportunities and I'd have to move to Milan or somewhere up North. While France is generally a better place for work and studies. I want to be able to converse, read, and understand with the same fluency as English. But hearing such sad news on the state of Italy and its language puts me down, and makes me want to lean towards French. 

Anyways I apologize for such a long post - I've really been struggling with this decision for a while and I know the answer should be as simple as ""follow your passion"" but I love both equally, just for different reasons I guess. I'd appreciate if some Italian and French natives could weigh in on the information I discussed and maybe give some uplifting/motivational reasons to learn!",1619562035,elegante_nero,46

languagelearning,Fluency matters.,"Welcome to my little storytime.

I was at school today and we had a new student come in, he was from Russia, but he claimed that he could speak Russian and Ukrainian. 

(We're in the United States) His English was very very elementary level and I felt really bad because I wanted to help but I couldn't, matter of fact, I don't know a single Russian letter. It was evident that he really understood near to none of what was being said. He was struggling to understand what everyone- including the teacher was saying.

We're in a very diverse area, we literally have people from Haiti, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Germany, Honduras, Syria, Iraq, China, Brazil, and I've had a few friends from a small island that speaks Italian as a primary language (forgot what it was called). Therefore, we have Arabic, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese, and Mandarin speakers.

The administration offered him a student translator but unfortunately we don't have a single Student/staff member that's fluent at Russian in the entire school.

It really got me thinking about how if each person in the world spoke a pair of two different languages, everything would be more outgoing and easy. (Ej: English and Spanish or French and Russian or English and Arabic, etc) 

But obviously, it's way harder than it sounds because there are a lot of obstacles and not everyone in the world has the resources and technology necessary to learn a foreign language.

I wanted to let everyone here know I will be broadcasting a live stream on my YouTube channel ""youtube.com/shujincell"" on May 8th. No exact time set so please follow the channel for updates. 

   
In recent time there's a lot of of misinformation and lies surrounding Laoshu505000 online. Mainly because many of the people who know him aren't known the the public. The most disappointing part about this the main source of this false information has been spread by his brother, who fell out with 505000 10 months before his death. He's now using this tragic situation in order to scam people out of money. Although the attempt at scam as hilarious as it is, it's pitiful, confusing a lot of individuals, and most importantly tarnishing his name when he is gone.    
I'm here to spread the truth and answer questions from everyone LIVE in order to give those who have been affected by his passing clarity and peace of mind.

Hey guys! I'm going to take an exam in Italian this spring, which I am now preparing for. The exam is not super advanced, more like a medium level. I will be tested partially in my ability to speak Italian, and partially in my knowledge of Italian culture, history, etc.

This is the way the exam works:

* They first give me a subject, which is usually something relevant or recent. Like: if I were to read the newspapers every day for the last year (or 3 years), what would be the most important things? (that is not related to corona)
* They then ask me to talk about this subject for approximately 10 minutes. They might ask me some questions to make me showcase my knowledge.
* After this phase, I am given the task to talk for 20 minutes, and here I can talk more broadly, and showcase my general knowledge of Italian culture and history. I dont need to know things very in depth, but being able to know the broad strokes and show a fundamental understanding of the country is important. Which historical events are particulary important in shaping the Italy that we have today? Which cultural aspects of Italy are considered very central and important?

I already know some of these things myself, and I am naturally planning to do more research alone, but I figured I could ask some of you Italy-experts for advice. What could be smart to learn and prepare for? In your opinion, what are the things that could be important for me to learn?

I would greatly appreciate any tips!

languagelearning,"Loving a language, but not too interested in the courses my college offers","I’ve been studying Spanish since the seventh grade and I’m currently a sophomore in college. Although my spoken Spanish is not the greatest (it’ll undoubtedly improve once I am able to study abroad in Spain), I would say I have a very strong grasp of the language. I conducted my first meeting with my Spanish major advisor all in Spanish and my advisor seem very impressed (I’m sure he encourages all his students and says similar things, though).

I have not decided what I want to do for work after college, but I’m seriously considering teaching English in Spain for a year or two and then coming back to the U.S and teaching high school Spanish. I truly love the language, have a passion for learning languages, and would love to be able to hopefully pass my passion onto students.

Obviously while learning any language you are forced to learn the culture of whatever people speak it, and while I enjoy passively learning about the history, literature, etc. of Spain, I really don’t have any interest in some of the classes I have to take to complete my major. I get that it is what it is and I hate to complain, but I could not care less about classes about short stories in early 20th century Spain, or contemporary female writers of Spain, and I don’t feel  like they’re entirely useful for what I want to do as a job. Again I know it’s important to know the culture of the language you’re learning and speaking and that’s it’s just a part of the process, but reading all of these random short stories is not going to better prepare me to teach high schoolers the foundations of Spanish and more conversational Spanish.

Sometimes having to take these classes discourages me from my passion for it, but it always comes back. I guess it could maybe come down to the fact that I’m not as interested in the academic side of learning a language (meaning that I enjoy learning languages to be able to meet people in different countries and make new friends, rather than learning the language with the goal of reading famous Spanish literature). 

I hope I communicated my thoughts fairly well. I’d appreciate any comments / advice / opinions on this topic. And please don’t be mean to me if this sounds ignorant that I don’t care about things that are seemingly important. Thank you! :)",1619494421,TheFoolsWhoDream,5

languagelearning,My teacher hates my non-British pronunciation,"Hello everyone, recently I started a course of studies to become an English teacher, my native language is Spanish, but I started learning English when I was 8 years old and I consider myself to be quite fluent. Due to exposure to content from the US 90% of the time, and the only people I've talked to in English being relatives from California, I speak with an American English pronunciation. So, thing is, we have phonology and laboratory practice, and we're expected to speak with a British pronunciation ONLY. My teacher insists that otherwise no one will understand my pronunciation, regardless of it being good. Is this true? Do I reaaaally need to talk RP-ish to be understood in Europe?

languagelearning,Reflections on a year of Spanish,"Sorry if it's too long and obligatory sorry for all eventual English mistakes.

Summary:

I can hold easy conversations, watch Netflix without subtitles and (with some effort but without a dictionary) read contemporary literature after a year of studying Spanish.

Here is what I did right:

Start with one or two beginner resources and follow them

Start reading graded readers and continue reading

Study every day

Focus on pronunciation early and continuously

Track your progress and break down goals

Wait with getting a tutor until you’re at a more intermediate level


Here is what i would change:

You will be able to consume native level novels/podcasts, don’t stress about it

You do build listening skills even if you use TL subtitles, begin watching series when you understand the subtitles

You don’t need Anki in the beginning, but you will need it eventually



Background: Motivation, Previous Languages and Experience.

I’m a 26 year old accountant from Sweden. I decided to try to learn Spanish about a year ago because my girlfriend's family is from Chile (but she’s born here and her parents have lived here for 30+ years). I do not however speak spanish with my girlfriend and her Swedish is better than her Spanish. 

I’m a native swedish speaker and my passive English is very good, i haven’t “studied” since i left high school after 10 year of classroom studies but i watch Youtube/Netflix/HBO etc all the time without subtitles (they bug me) and read both fiction and non-fiction books and have read Coursebooks and Academic articles in English at University and it’s very rareI don’t understand anything. I’m unsure about my writing skills (if you make it through this wall of text you can probably judge that better than me) but I don’t like to speak English. have an obvious foreign/Swedish accent, considerably worse than other Swedes in my age group who often giggle at my pronunciation or think I’m joking. I’m naturally quite shy and since I’m so self aware I don’t want to speak English if I can avoid it. This is the main reason why I’ve focused so much on pronunciation when learning Spanish.

I’ve studied french for 6 years in middle and high school. I had good but not great grades but i could barely watch a movie with subtitles and couldn’t really hold an conversation, I’m pretty sure I wouldn't have been able to read a novel. After school I have made some efforts to try to better my french, most seriously about 4 years ago with Duolingo, Le petit Prince, half an Harry Potter book, easy french news and flashcards learnt in isolation (not even from a frequency list but just from a pocket dictionary, I learnt all the entries under A and maybe  ⅓ under B). Needless to say, I wasn’t any closer to french fluency after these months of self study.

So last spring when I decided to study Spanish on my own I had already tested many of the methods first time language learners try and fail with. 

Beginner resources: Assimil, Madrigal’s Magic Key and Graded Readers

Since I was out of a job last summer I decided to dedicate the summer to Spanish. I think the most important decision I took was to spend a week in the beginning to research language learning methods and resources. Every morning I would do a chapter of Assimil and one chapter of Madrigal Magic Key. Assimil for those who might not know is basically listen and repeat exercises with transcriptions in the target language and (in this case) English, with some grammar notes with increasing difficulty. Madrigal's Magic Key is a very nice book which teaches you cognates and grammar patterns with the goal to make you speak. After some weeks I got the third resource, Olly Richards Graded Readers for beginners.

I really liked all three of these resources. I credit Assimil and shadowing the lessons for having a very solid base in pronunciation early as well as covering a lot of areas I might not have learnt otherwise. 

The main advantage of Madrigal is to make spanish feel easy and boost your confidence. The feeling that after 30 minutes I could say literally hundreds of sentences was really nice, even though all the sentences had to follow this pattern “El presidente es Excelente” and “la pianista es competente”. If you already speak English and want to start speaking fast this is great. But if you’re not in a hurry, you can probably skip it, you will figure it out anyway. 

The very nice thing about the graded readers was that I really struggled in the beginning and read the first chapters (of 3-4 pages) several times very slowly but towards the end of the book I read through the chapters very easily and understood them the first time. I ordered the books for intermediate readers in the same series midway through the first book.

Input, tracking and goals

The key to my success is that I decided to study every day. I have a “goal tracker” app on my phone where I simply make a check each day I have studied or exposed myself to Spanish in some way. Right now I have a 70 day streak and I have studied Spanish for at least 30 min for 339 of the last 357 days.

In the fall I began to track how many pages I’d read and how many hours I’d listened to. I first set the goal to 10,000 pages and 1,000 hours of input. So every 100 pages and every 10 hours of listening was 1% towards the goal. After reading u/xanthic_strath's post [Spanish Listening from B1 to a solid C1 in 500 hours over 7 months](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/j1gbrg/spanish_listening_from_b1_to_a_solid_c1_in_500/) I decided to change my listening goal to 500 hours instead of 1000. Later I changed my reading goal to 5,000 pages because I noticed that otherwise I focused too little on listening when trying to work towards my goals. 


Listening:

I had tried to watch La Casa de las Flores even before i started with the other stuff, i watched each episode first with swedish subtitles and then again without subtitles. I felt this was very ineffective and stopped watching Netflix for a long time. Instead I listened to a lot of podcasts for learners and several audiobooks (Harry Potter, 1,2,5 and 6, Sapiens and other non-fiction books). 

Every time I tried to watch a tv-series it seemed too hard so I quickly gave up because it was much easier working toward my goals with Audiobooks and Podcasts. But recently I decided that it was OK to watch series with subtitles (and that it was ok to count this as listening on my spreadsheet). After watching the first season of “El ministerio del tiempo” and the first season of “La Casa de Papel” I realised that I could watch them without subtitles. I had read so much online about the drawbacks of subtitles that I had been missing out on this for too long.

Today I have listened to 277 hours of which 133 is Audible, 60 is podcasts or other Audiobooks and 84 is from TV, but I wish I had watched a lot more TV a lot sooner.

Reading:

I have read a total of 3585 pages and finished about 15 books. The latest books I finished was “La veulta al mundo en 80 días” and “Aura”, and I’m currently reading La sombra del viento” and “La Casa de Espiritus. Of course I read more slowly than in English or Swedish but it’s fun and i understand basically everything without a dictionary.

Speaking:
I didn’t say much during the first months of studying. I said some phrases when being very kindly encouraged by my girlfriend’s family to explain something we had talked about but my father in law hadn’t listened to understand. It was fun getting compliments by what I was able to say but I didn’t have any conversations, I just formulated a sentence in my head and said it out loud, if that makes sense.

Since the end of December i have had 8-10 lessons with a Chilean tutor on Italki. In the beginning it was super hard and very draining, but now I feel much more confident and comfortable to say that I can, in fact, speak Spanish. 

Writing:

I have only written in preparation for the Italkt lessons and had Streak på r/writestreakes of around 5 days. But writing is an area where I have very little interest because while I do very much want to travel to Spain and Latinamerica and speak with natives and read classic and contemporary Latinamerican literature I don’t really see any use or pleasure to derive from writing.

Grammar:

I like languages and think grammar is fun, but besides the start with Madrigal’s magic key, I have found that input really is a lot better than grammar study. But I do read about concepts and I have made an effort to learn the difference between the past tenses, Ser/Estar and Por/Para. I’m now studying the subjunctive and I finally feel like I get it! 

Pronunciation

From the very beginning, I was determined to not end up like I did i English: good passive knowledge but too shy to talk because of my bad pronunciation. So I started listening and repeating and shadowing from the start and have continued all the time with some shadowing or reading out loud.

Around 2 months ago I got a tutor on italki that specializes in phonetics, prosody and pronunciation. He made me do a test where I read certain words out loud and made notes about the areas where I need to improve. I have had homework where I focus on minimal pairs or hard words, and it has been great! If you care about pronunciation and can afford it, I can really recommend this. Beside improving my pronunciation, being very aware of the sounds of the language has improved my listening skills as well.

Vocabulary

I did use premade Anki cards in the beginning but got tired of it and decided that if I just read enough I would eventually learn enough words anyway. However some weeks ago i found a list of words from a book i read in december and realised I didn’t recognise 9/10 of them, so I decided to begin using Anki cards again to remember words I pick up when reading. 

Going forward

My goals going forward is to continue working on my pronunciation with my tutor and getting the subjunctive down. But the main goal is still to complete 5,000 pages and 500 hours of listening. I have an Idea that it would be nice to finish before my vacation that starts in mid july. That means I have to listen to 165 minutes and read 17 pages per day, which seems very ambitious but certainly doable. That wouldn’t mean I was finished with Spanish of course but maybe I could treat myself to studying another language for some month before going back to Spanish. ",1619445851,Inevitable_Hunter_61,18

languagelearning,My Favourite Learning Method W/ Reference Pictures,"I shared this in the Hungarian sub and people seemed to find it useful, it works for any language and I now use it for French! I found the method on tiktok from @ K8sabz. I used this as a beginner last year:

Make a language journal. Format it with 5 new vocab words, explain two grammar concepts, a few lines of writing in x tense, conjugate 3 verbs in x tense, every 10 days switch the tense. Once you're done, record yourself speaking whatever you wrote. To this day I go back to my language journal. Your writing won't be good at first but that's okay! I used to dedicate 25-35 minutes a day to this and it was such a massive help. I've included pictures of my journal below for reference, they are messy and have some mistakes but that's how we learn when we start! 

I haven't used it since I was a beginner but once I get to the same level in French I will continue making journal entries for both my languages at higher levels.

languagelearning,"Why is it that in discussions of world languages on the internet (especially on American websites) the languages of sub-saharan African peoples are almost completely ignored and are rarely, if ever, mentioned?","This is something I have been noticing, to my amazement, for quite some time now while browsing all kinds of (mostly American owned) sites where languages are discussed. I only got inspired to finally asking about it when I came across a reddit discussion where one guy ignorantly asserted that “Asian languages (and Arabic) are objectively the most difficult languages for western people to learn”, obviously completely forgetting the existence of African languages. 

While even the languages of third world and relatively obscure peoples in other parts of the world (like in Polynesia, Asia and so on) are often mentioned in the discussions, native sub-saharan African peoples languages are pretty much never mentioned at all. It’s as though Americans are completely unaware of their existence. And this is despite the fact that America’s historically largest minority racial group is of African descent! Which makes it even more astonishing. 

Even major African languages with tens of millions of speakers across Africa and other parts of the world, like Yoruba (which is also spoken in the Caribbean and Brazil), Fula (which is spoken all over west Africa), Zulu, Setswana (which is the language of Botswana, the only ethnically homogenous country in Africa and (thus) the most stable and economically prosperous country in Africa) are never mentioned!! But I’ve noticed that they are much more likely to be mentioned in non-American sites by non-American posters.

As an example of this phenomenon, this reddit section for languages has a list at the left side of the page called ""Language-Specific Subreddits"" which lists geographic and cultural regions/clusters of languages, include categories like 'Austronesian', 'Afro-Asiatic' (Aramaic, Egyptian, etc..), 'Sino-Tibetan' etc.. 

But sub-saharan African clusters/regions are completely omitted! 

Sure, in the ‘other’ section, Swahili is mentioned but that is pretty much it. (And Swahili, in any case, has too much Arabic influence to be even considered a true native African language, thus there is still an element of anti-African bias there).

By the way, I should mention that language is not the only issue in which I have noticed this habitual omission of African people by Americans. I’ve noticed for many years that this happens all the time whenever anything to do with human culture is being discussed. Typically, the speaker will rattle of a list of geographical groups (Europeans, Asians, Native Americans, Arabs, etc..) and make no mention of Africans. I think the most astonishing and bizarre example of this is the book ‘The world’s religions’ written by a white American writer. The book ran the gamut on both major and indigenous religions from European to Polynesian religions all over the world, but, amazingly, made no mention whatsoever of native African religions, not even the Orisha religion which is practiced by millions of people in the new world INCLUDING Afro-Americans within the US itself, the very place where the author lives!! Even African-inspired religions like Voodoo were not mentioned at all. It’s as though this white American author somehow forgot that black people even exist.

I tend to suspect that this bizarre tendency to consciously or subconsciously omit Africans from any human-culture discussions by (white) Americans is very much a symptom of a much more general societal tendency within the United States by white America to dehumanize black people. There is no other rational way to explain this tendency especially given the fact that people of African descent are such a significant aspect of American population and history.",1619437006,0bs6rv6r,18
languagelearning,"If you ever plan on doing the Lingoda Sprint, don't be like me... CHECK THE DATES","So I'm writing this partly to warn others and partly because I need people to laugh at me to help me not feel as mad at myself ahaha

Basically, I signed up for the Lingoda sprint, read the rules, received my credits last week and booked all my classes for this week. What I didn't realise was that they had made it so that this week technically starts on Wednesday... today is Monday. I have a class today...

Because I have booked a class outside of the 'promotion time' it means I have one less class than I need to be able to complete the sprint. I have literally failed it before I have even started!!! 

I don't know whether to laugh or cry because damn getting that refund at the end was the type of motivation I needed but now it's gone!!

So yeah, don't be like me and check the actual dates. I just assumed that it started from today because it said on the email I received ""book your classes for next week"" and didn't mention that the actual start date was Wednesday. It even has a part in the 'rules' that says 'it is the participants responsibility to book the classes within the promotion and not before'. Clearly, they do this on purpose so that they can trick stupid people like me out of their refund.

languagelearning,How do you ensure that you are actually and constantly moving forward?,"Hey all!

A little wall of text to provide some background, you can find the question itself in TLDR.

My native language is Turkish and I've learned English through video games, movies, tv series and books - a constant exposure to the language. All my life I've considered myself being bad with langauges (mostly due to bad grades in school) and indifferent on learning one. I don't really know how I've come to being able to communicate through English, but somewhere and somehow along the way its been achived. I never sat down with an intention to study English. I've aced a nation-wide english exam last year but yet I'm never proud of the way I construct sentences nor gramatical knowladge.

I've also learned Spanish in last 2 years, once again through listening to audiobooks, watching netflix with voice-overs and playing some AAA games in Spanish localization. But as my exposure is not as constant and stable as its been with English and as a result I'm not actually improving but almost plateauing. 

I decided to set \~an hour aside each day to further develop my Spanish, but I have no clue on what to do and how to come up with a way to find what/where I lack and enforce it. Furthermore I want to study French, but with a more traditional approach, just to study that way of studying and compare its effectivenes.

So, TLDR; Those who systematically study a langauge and organize a way to proceed. What does your todo's look like and how do you find the things you lack understanding or find things to improve, to achive a constant improvement on a daily basis.

I was exposed to the first at school and university and to the latter in daily life. But, along with these two variations, there exist many others in countries with English as their official or second language, along with different variations even within the same region, area or city. Having so many models can sometimes create confusion. In the case of Chinese, there exists a standard variation, which is Mandarin Chinese or Putonghua. The problem is that Chinese population is extremely numerous, and daily speaks several dialects and local languages, and each place within China only has its own accent. In the case of languages with few speakers, there is the opposite problem. It becomes very difficult to find mother tongue speakers and audio material, even in the Internet age. What do you think?

I'm still on the fence about whether to learn a niche language or a widespread language. On one hand a niche language would help as it would be an asset not many others have but on the other hand a widespread language means I could communicate with more people.

And just to put this out there, this isn't the end all be all. My final decisions will ultimately be based upon how passionate I am about learning said language but knowing how useful each one is will definitely play a role. So yeah, any advice is greatly appreciated.

I've learned a couple languages before (I'm an American so I don't know how to translate into 'levels' like I see a variety of y'all listing...I did like 12 years of primary and high school Spanish, then a year of ASL at university, English is my native language) but never really maintained fluency, especially not spoken fluency.

At home, spouse and I speak almost exclusively English, because when we met I spoke no Greek (her native language) and unsurprisingly she is fully fluent in English. A couple of years ago I took 6 months of university-level greek, and I recently did about a year of duolingo before getting too bored by the repetition and frustrated by the....lack of practicality of the content. I'm looking at starting other online Greek courses now. So at this point I'm probably somewhere between beginner and intermediate in Greek. But speaking in English is still more efficient  and less likely for communication errors/misunderstandings to occur, so we still just speak English together. 

Now obviously I'm not expecting to switch over to Greek for major, important conversations yet and I don't want to make my spouse feel like a language teacher, ready to jump in and correct my grammar/vocab/etc all the time, but she and I both agree that integrating speaking greek at home more is a really powerful tool for me to develop fluency (which is important to her as well).

I am currently picking out my senior year schedule. For the past 3 years I have been taking Spanish because my school has a foreign language requirement.  If I stay with the standard progression I will be in AP Spanish next year.  However, recently the Japanese language has caught my attention due to my interest in their culture along with the potential to work in a Japanese company down the line.  I plan on taking Japanese classes in college and hopefully studying abroad.

My question is: Should I finish out with Spanish, or should I start to teach myself hiragana and some basic conversation skills over the next year to prep me for my college plans?  Don’t get me wrong, I do not hate Spanish, I actually find it quite interesting and I’ve been pretty good at it so far.  However, I just don’t feel as motivated to continue my study with input outside of the classroom, which I know is necessary if I want to actually be able to use Spanish.  I also recognize that as an American I will encounter Spanish speakers far more often.

I really want to learn Spanish since I moved to the Southern portion of the US. I have a lot of social anxiety and am a bit scared to start because of my lisp and heavy Minnesotan accent. When I get particularly nervous, I’ll throw a stutter into the mix too. 

I have a lisp, partially due to malocclusion and an underdeveloped jaw. I’m happy to say that I just started orthodontics and will be getting double jaw surgery in the next year to resolve the physical anomalies. I’ll have to do speech-therapy for a bit after the surgery as well, and am hoping the lisp and r issue will be resolved. 

I never took a Spanish class because I was worried I’d fail because of my speech impediments and inability to roll my /r/.  I would like to begin learning now though, especially during the summer in between semesters when I have a lot of time to devout. 

Since living in the South, I’ve picked up a bit of vocabulary and could be somewhat conversational. I live and work in an area with mostly Spanish speakers, most of my neighbors don’t speak English well, so Ive been immersed real quick. I know enough to understand basic conversation, order food, etc. but I’m terrified to speak with someone because I know it sounds bad, so I only respond in English.

Anyone have tips on speaking despite my lisp? (Everyone says to practice the word perro but because of the appliance in my mouth, I physically cannot move my tongue to the tip of my mouth.)

Will people be rude to me if I try to talk to them with my poor accent? lol.

Now my mum is learning Italian, and I would like to give her a book like it. I found a *Bescherelle Italien* but it's for French learners of Italian, so every explanatory text is in French, which my mum doesn't know (we're Mexican so we speak Spanish natively).

Does anyone know of a good verb conjugation book like the Bescherelle but entirely in Italian? I've found some ""I verbi italiani"" books on Amazon but they seem very low quality, much unlike my old Bescherelle, which was hardcover, very concise and pocketable.",1619379223,akirivan,4

To me Greek is one of the most beautiful languages and it has that melodic sound like Spanish, so if I actually learned it, would I stop hearing the songs in the same way and would it stop feeling melodic and just start feeling like any other song in my language or English?

I just wanted to make a post today to ask for advice and see if any of you have been in a similar situation. I just finished my academic school year and one of the courses I took was an introduction to Spanish. 

I learned a lot of Spanish by taking the course, and now that is done I want to continue to learn on my own. I already was learning outside of the classroom by using Duolingo and watching Spanish television, but I am worried that I am going to forget a lot of what I leaned if I do not keep up with it.

Have any of you guys been in a similar situation? What did you do in order to stay focused and what resources did you do to continue your leaning?

At the moment I am continuing to use Duolingo and trying to watch Spanish television with subtitles to keep it all in my brain. Is there any other suggestions that people have that I should do in order to keep learning?  I am going to take another Spanish course next year, but that won't happen until September.

When I really started thinking about it, I realized I wanted to study and live in Spain after I graduated, and when I have my mind set to something I am extremely determined to do it, so... There I went, and decided that in these 3 years I would become fluent in Spanish, despite having no opportunity to visit Spain and not having anyone around me that speaks the language. I went studying like craaazy, first I started with duolingo, but hell, it takes so long and it only gets you to like level A2 or something so I gave up on that and started really studying important stuff and stuff I wanted to learn. I ordered a grammar book and worked it through in just a few days by putting in about 18 hours a DAY of work (I told ya i am determined). I started writing for hours and hours to write down everything I had learned, should know, and spent days writing and writing, after which I started learning and learning and jesus.. I realize now when writing this I am absolutely insane xD I started learning verb tenses and grammar rules and started speaking to people and seeking help... I can easily tell you the present tense, preterite, imperfect, present perfect, present continuous, future tense, conditional, command form, present subjunctive, past subjunctive of all ar er and ir verbs and even of irregular verbs, i can tell you exactly the rules of when to use them, i can tell you about reflexive verbs and... It's just crazy how much I've been learning. Now I have reached B1 level but the thing is it usually takes a while to get there and I've been studying Spanish since april 2021.

languagelearning,Thoughts on learning French or Spanish?,"Hello everyone, 

My next semester of college is starting soon (I live in the southern part of the us) and I need to choose either French or Spanish. I have taken about 2 years of Spanish in middle school/high school but i've pretty much forgot everything except very basic things. I've always had and interest in spanish shows and the culture. I live in an area where there is a large spanish speaking population and I have a few friends that speak spanish but French has always seemed interesting to me since my brother has learned it even though I don't know much about it. It does seem harder to learn though and I don't think I would be able to use it unlike spanish unless I go somewhere but I am still undecided about what to learn.

languagelearning,Four weeks into spending 25+h per week studying languages -- a résumé,"First things first: Studying consistently for at least 25 hours per week is hard. And I'm honest, I'm not sure I'd have been able to do it if I wasn't able to watch shows and movies in some of my TL already as part of my studying.

That being said, here's a rough overview of the \~103 hours I've done over the first four weeks:

\-&gt; about a third of this time has been spent watching shows and movies in French and Dutch (with TL subs usually)

\-&gt; I spent a LOT of time doing vocab (those little bits here and there add up to quite an impressive chunk of time), estimating this to be roughly another third total (majority Icelandic, plus Dutch, and French reviews)

\-&gt; the remaining study time is split between reading (French and Dutch, plus some linguistic texts about French and Icelandic), grammar (mostly Icelandic, some Spanish for review purposes), listening to my current audiobook (French), and writing practice (Spanish, Dutch, and French)

Beyond what I counted, there were some chat conversations in Dutch, Icelandic, French, and Spanish throughout those weeks as well.

I've had days where I was able to get two or three hours of focused grammar study in. I've had days where all I could accomplish was a bit of vocab and watching a show. And a lot of days in between where I did a mix of things to get my hours in.

Going from here, I'm trying to increase my time spent reading again. I'm finally at a point in Icelandic where I want to start the graded reader I have (that's listed as A2-B1, so even the easier stories will still be challenging), and I've also started another French mystery novel yesterday.

Vocab will continue to be a major part of my study routine, as is to be expected when learning/improving several languages at the same time, but I'm perfectly fine with this. In general, I don't mind vocab study and may even enjoy it for its meditative qualities.

Grammar will stay part of my routine, mostly for Icelandic (I have three more online courses to go through via Icelandic Online) but also to review grammar for Spanish, and possibly to review specific grammar points in French, as well as to review and learn more Dutch grammar.

For now, writing will not be a main focus but I do want to get some more writing practice in consistently (for all TL).

I do feel confident that I'm able to keep up my challenge but it is, as expected, hard at times. What really helps me, though, is the ability to switch between languages and skills as my different TL as well as the different skills take different amounts of concentration.",1619283525,Miro_the_Dragon,38

However, I now have a job with the government so I've been thinking maybe I should give French a serious attempt. There's just something about German though that I continue to find appealing. 

I know personal interest plays a bigger part and would naturally lead to better results, but practicality must be a considering factor as well. I can't say I've given French or German my full effort, but I would like to fully commit to one and put some serious work into it.

My motivation for learning was for fun, I just felt like learning a 2nd language. So I don't have a job or anything riding on it.

Last few weeks/months I feel I have lost all motivation. My classes I rarely attended, when I did I often fell asleep. This was partially to do with being sick, busy with work and travelling.

So in the end I havent really done much spanish lately and with a new term of classes coming up I am wondering if I should just stop.

Like is there much point in just going through the motions, attending classes if I lack motivation.

Instead of spanish I was considering chinese.

Which ticks the box of learning a 2nd language but comes with the added bonus of I actually work with and know some chinese speakers where as with spanish I dont know anyone who speaks it outside of the class I was taking.

I guess the main issue is, if I stop spanish learning, have I just wasted the time spent so far?

languagelearning,Do Slavic languages put nouns at the end of sentences?,"People who don't have English as their native language tend to do different errors depending on their native tounge.

One thing I've noticed that people from Eastern Europe do is that they put the noun in sentences at the end. A few examples I've heard; ""Leave it alone, my bag"" and ""I love to eat it, the rice"".

Is this because of how Slavic languages are structured? I've heard too many Slavic people build English sentences the same way for it to be a coincidence. 

This is in no way meant to disrespect people from Slavic countries. I'm just curious to know how languages are built. German fascinates me just as much since they're the only Germanic language (?) that puts verbs at the end, like instead of ""I am reading a book"" it would be something like ""I am a book reading"".

Now some background. Before, i've learnt both german(3 years in middle school) and french(3 years highschool).
When i started highschool i had a choice to study german(basically to continue it from middle school) but i chose not to. The reason was because of my german teacher i didn't like her very much (i was afraid of her) and in my highschool that language was also taught by very unfair and strict teacher. So i opt out of it. Now i actually was quite good at german i just didnt like learning it because of that teacher and also i have never found great passion for it. 
So i started to learn french in highchoool and my teacher was wonderful! But the problem is that i absolutely can't grasp it. Neither the grammar nor pronunciation. 
Now should i pick german(the language i have no passion for and have some animosity towards it ) or should i stay with french that i am not sure i am capable of understanding or mayby should i choose a brand new language.

Band 9 in Coherence and Cohesion means you have structured your essay correctly in terms of using paragraphs and you've achieved cohesion effortlessly, without drawing attention to it.

To get Band 9 for Lexical Resource you need a variety of higher-level vocabulary, but the way you use it has to be natural; your errors, if any, must be rare and hardly noticeable.

I asked them their phone number and he said “323...” and then clearly didn’t know the rest in English. Then he says “六二六” and I heard it and knew to write 626!

languagelearning,"Pronunciation hack: listen to native speakers of your target language speaking your native language to see how they ""mispronounce"" words",I've been working on my Italian pronunciation and discovered a small but useful trick for refining your accent: listening to native Italian speakers trying to speak English. Analyzing how they tried to pronounce English words I know very well and mimicking their efforts helped me better understand how the tongue positions/mouth posturing of Italian speakers work and how I can make small adjustments to assimilate and use these different sounds/tongue positions to make my Italian pronunciation sound better. It might sound crazy but I swear it's helped my vowels and several consonants sound much more naturally Italian. Try it!,1619206296,martiniontherox,120

languagelearning,Forceful Chinese grandparents with our son,"My (Chinese) wife was born in America and her parents have lived here for 50+ years. Both her parents went to highschool here and haven't been back to China (unless for visiting). Having said that  they're both very very Chinese. They both have thick accents and are fully emerged in the Chinese culture (they read Chinese newspapers, watch Chinese shows on youtube ....). 

Since I am not Chinese nor do I speak the language, I speak English to my wife at home. Because of this, I don't really see us as a bilingual/trilingual family, since the only common language between she and I is English.

She and I, just had our first son and have noticed that her parents have become almost forceful when it comes to our son and the Chinese culture. I am talking about feeding my wife things like gross pig feet picked in vinegar to constantly speaking Chinese to our son and to my wife in front him just so that he learns and speaks Chinese. Again, I don't speak Chinese at all. 

This has become quite a problem in our household because I have become quite resentful towards them, not only due to some of their practices with our son but also for their complete respect and disregard of what we (mostly I) have asked them not to do with our son. For instance, I asked them not to teach him Chinese as I don't see him using it. My logic was, he won't be using it with my wife and I, and so since the grandparents will pass away in a few years, why would we want to delay our son's speech development. Regardless of the reason, they ignored our ask and continue to talk to him in Chinese (whispering in his ear) or talk to him in Chinese when we're not in the room (we see them do it on the baby cameras). 

Frankly, after marrying someone with parents in the Chinese culture, I have learned a-lot of negative things about the culture that I dislike. For instance, the rudeness of the people, the lack of warmth and family, how they almost refuse the learn or adapt to other cultures even though they've lived there for decades, how everything is about money, lack of manner especially when eating (chewing with mouth open, making slurping noise, farting/burping at the table, spitting discarded food, putting the chopsticks or fork that was in your mouth in multiple dishes and spreading germs (every single member of the family gets cold sores and has herpes)), how they are oblivious to their own cultural issues and flaws.... 

I don't know what to do and I almost want to shield my son from these things.  But at the end of the day, they're the grandparents.

languagelearning,Can small languages survive the 21st century? Should they? Will Icelandic survive English and Netflix?,"As somebody who loves languages and linguistic diversity, I'm really concerned about language and culture preservation.

English is a great language, like all others, and its spread has perhaps helped advanced science and other fields. However, its position as lingua franca has also had many negative consequences. 

The article [Behemoth, bully, thief: how the English language is taking over the planet](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/27/english-language-global-dominance) outlines those issues much better than I can. 

Small countries such as Iceland have implemented English education to offer better opportunities for its people. This is perfectly reasonable and understandable. Being monolingual is such a small language like Icelandic limits opportunities a lot. However, I wonder if a small language can survive having everybody be bilingual in English. 

[There are already reports of Icelandic children using English on the playground](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/26/icelandic-language-battles-threat-of-digital-extinction). If children grow up consuming most of their entertainment in English and writing/chatting in English on the Internet, it is only natural that they will start being more comfortable in English than in their mother tongue. 

Some may argue that is not worth it to preserve such a small language. Why fight the inevitable? In the end, becoming an English speaking country might bring more economic development. 

What do you all think? Is it worth it to preserve these languages and culture? Why? Is it even possible? How could you save the language and make it thrive?",1619198466,climatewarrior,113
languagelearning,Difficulty deciding between Japanese and Korean,"Don't tell me to learn Uzbek, as I'm already doing that.

As a fourth language, I can't decide which one I should learn. I'm way more interested in Japanese culture and language, but the impossibility and difficulty of Kanji even for native speakers puts me off. 

I started studying Korean as a substitute, but come across problems:

a) The pronunciation is insanely difficult, with even phoneticians arguing and failing to specify what exactly those 'tense' consonants are.
b) The spelling rules are overly complicated.
c) While those two could be overcome with enough patience and motivation, I just am not that interested in Korean culture. The language somehow intrigues me, but I'm afraid that too will diminish as the novelty wears off.

In contrast, Japanese is immensely easier to pronounce, is tied to a more interesting culture and in general just seems more fun. But I know there are thousands of Kanji that just have to be learned separately, each will multiple readings and all, and it all looks like an impossible task.

Should I force myself to watch some more KDrama / listen to KPop until I like it / gain some motivation for Korean? Or would giving Japanese an actual chance be more rewarding?",1619198279,anlztrk,8

Greek
Norwegian
Welsh
Icelandic
more European languages etc etc

Things to consider:
Two semesters is not a lot of time, but these are languages i believe i can get pretty good at on my own since they are the “easy” languages for English speakers. 
The Italian class is online only. :(
Spanish would be easier to learn since almost every label where i live also has the info written in Spanish.

I noticed that there isn't much good material for listening practice in Russian: most of it is outdated and the choice of topics is quite limited.  My personal opinion that trying to master all those topics offered by a language course (even the topics about frogs in Africa) is a waste of time, as you won't use that vocabulary ever again. It's better (and it's more interesting) to focus on topics you are actually interested in or need for your job. I've been following this approach when studying English and Italian, so I think it should work for Russian too. So I decided to create a channel on YouTube dedicated purely to the listening and the idea is to cover as many topics as possible in modern Russian: I read slowly the news. 
For those who prefer more classical approach,  I also read poetry and I'm working on a classical book creating something like an audiobook, but slower than proper audiobooks.

languagelearning,Reasons I believe school fails at language education.,"This is a short essay no one asked for but I want to post here anyway,

As you have read by the title, I will be talking about the 3 main reasons I believe schools fail at language education, Of course this does not apply to everyone since we are all different.

Without any further delay, let me begin,

1. Resentment towards a language.

In my motherisland known as Ireland, We have to learn the Irish language all throughout school. Now, I was lucky that I was did all my primary school education in the Irish language. However, The way it is taught in secondary schools is terrible! Like most other language school classes, They drill grammar, vocab and translation into you, grammar, vocab, translation, grammar, vocab, translation over and over again. This causes the student to feel detached from the language.

 The language should be a source of pride for us. Its beautiful and the Irish language has a rich history in its roots. Schools however make you hate the language as it drains all the fun and magic out of the language. They expect you to be able to form perfect sentences and have flawless grammar when they have not even taught the future and past tense!

2. Lack of motivation

Many of us forced to do a language in school lack motivation to do so. I will use Spanish as an example. Spanish is one of the most useful languages to know! But, Why force a language on someone they have no interest in. 

A lack of motivation can cause a student to feel bored, frustrated, depressed and angry at a language. If they feel strongly about their hate towards a language they may develop a hate for the culture, people and country where the language is spoken which is extreme cases may lead to Racism. 

3. Useful lamguages are chosen over exotic languages

One of the main reasons they teach a foreign language at schools is so students can use it after their education. Studies have shown though that students prefer more exotic languages compared to more spoken ones. For those who are truly passionate about a widely spoken language who is willing to self-study will have no problem finding resources for that language. Learning a more exotic language will also give students more knowledge of more diverse people groups and give them a sense of how truly diverse the world is.

Of course, This does depend on the person. Sorry for this little rant. Have a good day!",1619118761,Swimming-Guess-7154,20

For my mom's native language, I just want to be able to speak and listen, not read and write since I don't have any intentions of visiting their home country. For Korean or French, I'd want to learn everything. 

**Speaking:** 

I can speak my mom's language the best. The tricky part is that I understand the speaking structure of Korean better than French, but I can pronounce French words better.

**Listening:** 

My mom's language --&gt; Korean --&gt; French

**Reading:** 

Korean/French --&gt; My mom's language

I want to learn other languages, and I'm wondering, for those who speak more than two languages, do you guys always go through this nervous phase, or after you've done it once, do you have this ""fuck it, we're doing it live"" kind of mentality after you've been through the ringer with your second language?

languagelearning,Thinking about the most frequently used words lists.,"I started learning German and was wondering why do so many people ignore or never use the most frequently used words.

I tried Duolingo and after like 5 lessons/topics or whatever it is called, i started encountering such random and not-needed words that i have given up on it.

Instead, ive used Memorize and anki for the most used words. Memorize was great for words but no context, but Anki lists are also problematic as they have random and not needed words. (im in a process of doing my deck)

My priority is to get to communicative daily language. Instead, what do we get from most books or resources from the internet are things that prolong our language learning.

I remember watching a video from like 2014 from a Polish dude that knows like 10 languages. He said something like ""French language has over 100k words, Frenchman knows about 10k words(10%), But uses in 90% of situations only about 500, And in 33% of situations he uses only 25 words""

Its a really big topic, but looking at friends, family or people on the internet. Everyone is trying to learn more words than people who are natives in that language.

For example. What is the point of learning the word ""hive(bee hive)"" if even in my native language i dont remember the last time I have used it? So what is the point of trying to learn it in other languages?

&amp;#x200B;

People will say that ""you dont have to"" but even when im doing anki decks and im learning the word ""answer"", why it is put in a sentence with words that are like 30k on the frequent lists.

I have found some gems, that have like 200 words and based on these words, there are like 2000 sentences. And i believe based on it, you could have a normal conversation about everything and anything youre doing in your daily time.

I used this way of learning for a month, and i could watch my favorite tv shows in german and understand like 20% of them. Because in my understanding, if you know the most used words, the most used words are in every sentence that everyone is using.

Example:

""we need to go with the music""

""we need to go with the enemy"" 

And people instead of learning the ""we need to go with the"". Everyone is learning about the ""music"" or ""enemy"" words.

(if you understand the most used words, instead of enemy or music you can put anything there and you will understand from the context or something)

Im posting this as its boggling my mind, I dont know if im ""different"" or something, but im doing a way of learning that is working really well. After a week or two i could go on a german shopping website or restaurant and understand 80% of it. Meanwhile, people in schools are trying to understand times/plurals etc. while not understanding the basics

\[even now, i have used AND like 15+ times, I 25+ times. THAT like 10 times. THE like 25+times\] But people instead of learning and using the most needed or used words in different ways, instead learn more new words to the point that they will never use them, unless in schools.

And remember that im focusing on talking/learning about daily stuff. Because if you have learned or know the structure, learning or understanding what means or is ""french fries"" wont be a problem

1. *French* -  my L2 and the language I am most proficient in. I took it in high school and it's how I discovered my passion and talent for languages, why I became a linguistics major, and definitely a lifelong project for me.

2. *Spanish* - I currently work in south LA and meet so many Mexican and Central/South American immigrants that helped to spark my interest in Spanish. I also visited Ecuador and developed an interest in the culture (and food!). The fundamentals of the language are pretty intuitive and I would love to learn more and travel in Latin America.

3. *Mandarin* - a recent undertaking and obviously a huge challenge but I love it. The writing system is so daunting but it's beautiful, the culture is foreign and interesting, and I've been taking iTalki lessons with a tutor which is a  first for  me and has helped me make progress with my tones.

4. *Brazilian Portuguese* - I grew up in Southeastern MA  which has  a huge Brazilian diaspora, so I went to high school with a lot of Brazilian kids, there's tons of Brazilian markets, etc., and I  would love to learn some Portuguese to  connect more with that. Plus I love  the sound of the language!

5. *Wolof* - I'm really interested in learning a Niger-Congo language and Wolof seems interesting to me, mostly the way it sounds and the fact that a lot of  materials are in French.  My college offers an immersion study-abroad in Senegal with language classes in French which I would love  to do!

8. *Russian*

9. *Bengali*

10. *Farsi*

11. *Greenlandic*

12. *Finnish*

I decided to pay for Busuu because I also like reviewing my school french and keeping up with both languages.

My question is, I’m about halfway to A1 with both languages on Busuu. I’m probably realistically a bit further because some of the vocab is not new because of DW and Duo. With this in mind, how accurate is the A1 level of the Busuu McGrawHill certificates. 

I don’t need any formal certification but it would be good to confidently say I have A1 or A2 Level?",1619040230,JustaGirl762,4
languagelearning,Bidiread - a simple tool to create bidirectional readers from text files,"Hi all,

I've created a very simple online tool to create bidirectional readers from text files.  It's called Bidiread -- maybe pronounced ""biddyread""? -- and it's running at https://jzohrab.github.io/bidiread/.  It has some notes in its sidebar menu.

This tool is dead simple, but it could be useful for students like me.  And the price is super reasonable: it's free for the first hundred uses, and then free for every use after that.

The code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/jzohrab/bidiread) if anyone is a hacker and wants to submit code changes etc.

(I've posted [something similar](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/kvdmx0/a_html_file_to_create_a_2column_bidirectional/) before to this sub, but I recently figured out how to launch free sites to GitHub pages, so figured I'd put this together today.  As long as GitHub keeps offering this service for free, this will be up and running.)

Cheers all! jz",1619040137,-jz-,9
languagelearning,"Help! I need to start learning Arabic, and I am having trouble figuring out where to begin..."," 

Hello language learners,

I have recently been offered a job in Lebanon, and will likely be moving to Beirut at the end of the summer. The job did not require Arabic fluency, but as an enthusiastic learner, I see this as a fantastic opportunity to delve into a new language.

Compared to previous languages I have studied though, Arabic is daunting to start planning for. I have tried looking for places to start, only to see many online debates about whether to bother with MSA or go straight to Levantine Arabic. The resources available seem to be highly skewed toward MSA or the Egyptian dialect, though...

If you were moving to Lebanon and wanted to build a good foundation for communication, how would you start? Do you have any resources that you can recommend? Does starting with MSA make sense, or should I go straight to Levantine resources (which are not abundant from my initial searching)?",1619039283,MauBicara,8

languagelearning,In a Dilemma: Chinese or Japanese,"**TLDR at the bottom**

The title sorta gives the purpose of this post but whatever, I'm in a sticky self questioning with myself of whether I should drop Chinese (which I'm currently studying) In order to study Japanese. I've been learning Chinese for about a good year and a half now and can say I reached a point where if you were to drop me In China or Taiwan I could survive (Order food, basic convos, rent cars, etc.), I haven't reached the point though where I could confidently say ""I speak Chinese"". I can't express fully what I think about politics, or my hobbies, or my favorite history time period, etc.

As for Japanese relation to this I engage in way more Japanese media everyday than Chinese, even during days of hard Chinese study. For instance the games I play, the people I follow on social media, the music I engage with, all have Japanese elements imbedded to them. I don't feel the same for Chinese, It's a struggle to find Chinese content I'm passionate about, from movies to shows and games nothing peaks my interest. The one thing I can say Chinese encaptivates me with is the history and literature of China, which are the two things that motivated me to learn.

I actually originally studied Japanese before Chinese but gave up because it was ""too hard"" (AKA I was a naïve teenager who knew nothing about language learning and thought solely Duolingo would be sufficient.) As I got older and started learning efficient ways of language learning and what to do to be affective, was around the same time I got interested in Chinese history and literature, one led to another and now I was studying Chinese 

I enjoy Chinese history immensely, I could read about it for hours on end, and due to Chinas growing economic and political influence, as someone who is a political nut I feel like knowing the language would be more 'useful' per se. Yet in terms of media and people I engage with Japanese is constantly there, and there is more of a direct incentive for me be able to understand the language. But giving up on Chinese after nearly 2 years of dedicated study feels, off. Any Insight?

**TLDR;** I've been studying Chinese for a long time (2 years) though I engage with Japanese content and people at a way higher frequency than I do Chinese. I feel knowing Japanese would be more directly advantages, yet giving up on Chinese after 2 years fells like work down the drain. Any Insight on my situation.",1619030219,Soni-Z,14

I  plan to start Japanese this year and recently downloaded Memrise. I also want to complete the French course on it to brush up my French.

I would love to know the experiences of other people who use apps to learn languages. I am guessing there is a taboo in the community regarding learning languages from apps but for me its both fun and useful. Apart from French all the other languages are being self taught. Using an app keeps me regular and also helps in retaining the interest. I also think these apps make language learning more accessible and a fun thing to do.

languagelearning,Starting a bilingual journal,"In my own language learning journey, writing has always been the neglected middle child. But I decided to start a bilingual journal where I write a few sentences in my native language and translate it into the language I’m learning. I have found this immensely helpful for not only improving my writing skills but also my language skills overall for two main reasons: 1) it helps build my vocabulary in general and the specific vocabularies of the topics I’m interested in, and 2) translating and writing forces you to use the exact grammatical form required by the original sentence, whereas when I speak with someone I find myself modulating the sentence to fit the grammatical structures I’m more comfortable with.  

One drawback of this approach though is that, if you prefer to keep your journal private, your translations won’t be checked for accuracy. But I still think that the positives outweigh the negatives. As I progress in the language I’m learning, I find myself going back and checking previous entries for accuracy and correct any mistakes I find.",1619025233,Flashy-Passenger5332,2

languagelearning,Can reading interfere with listening comprehension?,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm finding it difficult to learn and acquire thing in my TL without using both listening and reading in some combination. For example listening and watching to a story then listening and reading together a the transcript. 

I find listening alone doesn't do anything, unless accompanied by some kind of context. which is difficult to find.

A recent example was watching and listening to a video; although I am able comprehend the general message, it feels like everything being said is referenced to an internalized mental picture of words and/or words in sentence.

&amp;#x200B;

The process might go something like this;

&amp;#x200B;

1.Audio/Video content (INPUT)

2.Mental picture of words/sentence conceptualized (from that Input)

3.Interalised ((Conceptually))

4.Comprehension

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of perhaps this;

&amp;#x200B;

1.Audio/Video content (INPUT)

2.Interalise ((Conceptually))

3.Comprehension

&amp;#x200B;

This extra step in the first list seems to be slowing me down, but I'm struggling to conceptualize information without doing this. Basically it's difficult to know if this a good thing to do, I've noticed I do this in my native language too, and it can be quite taxing.

SUMMARY QUESTIONS;

Is there a better way of conceptualizing the internalized written form of the information I have processed more efficiently?

languagelearning,"chinese, korean, or japanese?","hi everyone! i am interested in learning one of these languages, but i’m not quite sure which. i’ll give my reasons for wanting to learn each:

chinese: my end goal in life is to be an esl teacher. where i live in seattle, chinese is the most widely spoken language after english, with spanish being a close second. i’d want to learn chinese to help me connect and communicate better with my students, as most jobs are with chinese speakers. however, it’s not a guarantee that all my students would be chinese at other jobs, and i’d feel bad excluding others. i also don’t really consume any chinese media, and i don’t have anyone to speak with until i have students in the future.

japanese: my boyfriend is half japanese, and his mom is fluent being she moved here from japan. my boyfriend has been talking about learning japanese, as well, since he used to be able to speak it when he lived in japan. i thought it would be cool to learn in order to connect with his family more if we ever visit japan together (who knows with the pandemic), and i could speak with his mom, plus my boyfriend and i could learn together. i also watch some anime and listen to some j-rock. 

korean: i actually took a year of korean in college, but it’s been three years since that, and i’ve forgotten a lot but i can still read the alphabet/remember some basic words. i really wish i would’ve continued with it as i’d probably be pretty close to fluent now, so i’ve been thinking about getting back into it as i still have old textbooks/workbooks. i also listen to some kpop girl groups, but i don’t have anyone i could speak with, similar to chinese.

i love the culture connected to all these
languages, and i feel like i would be happy learning any of them. but based on general knowledge of the languages and what i said above, what do y’all think would be best for me to learn?",1619022957,genevuhhh,12

languagelearning,How can I regain my passion for the language learning process?,"I am a student at a very underfunded university that has to do with foreign languages, translation and interpretation. However despite this, we don't actually learn new languages and we're forced to do a lot of standardised testing without actually being taught much.

The last semester was particularly bad. I was doing assignments for 12 obligatory courses (Which weren't from past courses piling up - it's literally the standard curriculum that all students have to follow) and simultaneously having private lessons with my tutor for my German, as my university doesn't actually teach me anything.

But thanks to the amount of work I did at the previous semester, I faced a severe burnout. It was all too much for me, but I could not avoid it. In total, when adding up the word count of all assignments I did these past 3 months, I wrote 17000 words. I really want a C2 certificate for my German, but I hate the fact that my lessons are centered on tests, tests and more tests.

I lost my passion for this and I have started to hate this. I tried everything I can to make this fun again. I tried some exercises with flashcards, while simultaneously reading more literary books and listening to some podcasts, but in the end, I feel like I am simply forcing myself.

languagelearning,"Speakers of Japanese and Chinese, how do hanzi &amp; kanji /feel/ to you?","I want to hear how others experience these languages. I am learning both. I'd like to check with others.

The reason I ask: I have noticed that when I ask Chinese friends and Chinese-language learners what hanzi mean, they will often give specific word examples where it is used. They will say ""well this hanzi is used in the word '\_\_\_\_\_', or 'oh, this one is never used on its own, but is often used together with hanzi like (this) and (this)."" 

that's to say: they rarely actually answer the question ""what does this hanzi *mean*?"". This is fine, but it gives me the impression that they experience hanzi based on how the characters are used, rather than what's going on inside the characters as it were. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, if I ask someone what a kanji means in Japanese, be it an obscure one, one only used with other kanji, or a more common one like 音, they will often given me specific connotation, association etc. As with my experience, they seem to ""feel"" the kanji, almost like some have an aura around them.

Another example I could give would be that, if I want to say おもう (think) I have most of these to draw on. Each has their own connotation of e.g. ""thinking wistfully"", ""thinking longingly"", ""contemplating"".  
想う 【おもう】、念う 【おもう】、憶う 【おもう】、懐う 【おもう】、惟う 【おもう】

I remember an episode of One Punch Man where the main character is about to kill an enemy, and the character for Death 死 was layered behind him big in red  -- If you did this in English, it'd be weird just writing DEATH behind someone as they're about to deliver a killing blow -- it feels more like an affect or a motif than just a word. I don't see this kind of thing as much in Chinese media (what little I've seen of it)

languagelearning,"personal thoughts about ""language learning""","It is the natural process of understanding a language. Language learning begins at birth, then acquired in the continous progress of life. It rooted upon the discovery, inquiry, and collaboration assosciated with language using. Learning is commonly practiced on such environment where an individual is immersed with the people speaking a particular language. It is heavily reinforced during early childhood that's why the acquisition of the first language would usually see as a permanent thing for the ones using it. I definitely agree to that since it quite observable at some point in our lives. But knowing the idea that language is dynamic also push us to change our behavior in certain ways so that we can be better communicators. I think for me the best way to language learning is not by knowing it, people should encourage themselves to speak up, to put up a simple conversation with others and use that language to reflect on your own thoughts, actions, and experiences.",1618995569,Guilty-Airline-9611,1

languagelearning,My grandfather’s polyglot story,"There are various forms of “speaking” a language and I don’t wanna perpetuate the same myths youtube polyglots do. My grandfather is fluent in Tagalog, Kapampangan and English, he’s fairly advanced in Spanish, he’s conversational in Saudi Arabic and he can speak enough Italian to make himself understood. Here’s the story of how he acquired all of these languages. My grandfather was born in the province of Pampanga in the Philippines in 1936, during the time that the Philippines was still an American colony, he also lived through the Japanese occupation of the Philippines. His first native language is Kapampangan, the language of his ethnic group of the same name. His second language was English, Tagalog/Filipino was made the official language in 1937 but wasn’t yet widely spoken so English was still the lingua franca of the Philippines so he learned it at a very early age, much of his family already being bilingual. The next language he learned was Tagalog, one of the official languages of the Philippines, because of Pampanga’s central location in Luzon, the northernmost main island of the Philippines, it was implemented fairly quickly and he learned it in grade school. His fourth language was Spanish which he learned in school. Teaching and speaking Spanish in the Philippines was not yet discouraged at the time so he was taught it in grade school and later took more classes in college. After college he became a school teacher and eventually a principal but in the 1970s one of his cousins who was already living in the United States and was a member of the US navy gave him an opportunity to bring him and his family to the United States. He took this chance but in order to build up enough money to live in the country he began working as a manual laborer in Saudi Arabia, where he picked up some basic Arabic from speaking to truck drivers, taxi drivers and security guards, though he rarely worked directly with Saudis. Periodically he would return home to the Philippines, and later the US, to bring money and see his family before returning to Arabia, throughout this time each member of his family immigrated to the US, beginning with my grandmother and then with my mother, her four brothers and their cousin who essentially became adopted into their family, initially they lived with relatives in a small apartment in the Bronx, the poorest borough of New York City, before moving in with another group of relatives in a city in Northern New Jersey. For one year my grandfather worked in Rome as a manual laborer, before returning to working in Saudi Arabia. In Italy he was able to get around and make himself understood with the Spanish he knew along with speaking English to people who knew it but only picked up some very basic Italian. In 1982 the last member of his family came to the United States and my grandpa came the next year. They spent a few years in New Jersey but disliked the colder climate in the northeastern US so they later migrated to the San Francisco Bay Area, which is home to one of the largest Filipino American communities in the United States. Like most older men, he doesn’t actually share very much about his life at once, I learned most of this over time from him and from my mother and uncles. One funny story is when he met my cousin’s at the time boyfriend, who’s Mexican, and began speaking Spanish to him. My uncle was shocked, he had no idea his father could speak Spanish, in the US knowing 2-3 languages is impressive, let alone 6",1618976398,klingonbussy,6

I'm not sure how much the younger ones will be able to pick up yet, but I'm looking for a course or a method that can at be least be used for the older kids. I've been reading through this reddit but it seems that most people are learning languages as adults. Does anyone have suggestions for kids? Thanks.",1618974998,shammig,6

languagelearning,Repost from r/Linguistics Because It Was Removed on That Subreddit: I Feel Like a Different Person When Speaking My Target Languages,"Hello friends, and people soon to be friends! I am a high school senior and want to get my PhD in linguistics, not exactly knowing which field at the moment (kind of a pipe dream, but who knows). But anyway, to the topic at hand: “language split personality disorder” I would like to call it.

I learned Spanish throughout high school and always felt as if I was the most outgoing in that class specifically (I’m not an extrovert by any means, but more than usual), and never knew why. I started talking to different people in the online language learning space and realized I was not alone. Many people have this experience.

With Russian, it is the exact opposite effect. I become very shy and reserved, and almost cannot speak it in public because of how anxious I feel before speaking. I do have general social anxiety, like I feel most people do because they are putting themselves in a vulnerable situation, but it seems heightened when I try to speak Russian. I know many people also have language-related social anxiety when they try to speak their respective target languages, however, Spanish is no issue for me. It could be that since my level is worse, I am more uncomfortable, but I honestly do not know. I can speak Arabic and Italian a bit, but not to the levels of my Russian and Spanish. I generally don’t because I don’t feel confident enough in my abilities to speak, although I’ve heard it is beneficial to start speaking early on and disregard people’s opinions of your low-level mistakes.

My reason for posting this is that I want others’ inputs on this phenomenon, hopefully from people with more knowledge on the subject than me. I understand the difference between linguistics and language learning, but feel this could pertain to both areas. I am very excited to read your responses! Have a nice day/night, everyone!

And there you are! I posted a [video](https://youtu.be/y2sq0DyfrfE) outlining the scholarly article [u/Snorey](https://www.reddit.com/u/Snorey/) commented on my post before it was removed, and have linked the article in the video description.

languagelearning,Studying a language alongside a degree,"So my question is, to those who have done so or are currently doing so, how did you maintain your independent language studies/how are you maintaining your independent language studies alongside a degree? I would love to hear some or all of your tips, tricks, coping mechanisms or anything at all you found to be helpful in maintaining steady progress in your chosen language without hampering your pursuit of a degree.

Some context might help. I dabbled in some Finnish last year, didn't/couldn't fully commit because I smoked copious amounts of the sinister minister which isn't all the helpful when studying something so reliant on memory (who'd have thought...). Since quitting the stuff on NYE, I have fully committed and I have totally fallen in love with the process and the language itself. I can dedicate (and have dedicated) a lot of time to it currently as I work 07:00 - 15:00 Monday to Friday, leaves a healthy window to clock some decent hours when I get home. With all that in mind, lockdown gave birth to some serious introspection and self-evaluation and I have decided to go for a complete change in career which is where the plans to pursue a degree enter the picture. I'm not looking to start it until next year but I'll be doing some preliminary stuff in prep for it over the course of this year so I can get a gauge on how to balance work, Finnish and a degree - albeit a watered down version for the rest of the year so to speak. Like I mentioned above,  I'd be really grateful to anyone who would be so kind as to share some wisdom on how they've kept a healthy balance in a situation like this.

languagelearning,What language would be best for me? (Info is in the body),"Hi there, I’ve read numerous articles and read your wiki and I can’t believe I’m still undecided on picking between French and Spanish. I’ve been on and off both languages for a while but I want to start and reach a goal again without giving up as now I know it will take some time. 

I love both cultures and I have been to both countries a lot of times. It’s easy saying pick the one that is more interesting to you but they both are in my opinion. I don’t need it for a job or anything, it’s just for fun and to add a skill to my accomplishments. Both languages sounds incredible and so does their music. That’s one of my reasons for wanting to learn them. I don’t know anybody in my family that speaks either language. When I was in school (in the UK) they taught French only but it’s been stuck that way for too long. Picking French just because it is the nearest EU country to me would be absurd. Learning a language would be so cool and by me contributing to it I will help the language not die out in that sense. The thing that is not motivating is countries are learning English. Are French and Spanish dying or are they growing?

I just know that some people will say just go with Spanish because it’s easier but that doesn’t satisfy me enough just because it’s easy isn’t a reason to go learn that. I will sometime hopefully in my life know both languages but you need to start at one before that. Could people share what they think would be best? Thank you :)",1618937556,Effective_Sport_6487,9

I thought I would share in case anyone was thinking of trying it out.

In the two months I used it for free, I did find it a little more useful than some of the other flashcard apps I've used in the past. Firstly, because of the great pronunciation training. They have flashcards with similar-sounding words and you choose which one is correct. I'm learning German, so I've found this really helpful. But obviously, I can't speak for any of the other languages on there. Secondly, the word is always learned in the context of a sentence, and you have the option to learn more words from the same sentence as well. Again, with German, this is really helpful because of the challenge of word order (which they test as well). 

I don't love the flashcard creation tool. They only have Bing for the image search, and there are some weird pictures that come up. But usually, I can find something that works.

languagelearning,Tips on more efficient vocab learning? (reading and typing),"tl;dr: Learning vocab words seems to take a long time. Any tips on being more efficient?

Right now my main language learning grind is learning vocab for a short story in a book that has a few Russian short stories. It's definitely not the best way to learn a language I feel, but my main goal is to be able to read in another language and it's helping me develop a habit because this is a fun goal. Anyway, I find it takes me a while to learn the words. There's about 142 vocab words in the first story, so I split them into 25 word sets and made a Quizlet set for each 25. I've worked through about 125 of them, however the last 50 I can only somewhat identify (I can tell you what the Russian word means; I can't look at the English and say the Russian word, let alone type it; the other 75 of first 125 I can type and spell with some errors). I've been working on this for about an hour or so most days for a little bit now and I'm just wondering if there's a more efficient way to do this?



My current process is something like this (I go to the next step when I can do the current step pretty consistently if not perfectly):

1. Look at each Russian word, using Forvo to learn pronunciation each time it comes up. Use multiple choice English answers to start learning what the words mean.

2. Look at each Russian word, read it out loud, type English answer (from memory, not multiple choice).

3. Learn to spell Russian word by hearing it and seeing English meaning. 

4. Learn to spell Russian word by seeing English meaning, no hearing the Russian.

I thought about trying to not learn each word so deeply. aka learn just to identify if I saw it, but not worry so much right now learning to see the English word and know the Russian word, or be able to type/write the Russian. In other words just do step 1 and 2. However after trying this more superficial learning with about 50 words I can tell my ability to read them is wayyyyy worse than the words I know how to spell (duh). So this quicker learning isn't an option IMO.

Last year I dove into French and started learning a lot. It seemed like such an easy language to learn because my native language is English.

I want to learn Thai because I plan to live there for three months early next year. But... Wow. 5 tones, dozens and dozens of letters, an entirely different alphabet... It just seems like so much. 

I found a great method for French but for Thai it seems like it won't work. My method was using tons of memrise/anki to learn words, babbel for grammar and then just reading/eriting/listening/talking. 

I guess... I'm just wondering how to start on such a difficult language. I guess I should learn the alphabet first and go from there?",1618884738,Vtron89,23

The child gets shy when speaking the national language, which is the only one we share. I get shy a bit as well actually but he will sometimes start to say a sentence then stop and tell me not to mind instead of taking the risk. He will also not respond to open questions if he doesn’t think he will be able to easily. I would like to encourage him a little bit but don’t really know how. 

I like both the mother and child very much but I am not used to children and I have no idea what to say or how to act around them. I am trying to change this, but also he is used to speaking his own language with adults, schoolteachers being almost the only exception.

To complicate things my accent in the national language is very strong and it will be weird for him, he knows no-one else from my country. To further complicate things his mother does not speak this language, her second language is my native language, so it is impossible to communicate with them both at the same time.

languagelearning,Any Verbling teachers here? What do you think of recent developments on the platform? Anyone considering migrating to iTalki entirely?,"Hello fellow language teachers on Verbling! I've been teaching on the platform for 2 years now, and I've quite enjoyed the platform, until quite recently. I was wondering if there are other teachers who were having doubts about Verbling now.

Before Busuu acquired it, I appreciated the fact that tech support, despite being slow, actually tried to solve your problem and communicated with you in a personal fashion, unlike the chain-email system on iTalki where no one actually reads the email. As a woman, I also liked that they acted more swiftly on the creeps on the platform than iTalki did.   


However, my impression is that the tech support is super overwhelmed (even more than before) since Busuu acquired it. The glitches in the classroom have become more commonplace, and the Verbling management's attitude has worsened. First, my auto-sync with Google started having way more problems, and I was basically told they could not fix it. This was a feature I really liked over iTalki. The platform suffered major blackouts recently. I did not like the way they introduced the new pricing system and how they announced it, either.   


To make matters worse, the management recently posted a reminder saying how we're not supposed to teach on alternative platforms like whereby or Zoom when Verbling crashes, without acknowledging Verbling's problems or even telling us they are working on improving the problems. They instructed us not talk negatively about Verbling with our students... And today, they disabled the Paypal money transfer option because of a glitch. Is anyone else growing tired of it? I'm already on iTalki, so it'll be easy to migrate... But is anyone else considering this option? Any suggestions? Thanks in advance :)",1618848015,multilingualTCK,2

languagelearning,How to have better pronunciation? My experience,"Disclaimer: I'm not an expert in any of this, I'm just a student trying to help others. This guide may apply to other languages (Though you need to look for the resources yourself).

**In summary:** I wanna help you and here is how.

**SECTION I: Phonetics**

I had some issues with pronunciation, so I took a course on [American English Pronunciation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/american-english-pronunciation) which teaches you the essential phonetics of the language, I didn't really finished it I just cared about the phonetics, It's free if you don't want the certificate. (I only did the 2 first courses, The consonants and the vowels)

^(If you're learning another language besides English you should look for a similar course for that language)

***What are phonetics? And why should I care?*** ""Phonetics is a branch of linguistics that studies how humans produce and perceive sounds"". Very dedicated people studied each sound a human is able to make and assigned a symbol to it (called API symbols) and also studied how to make those sounds, let's see the words ""[This](https://www.wordreference.com/definition/this)"" and ""[Think](https://www.wordreference.com/definition/think)"",they are represented phonetically like **/ðɪs/** and **/θɪŋk/** respectively, although both words start with ""th"" they are pronounced differently, for beginners these littlenesses can be difficult to notice and many would end up pronouncing both words with ""**ð**"" or ""**θ**"" so it's a good idea to have some basic knowledge of the subject from the start. It also helps you distinguish similar sounds easier like ""p"" and ""b"" in ""[Park](https://www.wordreference.com/definition/Park)"" and ""[Bark](https://www.wordreference.com/definition/Bark)"".

***I don't wanna learn American Accent, British Accent rocks.*** It's fine, you don't have to, a gentleman (or gentlewoman) was kind enough to compile a series of resources that can help you with that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/mtqvha/do_you_know_of_any_british_english_pronunciation/gv23lie?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and to clarify some things about the British Accent. If you struggle with a specific sound you can google ""How to make x sound in Received Pronounciation""(In the x you put the API symbol) for more instructions on how you should control your articulatory system to achieve the sound.

***Alright, I get it, but how am I supposed to remember every sound? Am I supposed to remember each symbol?*** You don't need to remember the sounds nor any symbol, but rather remember each word as a whole, and using the symbols only as a guide when needed, sounds hard but there's no way around it.

Thankfully we live in a modern era with tons of tools to help us in this process.

**SECTION II: Anki**

If you're familiar with anki, skip to section III

***What's anki?*** ""Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.""- From anki's webpage. That doesn't really answers any questions, does it? Anki is a flashcard program, in one side of the flashcard you have the ""question"" and in the other side you have the ""answer"".

***What's so special about it?*** Anki uses a Space Repetition System (SRS) to help you remember things, and it supports a variety of things like mp3 files, images and videos in your flashcards (But we're only going to use mp3 files)

***SRS?*** ""The SRS (Spaced Repetition System) is a presentation method that gives you the information *before you would forget it* and makes sure that it stays constantly fresh in your mind. So, you might see a word a few minutes after the first time, then a few *days* later, then a few *weeks* later etc. always at the time you need to see it most to make sure it is constantly fresh in your mind."" -from [this](https://www.fluentin3months.com/spaced-repetition/) page

Get anki from [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), it's available for all mainstream platforms

**SECTION III: Remembering with Anki**

We might be able to pronounce some words correctly but we often find ourselves forgetting how to pronounce them. This might help you with it.

Now we have all the elements necessary to make a powerful deck to help us remember how to pronounce words. When you find a word that's difficult to pronounce for you, you get the audio (more on this later), look for its phonetical pronunciation (in [here](https://www.wordreference.com/)) and make a flashcard.

***Wait, you're going too fast.*** It's okay, just read. I'm not going to go much in depth about how to make flashcards. To add a flashcard to your deck you click on ""Add"" (I'm using the pc version of anki). In the ""front"" section you write the word, and in the ""back"" section you put the audio file (click on the clip button and look for the proper mp3 file) and also write the phonetical pronunciation. An example would be: **Front:** Maintain **Back:** /meɪnˈteɪn/ \[sound:maintain--\_us\_1.mp3\]. (See image 1)

&amp;#x200B;

[Image 1](https://preview.redd.it/u27dd8m8j3u61.png?width=451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da60754f6bc1111b771c120af9bbbf28ea8d4632)

***How to get audio files?*** This is more or less complicated and tedious. But here's an easy way:

[American pronunciation](https://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/oxford/word--_us_1.mp3): https://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/oxford/**word**\--\_us\_1.mp3

[British pronunciation](https://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/oxford/word--_gb_1.mp3): https://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/oxford/**word**\--\_gb\_1.mp3

**What the heck is this?** It's a link to the audio files of oxford's dictionary, here's how we're going to use it: Where you see the word ""**word**"" you change it to any word you want, example: 

For ""**junlge**"" 

https://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/oxford/**jungle**\--\_us\_1.mp3 

(It doesn't works with some conjugated words, for example, if you look for ""worked"" you might get a 404 error)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fi77hqodl3u61.png?width=344&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9618e4f7a27efc96a1e00b71338caff860b81ee

Once you're in the page of the audio file just click the three dots (...) and download it.

^(I'm going to make another post on how to get audio files from other sorces in more detail.)

Congrats! You now can make an anki deck with all the words that are difficult to pronounce for you.

***Now, how do I use this deck?*** Simple, review your deck, when you see the word, try to pronounce it, click on ""show  answer"" (see image 2) and if you pronounced it correctly click on ""Good"" otherwise click on ""Again"" (see image 3)

&amp;#x200B;

**This is only a helpul method, it's not a magical solution, it's just a gear piece of a big engine.** You need to listen a lot, a LOT of the spoken language and speak it yourself, only hard work will make you fluent.

**This is not the rule.** If you don't see yourself doing any of this, it's fine there are more ways in which you can achieve what you want, I'm only making this post in hope to help others, I'm not claiming this is the way you should learn but rather the way that was helpful for me.

**Only use this method if you already know the meaning of the word.** Learning words by their own can be misleading, many words have different meanings depending on what context they're used in, If you want to learn new words, learn them in context. Example, let's say you want to learn the word ""throw"" making a flashcard with just ""throw"" and it's meaning in your mother tongue isn't very helpful. It's easier to remember ""I threw an apple in my teacher's face"" it sounds interesting, funny and that helps you remember it better and you can also see in which cases the word is used.

languagelearning,Languages and Videogames," What do you think about using video games to learn foreign languages?   
 I think they are a very good tool. In the past, video games were very simple and had very little text, if any at all. For this reason, it was easy to understand how to play, even without translation.  
 Later, games began to have more complex plots and better graphic aspects, so the text became much more important. Although most games were developed in English, even a basic knowledge of the language was enough to understand how to play. At least in my case, this was the beginning of a virtuous cycle. On the one hand, studying English let me progress with the game, and on the other hand, the more I played, the more words, terms and grammar I learned.

More recently, video game companies have tried to launch more and more products in foreign markets. For this reason, translations were needed. Most of the time, it became possible to choose between many different languages within the same game. This let users find the equivalents of one or more words. Amazing!

For these reasons, I think that video games are not only a way to have fun, but also a learning tool! What do you think? What are your experiences?

In the process, I was wondering how alike and interchangeable the languages are between each other (Korean vs Japanese vs Chinese). I noticed their alphabets - rather characters - and pronunciations differ drastically so I automatically assumed a native would have to learn a completely different language as I believe there is no prior connection between the languages. However, the countries are in close proximity so I imagine that there have to be some similarities between them right? how difficult would it be for say a Korean to learn Chinese? would it be the same as a Spaniard learning german for example?",1618806859,jzspeedo,1

languagelearning,I’m having trouble trying to pronounce this name,"I’m playing a game called Twilight princess, and there’s a character named Ooccoo in the english version. Her name in Japanese is おばちゃん (Obachan, which means auntie according to the wiki). I’ve always pronounced it “ook-koo”, but i’ve heard other people pronounce it as “oos-sue”, and it’s clear that there’s no proper way to pronounce it.

While I am a writer, I’m not expert on the english language and i’m having a hard time trying to find a proper pronounciation, or at least, the closest I can come to a proper pronunciation. There is only one line of voice acting in the entire game, a incomprehensible chant, so there really isn’t a way to pronounce it officially.

languagelearning,Grammar is important (and can save lives),"I often argue with others on this sub that grammar is important and it's always good to learn it, and others often say that even if you make some mistakes in the grammar, you'll be understood anyway. Well, of course... but not always. I found a perfect example, but it concerns the use of vulgarisms.

In Polish there are two words that are synonyms and have three different meanings. It's ***zajebać*** and ***zapierdolić***. Both mean: 1) ""to steal"", 2) ""to hit someone"", 3) ""to kill someone"".

So, where's the trick? In case of the first two meanings you use those verbs with the **Dativus**, e.g. *Zajebałem mu portfel.* – ""I stole a wallet from him"", *Zajebać ci?* – ""Do you want me to hit you?"", *Ktoś mi zapierdolił temperówkę!* – ""Someone's stolen my pencil sharpener!"", *Trzymaj mnie, bo mu zaraz zapierdolę!* – ""Hold me or I'm gonna fuck him up!""

But, if you want to say ""to kill someone"", you need to use the **Accusativus**, e.g. *Ja pierdolę! chyba go zajebię!* – ""Fuck me! I think I'm gonna kill him."", *Zapierdolę cię jak psa.* – ""I'll kill you like a dog."" (although Google translate translates it as ""I'll fuck you like a dog"", no, that's not right)

So, **it is important to know grammar**. There's a huge difference between ""I will hit you"" and ""I will fucking kill you"" (*zajebię ci* – *zajebię cię*). That being said, are there any examples in your native or target languages where a tiny mistake in grammar can change the meaning altogether?",1618785849,Leopardo96,28

* I am C3 in Mandarin, B1 in Spanish, A2 in Korean. Spouse is Korean.

languagelearning,Is it problematic to have a mixture of accents when speaking in your 2nd language and constantly switch back and forth?,"To clarify, I'm aware it's not problematic per se.

But say, as a native Spanish speaker that was taught American English in school/consumed a lot of American content, and therefore mainly speaks with an American pronunciation/accent, but throughout the years also started consuming British and Australian content, is it weird for me to pronounce some words like the latter as well?

So kind of like a mix between American, British and Australian. Take the word ""water"". I feel more comfortable pronouncing it the American way or with the aussie accent, but never in a British accent. Then again, with the word ""fatally"" I keep pronouncing it with a British accent. This usually happens with words that include R/T/D sounds; I just find some words easier/more natural to pronounce with one accent than with the other, but I guess everything ends up sounding a bit inconsistent.

Is this something problematic I should change? I'm not sure if it'd seem odd to hear someone switching accents in one single conversation lol and I don't want to seem like I'm trying too hard or anything like that either.




P.S: By the way, I know accents and pronunciations are two different words, but I wasn't sure how to phrase/correctly use them, so I'm sorry if I worded some things weirdly. Regardless, I hope y'all get what I mean. Also, sorry for the lengthy post lol. 😅",1618780795,voguedoux,16

I've been looking at doing one-on-one lessons because that's all that's available with the pandemic, and I was wondering what others' experiences were like.  It's a little expensive, but I have the free time and money to do it right now, which might be a rare opportunity that I'd like to take advantage of if it's worthwhile.  I know there's a kinda DIY bent to language learning subs, but I have ADHD and I just do WAY better if I have structure imposed on me externally.  Plus, I usually learn pretty quickly, so I figure with individual lessons, I can move as quickly as I'm able to, which kind of maximizes my investment.  

As you can see I'm leaning pretty heavily in that direction.  I suppose I'm more asking for stories and experiences than yes/no advice.  I live in the Metro DC area so there are a lot of schools for diplomats etc., but the specific company I've been looking at is Listen &amp; Learn USA.  There are good reviews from both students and employees (Indeed, Glassdoor, etc.), but if anyone has used them before and could share their experience that'd be awesome.

Part of the reason I'm looking for private tutoring is because my target language is Tagalog, which, despite being the 4th or 5th most-spoken language in the US, is weirdly difficult to find good resources.  I have some books already, flashcards etc. that have gotten me about to tourist-level skills lol.  I live with my Filipino girlfriend and her dad, but they aren't really up for teaching unfortunately.  I tried online tutoring but had problems finding good teachers and kept having connection/sound quality problems.  Plus, online learning is a bit of a struggle for my ADHD symptoms.  So yes, I am aware of other resources, but I'm really serious about achieving proficiency and I'm looking to invest in something more rigorous.  I'm just wondering if anyone else has gone that route and what it was like for them, if they found it worth the investment.  Thanks!",1618758485,bigwetpoops,6

I'm native English and live in Australia but I'm very proficient in Japanese (I never like saying fluent because I feel like I never stop learning new things) I'm planning on trying to have a family and was wondering if I should speak both at home and teach my kids. I started learning 15 years ago because of school and just fell in love with the culture and language and continued learning on my own after graduating.

Theres no real benefit considering I live in a rural town, aside from maybe future travelling or job prospects if they want to move out of the countryside, and theres only white Aussies here. I'm just wondering if it be a good idea and acceptable culture-wise considering im not Japanese? 

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!",1618754539,Spicy_lil_chilli,9
languagelearning,I can't decide,"I've been wanting to learn a language for so long now, but I just can't decide. I started learning Russian, but I stopped because I got demotivated for personal reasons. I really want to learn Russian but I haven't got any use for it. I just think that it's so good to speak. 

So I decided to leave learning Russian and find something much easier for me to learn, enter Spanish. I'm a Filipino and because we were a Spanish colony for 300 years, the language is much easier to learn, because I already know a lot of words. 

So here's the deal. I really want to learn these two language. But I want to speak the language as soon as possible. What language should I choose? 

I'm also self taught, I don't have money for tutors because I'm broke af. So, if you have a personal experience the same as mine, please tell me the way you learned. I really don't know where to start. Should I learn phrases already? Should I focus on Vocabulary? Should I ignore grammar?

languagelearning,Literal translations &amp; Reverse-Engineering language,"Does anyone else think literal translations and reverse engineering are really beneficial to learning a language? This goes for both vocabulary and grammar.

For example ""Kraftfahrzeug"" in German seems like a mouthful, but if you dissect it you get: ""kraft"" (force, power) + ""fahr"" (drive) + ""zeug"" (thing) = powered drive thing: a motorvehicle. In French ""aujourd'hui"" (today) can be split into ""au jour d'hui"" (on the day of today), hui being old French for today. Spanish does mirror this construction with ""hoy dìa"" which is often said instead of just ""hoy"". ""Zdraveite"" is Hello in Bulgarian, except it isn't, it is derived from a Bulgarian word zdrave, which means health. When people say hello in Bulgaria, they are actually wishing the other person to stay safe and healthy.

Reserve engineering grammar structures can help you understand the logic of that language (for example, the word order) and to ""think"" like a native speaker.

Of course I don't advise going around translating sentences word-by-word when actually talking to people, but I believe it could be a good learning process. What do you make of it?",1618744566,r1ckeh,10
languagelearning,Is writing skill the most difficult skill to master?,"Hello guys, I want to open a discussion based on the title:)

Background story :

So my L1 is Romanian, L2 is English, and right now I am trying to learn Japanese and Norwegian. 

However, I feel like even if I got 7.0 (C1) CEFR on my IELTS exam last year my writing is still not so developed as the other skills (I personally assessed that my speaking/reading/listening skills) are my strong points. 

I have written over 300 essays (CAE/IELTS writing tests) and, as I have mentioned previously every time I write something, I have a feeling that something it is ""off"", and it is not the fact that I do some mistakes or typos.. just the overall writing content seems wrong to me ;-?? 

I might say that I am a Visual/Auditory learner, might be this the issue? Moreover, I am an utterly talkative person, I really enjoy to socialize and I am not doing well when it comes to express my feelings .. even in my native language, do you think that my personality has something to do with the fact that I consider my writing skills underdeveloped, and to be honest...most of the time I loathe to write.. 

Sometimes I think at numerous things when I write, and I consider that I cannot express all of them by writing (if that makes sense ?) 

Since I am learning Norwegian and Japanese at the moment, I feel the same hate towards the writing component of the languages.. I am able to memorize a sentence extremely quickly.. but when it comes to writing, here we go again my mind goes blank..

Thank you for reading this, and I really want to know your opinions regarding this.",1618744511,Commercial-Body-7146,33

languagelearning,Read well in Italian but not able to remember words in conversation?,"Anyone facing this problem or is it only me? 

It’s such a breeze (and pleasure !) reading my first Italian book (a crime novel aimed at natives)  even though I’m only weeks into learning it because the number of words that I have to look up doesn’t impede the flow of reading, and in fact it’s easier to understand than my current Spanish novel  ( in part due to the more straightforward plot). I honestly love the headstart I’m getting for reading comprehension, and in fact it’s my primary goal- to be able to read in IT.

I attribute this to the fact that Spanish and Italian are really similar (not only in terms of vocab but also grammar structures), but that’s when the problem comes in.

I come across words that I’ve not seen before frequently but due to the similarity between the 2 languages I instantly know the definition (I know I’m correct because the sentence makes complete sense according to the definition, not because they’re fake friends or whatever).

However when it comes to conversation it’s hard to recall these words, and in fact I forget them. What should I do? (No, I don’t do SRS or flashcards)

But then in later life A has grown more confident, increased status, and has regular relationships with peers, now seeing himself as B’s equal.

languagelearning,Tandem almost gave me a panic attack. Any tips on how to use it better or less overwhelming alternatives for output practice?,"So, a little background: I'm pretty advanced in Spanish and intermediate in French, but that's only as far as input is concerned. I rarely practice output, so my writing and speaking are lagging *way* behind my reading and listening. 

I hate texting, so I downloaded a pen pal app called *Slowly* to practice my writing. It's a pretty great app, but *a lot* of people have no idea how letters actually work, so most of the time you'll wait for a couple of days for a letter to arrive and it will turn out to be something like:

&gt;*""Hey! How are you doing? I suck at introductions. Let's be friends?""*

It can be pretty annoying, and it makes it really hard to find someone you can actually connect with and have interesting exchanges. When you're also looking for people with a specific cultural/linguistic background, it's like finding a needle in a haystack, so I just gave up on using it as a language exchange app (I still use it, but now it's just to make friends).

Well, my need for output practice took me to an app called *Tandem*, which is actually made for language exchanges and has inbuilt video and voice chat functions. I made my profile, waited for a few minutes for it to be approved (which I thought would take a lot longer), and barely a few seconds after I logged in, it was like someone had opened the floodgates. Within a few minutes, I had over 20 people messaging me, guys and girls. Some seemed to be teachers implicitly advertising their services. Most were people who wanted help with English. Others didn't seem interested in languages at all. I didn't find a way to block the influx of messages, all I could do was block people, but when I did that, new people started popping up. I have attention issues and agoraphobia, and I was actually feeling the symptoms of a panic attack, so I just deleted my account and the app, even though there were a couple of people who seemed genuinely nice and interested in language exchange.

Obviously, not everyone will have the same reaction to the overwhelming amount of messages you get when you make a profile on this app, but I really feel like this is something that they should improve. It would be so much better if you had the time to check out the other person's profile and see your shared interests and language learning goals before actually starting a conversation. At the very least, they should add an option to temporarily ""de-list"" your profile (or, if there's already one, make it easier to find). Or even a limitation on how many new people you can meet every day, or maybe every hour.

I've read some complaints about this around the internet, but they were made by female users, so I just assumed the issue was caused by men being assholes and using it as a dating app rather than an actual feature of the app itself, but either I'm *way* more attractive than I thought I was, or the devs actually intend for you to be juggling dozens of language exchange conversations within the first hour of downloading their app, which seems like an awful decision to me.

Anyway, did I do something wrong? Is there a way to use this app without being overwhelmed by people messaging you (and immediately asking for a video chat...)?",1618709543,loupdufromage,8

In addition, I love reading and writing, so being able to use a language skillfully and with wit is of much importance to me.

Another reason is that I do not have strong motivations for learning French.

languagelearning,A year and a half of study and finally feeling the *click* of understanding,"Hi all! I wanted to share a language success story and also just a general experience learning for people who are slow learners or think of themselves as bad at language learning. I'm a native English speaker from the USA and started studying Spanish regularly in September of 2019 with absolutely zero background in it. I was recently watching Street Food: Latin America with Spanish subtitles, a little high, and realized halfway through I was understanding everything, all of the tenses, what they were saying, and the words I didn't know were food or locale vocab I had just never seen before. It was the first time I felt like I clicked into the language fully and was just enjoying what I was watching for what it was. It's probably my proudest achievement so far, especially because I consider myself a slow language learner and not naturally good at picking up language. 

I took French in school and hated, hated, hated it, I hated memorization, I hated grammar, it was intensely boring, and even though I was able to travel to France many years later and be able to use enough of the language to get by with 0 English, I still thought of myself as uniquely bad at language learning (thank u US public school curriculum). I really struggled trying to start with Spanish, and this sub was immensely helpful in re-framing my efforts. I knew I wanted Spanish to be conversational for me, so for the first year I focused almost exclusively on listening and speaking. I got an iTalki tutor from day one so I wouldn't be shy while speaking and started listening to the Duolingo podcast even though I didn't understand jack shit, and watching a lot of Spanish tv shows with english subtitles. I did all of pimsleur and had an anki deck (which I've now abandoned) and a grammar book that took me over a year to work through lol, but I got through it. Once I reached an A2 level, I started listening to things all in Spanish aimed towards learners or children (No Hay Tos, Dreaming Spanish, Peppa Pig etc). The main thing I really focused on was input and not stressing about not being able to fully understand things, and doing something every day, even if it's only for 15-30 minutes. 

My listening skills are now way above my speaking and writing levels, but that's fine with me, especially since it seems like that's the thing many people struggle with. I would say writing and speaking are A2-B1 and listening is B1-B2, reading also more B1. I'm shifting now to sorting out all the grammar I need to fix. I hate grammar so much, but I've been enjoying Kwiziq and how it keeps track of what I need to work on, because I definitely would not make myself go back and revisit a grammar concept, and reading comic books or YA books. I'm also using Langcorrect to practice writing. 

When I get frustrated, I remember I take classes fully in Spanish now and can understand everything that's being said, all within a year and a half. I'm so glad I was able to find this sub and for all the people that contribute to it, because before I really thought the only way to learn a language was to go through dusty ass grammar books, rote memorization and being bored out of my mind. I'm finally getting to the point where I can really enjoy a lot of input for regular people and it's starting to become really fun for me, which is good because I know I need an exponentially larger amount of input now haha. Also I have a fun excel spreadsheet for my study hours, which is really motivating.

All that to say, if you feel like you're not good at languages, just be steady with it and it will come, even if it's later than others! No one is inherently bad at learning a language, it just takes time and consistency and not putting a ton of pressure on yourself. It feels embarrassing sometimes that I'm still at a A2-B1 level over a year and a half in when people talk about how they get to B1 within a year, but that's not my problem and it's not a race :)",1618672472,colleentie,32

languagelearning,Discord server: for Chinese heritage Speaker … but where do I even start with studying,"So a bit about me, I’m British born Chinese and my parents are Malaysian Chinese. I went to Cantonese school and only spoke Cantonese at home. I think for me it was really hard with learning Mandarin because I wasn’t really going from 0, but then I wasn’t exactly at intermediate level in terms of pronunciation. It just felt like it was so difficult to start studying and get some momentum going with mandarin. 

Going into university, I never really thought I was really ever going to be advanced in Mandarin, but here I am at the end of university and didn’t take any single class and still was able to take myself to an advance level. 

Here are the things I did and what skills did it target: 

&amp;#x200B;

* Read aloud to a Mandarin native speaker friend helped iron out my issues in Mandarin. This made me realise that alot of common mistakes and these were all quickly ironed out
* Messaged in Mandarin to people on hello talk and university international students and used a translator when I didn’t know the word(s). This really helped me increase my vocab and see the difference between Cantonese and Mandarin, but it also exposed me to a lot of new vocab. 
* Translated sentences from English to Chinese using the pinyin keyboard. I would direct translate (translate a sentence word for word) these sentences, then tried to write them out so the grammar was correct. Then I would try to notice where the main pinyin issues and also searched up the answers. I got some of my native chinese speaker friends to proofread them and correct them when necessary. 
* Spoke more mandarin with people who were patient and voice noted them, but I’d say its best to practise with people who know mandarin and cantonese cause it can really sped things up the more I compared Cantonese and Mandarin. 

Now, I’ve made a Chinese heritage server and we have a few channels focusing on learning Mandarin for native English speakers, as well as learning Mandarin for those who speak Cantonese in addition to English or any other languages.

I have a few months to prepare and right now I'm not working. I'm staying isolated for the next few months, have my entire day free and I'm good at intensive study. I'm seriously considering signing up for *both* and putting in 20 hours a week. I actually got the posting and end up there, it would be 4-5 years so I'd improve over time but I need some initial competency to get started. French is just official documents, nobody really speaks it, and Swahili is no one's native language but it's a lingua franca. Unfortunately ""fluent in google translate"" doesn't work in places where you might have 2-3 hours of internet on a good a day.

I just need to get to the late beginner level or approaching intermediate. Basic structure, everyday vocab, numbers, set phrases, and in Swahili starting to internalize the noun classification system. At this point I'm pretty much free to pour all my time into it. I am fluent in Spanish which might help and I did a linguistics minor in college for what it's worth (probably not much here).

There are only a few places where I feel like I'm naturally using Spanish. I like reading, so when I read a book originally in Spanish, generally I learn about a culture that I never would have learned about without learning Spanish, and I do it in an enjoyable way. There's a guy called Ezquizofrenia Natural who has a channel about a lot of topics, a lot of which I'm interested in enough that I don't feel like I'm watching something in Spanish just to learn Spanish. The last way that I can think of is when I'm looking up how to do something and I search in English and Spanish just in case. 

When it comes to interacting with native speakers, I haven't interacted with a native speaker of Spanish long enough in Spanish(though there are some I knew before learning Spanish) to develop a relationship that I would consider ""natural"" though I'm doing my best and hopefully one day I can become good friends with someone who I wouldn't have ever known without learning Spanish.",1618608452,Steve25_,4

So, whilst reading Stephen Krashen's book ""Explorations in Language acquisition and use"" I came across the practice of ""Total physical response""; a method of acquiring language through action. Something I'm sure this community is very familier with.

Upon reading, it got me thinking ""How could someone as an adult implement these ideas/methods/practices into an *at home* Situation?. Clearly these methods are and have been designed for classroom use, predominately for children (and adults too) but surely there must be a way to implement these elements into a private setting.

An idea comes to mind about some-kind of series or program that immerses and engages someone through various TPR activities, perhaps some-kind of software exists for this?. No gimmicky YouTube channels, forced grammar instruction or overly wordy content, just a very action-originated program designed to acquire the language through engaging interaction. 

Just to make clear, this isn't to replace reading and listening, as they are both very useful, but I can't help but feel this is the missing link; firstly because it makes up so much of how we acquired language in school and also how we think in language is based from physical experiences.",1618596719,Oz390,3

I got interested in the Viking's early trips to what is now called America, and I got talking to some history lovers about it.  We were talking about the tribes the Vikings would have met, and the word Skraeling came up. A word one of the Vikings came up with to describe the look of the people there.  Now, I know for a fact that is new on the fly word that someone came up with. I know because I have done it myself. Years ago now, I took an interest in etymology,  going so far as to guess at and assign meaning to the individual letters. The result was I felt like I was breaking up a lot of my received education and further use of words from throughout my life. Frankly, It was hard on my brain, I could nearly feel the consequences going on up there. Yet, there I was, looking around my room coming up with new descriptive terms for what I could see.  

I was left wondering after the word Skraeling came up, is it a common thing that people find they can do when they explore language? Come up with completely new descriptive terms that flow from the gob.  Is it special, related to my sort of doggedness going after 'full etymology'?

**Please guide me!**

Donating money to help destitute people in emerging countries can never solve the actual problem of poverty. Many countries provide economic assistance to other countries to improve their people’s poverty conditions and other necessities. Eventually, it never helps them in any way because corrupt intermediaries and government officials gulp the whole money, which was supposed to help deprived people.

Instead of donating money to other nations, the donation party should work on real issues. For example, they should encourage those nations to build hospitals, education, companies, etc. As we all know, how bad corruption has become in many countries. Many countries are spending assistance money on their lavish programs and securing their own future rather than spending money to help deprived people. The present situation in some countries has become so bad.

The United Nations provides abundant assistance to many countries, but those countries never pay attention to improving people's basic needs. In my opinion, it’s better to encourage them to build hospitals, education institutes and set up businesses instead of giving a hefty sum of money.

Assisting with money would never help them always, as we have seen, how badly some miscreants misuse the financial aid. Needless to say, the donation money never reaches poor people because of corruption.

Despite paying them, the donors should collectively talk to their representatives to build basic facilities. Sometimes, most countries demand financial or other assistance for some unfortunate problem that occurs in their countries. In those cases, It's legit to help them in any possible way.",1618569431,dauglasbaba,7

According to Google, the translation for sisyphean is sisyfán. Obviously, there was no actual being Sisyphos, that's just a myth. Did the ancient Greeks make up a story around the word sisyfán, naming their main character Sysiphos after the word? Or were those stories somehow around before the words that they inspired came to be (i.e., did they really not have a word for endless repetitive toil before someone thought to adopt the name of the guy from the story)?

I'm sorry I don't have a better example, the general question has been mulling around in my head for awhile, maybe someone who gets the gist will have a better one.

languagelearning,Vocabulary Retention? And when’s the right time to stop using Kindle?,"Long post. Summary: Asking for advice for vocab retention. Then, asking about when (from your experience) is the right time to switch from Kindle to physical books. 


So I’m reading my first actual book written in the language I’m learning (French). I’m using my Kindle. Right now, I’m doing quite a bit of looking up in the middle of my reading (I.e. not just highlighting and moving on), because of the ease of looking up with my Kindle. The ease makes the reading still enjoyable, despite the interruption of reading flow.


My problem is how to retain vocab. It feels like I’m forgetting the definitions too quickly. Sometimes forgetting the definition of a word I just read a page or two ago. Very frustrating. 


Note: I do try my absolute hardest to recall and/or use context before I look up a word.


For some words, if it comes up multiple times in one sitting/reading, it becomes easier to recall the definition each time. But by the next day or next sitting, the words/definitions are either fuzzy (I have to look to verify because I’m not confident) or completely forgotten.


One thing I’m trying to do is, at the end of a sitting, I quickly go “reread”... looking over the words I’ve highlighted and rereading the sentences that have those words. Basically a review. 


This isn’t bad as long as I’ve only read 10 pages or less in a sitting. But sometimes I read more than 10 pages, so rereading is less appealing in those instances.


But I’m apprehensive about this method, wondering if it’s actually helpful. I might be memorizing the word as it is embedded in a SINGLE example/sentence. Instead of trying to learn the word itself, as it is standing alone. Thus making it hard to understand the word when I see it in a different sentence . If that makes sense.


Any other suggestions for vocab retention? I don’t prefer to do flash cards. However, I don’t mind keeping a notebook and writing a word on one side and the definition on the other side (Cornell notes style). Somehow this is very different from flash cards, in my opinion.


But I’ll try whatever anyone suggests. At this rate, I’m can’t imagine ever switching to a physical book (where I would need a dictionary to find definitions). My reading is very enjoyable right now as long as it’s easy to look up what I don’t know.


Which leads to my second question (which has three parts lol): How many books did you read on your Kindle before you felt comfortable going to a physical book? Did you survive and continue with physical books from then on, or did you have to switch back to Kindle ? When did reading physical books become a more permanent method for you?",1618517719,Aliroo58,8

My dad is an immigrant from scotland (glasgow specifically) to the US.

So I wanted to start learning a celtic language. But I want it to be one I could actually use. I know that celtic languages are kinda dying out (but they are being revived).

Anyways, I want to learn a celtic language I could actually use over in the UK or ireland. I considered scottish gaelic, but it seems that there aren't that many speakers in the more populated areas of scotland, as they are mainly on the islands and highlands (my dad is from the lowlands).

I also considered Welsh, cause there is a significant population in Wales that uses it in day-to-day life with other Welsh speakers. However, the community is smaller than Irish speakers

Irish is interesting cause it is the national language of Ireland. Trouble is, most people speak English in their day-to-day lives. So I am not sure where I could hear it or use it. I am also only a citizen of the UK, not ireland, so I couldn't spend that much time in Ireland easily.

I would like advice, what do you do when you get tired of the language? Should I continue to C2? Should I switch to another language and take a break from English?",1618493281,An_invisible_starman,11
languagelearning,Is it easier to learn a language if your native language is more complex than the one you're learning ...?,"Hey everyone, I don't know if this has been already discussed. Let's say that one's native language is quite complex and difficult, a fusional language with complex declensions for example. Would it be easier for natives of a linguistically more complex language to learn another non-related but linguistically speaking a more simple language compared to people learning the same foreign language but their native language is not that complex?
I know this may not make sense but I was just wondering if we already naturally comprehend some grammatical concepts (we do not have to learn the concept of application of that rule but just to be aware that the rule in a language exists and pay attention to it) are we more advantaged than those who simply do not?

For example, a native Russian speaker who learns French or Spanish will naturally understand that different nouns have different gender, he will be aware of the subject-adjective agreement, subject-verb agreement and so on. He'll only have to learn how it works in those languages but the concept itself will be familiar. 

I suppose it should be a bit trickier for a native English speaker to grasp all of these concepts because English does not have anything similar to it. On the other hand, English and French share a lot of vocabulary so English speakers win in this area. 

I know this is a really broad topic and opinions might differ drastically but personally I noticed that it is actually easier for slavic languages or baltic languages speakers to learn other languages compared to English speakers and given that all of them follow the same learning program and accordingly should dedicate about the same amount of time to learning the language. Obviously, it's hard to say if that really is the case, but this is just my observation. 
 What are your opinions on this matter? Do you have any other exemples regarding other languages?",1618492174,ppaauulinute,20
languagelearning,Parents are against me studying Korean and Japanese for my career,"Hello,

Sorry if this doesn't really match the theme of this subreddit. Suggestions to post to other subreddits will be appreciated.

I will be going to college this year and will be majoring in Comp Science.  I plan to use Korean and Japanese in my professional career as well, focusing on Korean. I'm considering a minor in Korean/Japanese/Linguistics. I want to study abroad in Korea during university and take the TOPIK and JLPT exams. I've been seriously learning Korean for two years to TOPIK 3 and have started learning Japanese.

My parents, particularly my mom, think me learning Korean is ""completely useless"" and a waste of time, and I would much rather I do something else. She sees it as nothing but a hobby. I was considering doing this online Korean course over the summer break after graduation. Still, now my mom wants me to fill that time doing calculus, something I absolutely cannot stand.

My mom has even said some extremely ignorant things, such as ""Will Kim Jong Un give you a Job?"" ""I want to burn all of your Korean books."" ""You're going to marry some Korean guy, aren't you?"" and a plethora of others. She even went as far as saying that she ""hates Korea"" because of me.

Now, the reason she is so adamant about me not learning Korean is that I'm not doing too well in AP Calc BC. So to compromise with her, I told her that'd I'd stop studying Korean and Japanese temporarily until I take the AP exam, after which I will studying Korean during the summer. At first, she seemed to tolerate this, but now she doesn't want me to study Korean or Japanese at all, stating that I can ""pursue my hobbies"" after I graduate, something I don't want to do.

I feel like she has some sort of hidden prejudice towards East Asians, and has always resented the fact that I learn Korean and Japanese, just merely tolerated it. She has sometimes suggested that I learn Arabic, and work in a Middle Eastern country instead since we are Muslim, or Urdu and Hindi. At first, I thought she was only encouraging me in my language learning, but the recent events say otherwise.

I also believe that she thinks I've been ""brainwashed"" by Korean Dramas, which is funny considering I don't watch Korean Dramas very much at all, and is not my motivation behind learning Korean.

**How can I convince my mom that learning Korean and Japanese will actually help me in my career? How can I convince her that this isn't merely a ""hobby"", and something I may seriously pursue?**",1618491151,Confused_Muslimah127,316

***---------------***

Road safety is the biggest concern today. Many people violate the rules and regulations of road safety, and due to that, traffic accidents are increasing. The finding says that if we impose strict punishment for driving offenses, we can reduce traffic accidents to a great extent. 

In my opinion, I firmly believe that the government should impose strict punishments on offenders who violate the law. After making some changes, it can reduce road accidents. 

Road accidents are growing rapidly than ever because vehicles are affordable to buy. People are buying vehicles but not paying attention to road safety. Lots of new vehicles with modern technology are coming into the market. But the government is clueless that they are not imposing strict fines and punishment to reduce it. 

As far as strict punishment is concerned, the government should also make some other strict laws to handle this. Like, passing a driving test every year should be mandatory because people never pay attention once they get their driving license. 

Another thing is that the government should renew a driving license every year once a driver gets a passing mark in a driving test. By doing this, this thing can avoid traffic accidents to some degree. In my opinion, there should be another thing, which is important, is to put violation strikes. If a person violates the rule 3 times, his/her driving license should be revoked forever. However, this strike should not apply to a serious offense but to a driving violation incident where people drive being drunk or break the rule. In serious offenses, the government should cease the license forever without giving a strike. 

To sum up

Until the government makes strict laws, it will not reduce road accidents because the drivers have become careless. Strict punishment is the only way to cease road accidents.",1618477001,prakashnielit,2

* 8.8 seconds per card (the front of the card is in English, the back is in Spanish, I have to type a response)
* \~8600 sentence cards (mostly from articles and books read in Readlang.com, iTalki sessions), \~2K Cloze cards extracted from a [grammar book](https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Makes-Perfect-Complete-Spanish/dp/1259584194)

Main takeaways:

* My vocabulary and grammar in conversations have improved. I simply don't often have to search for how to express an idea, since there is probably a card I've memorized that covers it. To be honest, I was very surprised that there would be so much crossover. With that said, I've also done a lot of reading, listening, and conversation, all of which were also helpful.
* I'm still quite far away from where I want to be. My guess is that once I'm at 20-30K unique words, I'll be more a effortless speaker/writer. There are still tons of collocations and vocabulary which I can understand, but not necessarily use.",1618472456,naridimh,24

If you were gathering input from reading materials, were you using graded level reading material or did you learn from trying to just approach a book that you enjoyed?

4. Mimic what's being said (pause between each line)
5. read the notes (actually read the notes first)
6. Do the exercise (spend a good 10-15 min on this, these are easy)
7. See if you can produce a sentence in your target language without the book then compare your work

Currently, I'm trying to learn German, I already have a B2 certification in it and I've been living in Germany for 2 years but the problem is that I can't use the language properly yet, I can't have good conversations with it, sometimes not even small talks and I'm having a big problem understanding people especially if they talk fast. But I can read it really well and I have no problem understanding written texts. 

I know that many people will say I have to speak german with the natives and force myself to use the language, but this is why I think I'm blocked, it's because I use the language everyday, at work I'm only using German, I speak German whenever I have the opportunity and I've been doing it for the whole 2 years that I've been living in Germany but still I can't notice any progress, people at work always have to adapt to me and speak slowly and use the language in an easy way for me to understand them. During meetings I always have trouble understanding what they're saying and always end up picking up a only half of the ideas which make work harder for me.

I've already learned a few languages such as French and English and I can use them very comfortably, I'm not that good at them but I've never had this problem while learning them.

Japanese: I love Japanese culture, history and anime. The language itself is fun but it's more what it leads to. (Japanese for the culture, media and people only a little for the language itself)

languagelearning,A Beginner's Review - 101 Conversations for Beginners (Spanish) by Olly Richards,"TL;DR at the end
___________________________

This is going to be a long review. I do want to preface where I'm coming from before you decide to read the whole thing. I'm an A1 Spanish Beginner, having taken Spanish for two classes in college. My mother tongue is English. This was originally going to be me talking about ALL my resources, but I inevitably couldn't stop writing about this one, so here's the book review...

# Why would you choose this book?

Imagine. You're a total beginner. You speak English. You're sort of nerdy and interested in trying to find legitimate methods of learning langauges. No shortcuts or cheats. Just legitimate ways of learning. 

There are a ton out there. 

* AJATT
* L&amp;R
* Speak From Day 1
* Anki/SRS/Cloze
* Pimsleur/Rosetta Stone
* Classes, Textbooks, etc. 

So what makes this book different? This book is **tailored** to the section of the language learning community that have heard the **Gospel of Krashen's Comprehensible Input** (CI). Despite the decades that it has been around, there are very few resources that have been created that allow for remote learning to occur using CI as a methodology. 

Lo and behold, I see an Olly Richards video interview with Krashen, and when watching it, I realize that I'm actually starting to STRONGLY agree with Krashen's methodology. And a few months after, Olly came out with 101 Short Conversations, and they follow a remarkably similar pattern of thought that his Krashen interview seemed to touch upon - namely, the **stories** aspect. This connection I had to the methodology was strong enough that I could convince myself to trust the process, and as a result, I chose to use this book as my jumping off point. 

# Comprehensible Input and How A Good Book SHOULD Work

Over the past decade or more, Krashen seems to have evolved his theory of Comprehensible Input. It's ""i+1"". However, there's a problem - When you're a total beginner, you're starting from Absolute Zero. CI is meant to act as a **vector for acquiring material knowledge** in your target language, but when you're at Absolute Zero, that process can be incredibly difficult to build as a habit. In Krashen's view, the reason *stories* are such incredible forms of comprehensible input is because they are **great tools for acquiring knowledge**. Does this mean all you'll need is a book of short stories to learn a language? Of course not. 

What it *does* indicate is that at some point in the process, there has to be ***compulsion!***

If I may be so bold, I would like to draw a comparison to what **Anders Ericsson**, the Swedish psychologist whose work Gladwell derived the ""10,000 hour rule"" from, said about **deliberate practice**. In order to truly achieve some level of mastery, **one must deliberately focus with great intensity on a task in order to improve in it.** 

So how do we engage in language learning *deliberately* with a book of short stories? 

Well, the starting place would be the *content* of the book itself.....**it must be interesting to the user**. Without spoiling anything, I can tell you that the story, while almost childlike in how simple it is, is actually VERY well structured and organized. I feel no shame in having attempted to read a book that, now in reflection, is actually SUCH a simple story and plot that it shocks me that I was so enamored with figuring it out. But it's that feeling of WANTING to figure out how the story goes that kept me going. It was that compulsion towards moving forward that kept making me read more and more.

&gt; ""But /u/AttakTheZak, couldn't I do that with any other book in my target language?""

Yes, random internet person, you could! This is actually something that the Listen &amp; Reading method does as well, but I think it would help for people to understand the structure of the book to realize why it's so practical 

# Characteristics of the Book 

* **Every conversation was a scene in the story** 

* **Every conversation had a select few words at the bottom with translations, leaving the rest up for you to figure out**

* **Some words that appeared earlier without definitions are later on defined**

* **Conversations are short enough to fit one page** 

The instructions for reading (roughly) were as follows

1. **Read The Entire Conversation** - This meant that the very first thing you would do was read the short context piece at the beginning that set the scene and then read the dialogue exchange that followed

2. **Don't Look Up Words Till You Finish The Conversation** - You're not allowed to look up definitions during the first skim. The whole purpose is for you to ATTEMPT to gain the gist of what's going on. As hard as this may seem at first, you realize that as an English-speaker learning Spanish, the phonetics and diction are so scarily similar that you're usually pretty good at capturing the ideas and emotions of the scene without necessarily being able to repeat what was said between the characters.  

3. **Read The Entire Conversation AGAIN....But With Help** - The 5-6 words/phrases that were defined at the end of the conversation are used during the second read. I highly recommend that people refrain from trying to solve the entire conversation and/or using outside dictionaries. It ruins the mood of the whole thing when you just ruin the game of figuring out wtf ""preguntamos"" meant. If you treat the story as a puzzle, consider the second read to be your 'serious' attempt to try and create some educated guesses on certain words and phrases. 

4. PICK ONE OF TWO CHOICES: **Re-read or Move On** - There is no metric for what it means to ""get the gist"" of the story, so this is a user-based choice. My recommendation when you see a lot of words you don't know, do your best to try and *make* them have meaning and then to say ""FUCK IT"" and just move on to the next section. This has been beneficial in that I have avoided getting lost in solving stupid squabbles that normally might come up with grammar rules and I have been able to move at a comfortable pace and feel like I'm making progress. 

This general set of instructions at the beginning, while simple, is an absolute MUST FOLLOW for beginners, even if they're not using this 101 conversations book. 

# Things I Like 

* **The conversations are short enough to read without getting overwhelmed but also long enough that you feel like you're dealing with a lot** - This is the problem I have with bigger books being used by beginners. So often, you're not dealing with palatable content that is just enough for you to digest but long enough that you feel that there has been some form of action and progression in the story through the conversation. And if you're reading a novel where nothing happens for an entire paragraph, the entire process can become WAAAY too overwhelming. Imagine trying to read Thomas Pynchon in Spanish using a method like this? It would be a nightmare. 

* **Easy To Reread** - Despite how big ""101 Conversations"" might sound, they're actually very short conversations, and that helps because you're going to be re-reading them....a LOT. One thing I didn't mention earlier was the number of times I had restarted the entire story. I've probably done it a couple dozen times at this point. I would read 2-3 conversations, work hard to get the gist of them through a few reads, and then spend a lot more time trying to determine the context. Once I felt like I had adequately gotten the new sections down, I would start from the beginning and start tracing the story. This is a HUGE benefit, because your progress through the book is mirrored by the words you learn as each paragraph continues. So while you may not know ALL the conjugations for *conocer*, you can recognize the word *sorta* and you can *sorta* get the gist and you can *sorta* feel confident as to what's going on, but then you'll go back to the beginning of the book, and you'll read the first conversation, and you'll see a word that also looks *sorta* like *conocer*, and you play around with the meaning of the sentence in your head. Suddenly you develop a more nuanced ""feeling"" for the material, and as you progressively re-read the material, old content becomes more familiar, less ""confrontational"" in terms of fighting for the meaning, and you stop thinking about the language and start thinking about the story. This, according to Krashen, is the key to **acquiring** a language. 

* **Kindle Version** - A great aspect to this is that, because I use a Kindle, I've actually adjusted the instructions to add in different colored highlights for different words. The select vocab at the end of the conversation end up getting tagged pink, while OLD words that I had PREVIOUSLY seen were highlighted blue. This became especially valuable when I would reread conversations and notice that old conversations were becoming more and more clear due to what felt like 1) knowing the story development, 2) knowing more words, and 3) having a visual representation of progress (lots of highlights means I should know 80% of what's going on)

* **Comes in Audiobook version** - I managed to snag the kindle books and audio for an early release promo. The audio is essentially a much longer extension of Olly Richard's Conversations, which is another program that is meant to help Intermediate Spanish Learners how to listen. Given the price of THAT series is a little under $200, these short conversations are MUCH BETTER investments for beginners to make. 

* **There are no mistakes, only discoveries** - if you know anything about the **affective filter**, motivation and drive are strong factors for language acquisition. With this method, there is no ""mistake"" in translation, only a discovery of a ""new understanding"". There is no one to smirk or to correct you. There is no annoying SRS to repeat the mistake for you so it can confirm you know it. Because part of the process is ""fast &amp; loose"", you're given the space to relax and ""think"" you understand something, while gradually coming to terms with what's actually being said. 

# Cons

* **Olly Richards Is Expensive** - The dude has some GREAT content, and I respect his hustle. But holy shit, if you want to follow your Spanish journey **after** this book, you're better off finding similar resources that challenge you in a similar manner. With Spanish, there are a plethora of books and you could surely repeat the process even if the book is a bit more challenging but don't put a hole in your wallet. I would have loved to have tried his beginner courses, but its ridiculously expensive and I think I legitimately found a solution that is WAY cheaper

* **Dumb down your expectations** - I used to try and watch kids shows to try and learn Spanish. I was never interested in the plot. Couldn't hold my attention. They all felt like they were either going too fast or were too boring. So with this book, understand that you're not gonna be reading Tolstoy. This is pretty much a 4th grade reader that's been shortened and chopped into conversations. These books deal in mystery. Not just the plot, but the method itself. Eventually, after enough re-reads, you start to understand that you're reading pretty simple ideas and the mystery sort of dies down. When you start to get this feeling, it means you should move on to the next section, where you will inevitably find more mysterious words that take you for a wild goose-chase. This book feels like it's attempting serious situations, and as a result, your ego as an adult doesn't have to suffer through boring and slow kids material out there. 

* **Slow process** - This is gonna be a doozy of a stretch. Patience will be key, but if you're properly involved with the story like I was, you'll forget that you're even learning. 

* **This is not all-encompassing** - Listening, writing, and speaking skills are not going to suddenly show up. You'll pick material up. You'll acquire some things. But language learning isn't a single book. You're going to have to diversify your practice in other ways for the future. 

* **Replicability may be tough for other languages** - as someone that wants to learn Urdu and Pashto, which uses a completely different script, different sentence structure, and has waaaay fewer phonetic similarities, I'm not gonna have such a well written resource like the one Olly has made. I will have to figure out a way to mimic this, but that's for another post...

# Other Resources 

I would be a fool if I didn't actively use multiple resources to keep my interest going. 

* **Memrise: Mexican Spanish** - currently going through this still. Marvelously succinct tool that does the job I want Anki to do, but in a ""friendly"" way. I found myself acclimating to the language a lot easier with these decks. 

* **Dreaming Spanish** - One of the BEST CHANNELS ON YOUTUBE!!! I have only seen 3 other creators on youtube who employ CI in their videos, and Dreaming Spanish beats all of them (granted, the other 2 were for Japanese, so maybe I'm being harsh lol). He has MULTIPLE videos for SUPERBEGINNERS that are pretty much just video extensions of the practice methods of the short conversations book. It's shocking how simple it is to transition from trying to guess words in a book to trying to LISTEN for words and trying to figure them out. I would like to remind you that you should be actively rewatching these videos over time in order to better your listening skills. I would love to see more channels like this on youtube for other languages, because they seem to have cracked the code. 

* Deliberate Spanish - I don't understand anything, but I have already come to the conclusion that this channel is where I will inevitably end up at at some point. The exercises he poses are legitimately quite intriguing. Not a beginner's channel, but one that provides exercises that could most definitely be molded for other languages. 

* **Easy Spanish** - The Easy Language channels are great resources for multiple reasons, but primarily for their literal authenticity. I never realized how relaxed everyone sounds when you ask how they are. The response is so genial (pun intended) and you get to hear how people stutter and use 'gap' words like ""pues"" or ""uy"". I think this is another listening resource to use as a beginner, but also as an intermediate and advanced user. Given the breadth of videos, you can get a LOT of practice out of it. 

* **How to Improve Your Foreign Language Immediately by Boris Shekhtman** - a marvelous book that gave me some of the most succinct and useful pieces of advice when it came to strategizing how I would approach the material I wanted. 

# Is this unique? Groundbreaking? Game-changing?

languagelearning,Proverbs and sayings in languages other than English," Hello kind Redditors! 

I'm seeking proverbs and sayings in other languages that mean the same as (American) English proverbs and sayings. I don't want literal translations, but different symbolism to express the same meaning.

I became intrigued with this idea when I thought my Ukrainian ESOL (English for Speaker of Other Languages) student wasn't telling the truth -- I told him he was pulling my leg. He didn't understand, and when I explained the meaning, he replied that I could have said he was hanging noodles on my ear! 

Besides ""pulling my leg"" or ""hanging noodles on my ear,"" what would you say in another language to indicate you don't think I'm being honest? Here are some other examples of *what I might say* to express something. How might these be expressed in other languages?

\-Something is very expensive = *It costs an arm and a leg*  
\-To give up = *Throw in the towel*  
\-It happens very rarely = *Once in a blue moon*  
\-Faced with two difficult choices = *Between a rock and a hard place*  
\-End a quarrel or conflict and become friendly = *Bury the hatchet*  
\-To pretend not to notice = *Turn a blind eye* 

I'm also seeking proverbs. Do you  know of proverbs in another language that mean the same as any of these? Again, not literal translations, but the same meaning.

*-Don't judge a book by its cover. =* Don't make assumptions about a person based on their appearance.  
\-*Every cloud has a silver lining.*  = Every bad situation has something good come from it.  
*-Actions speak louder than words. =* What a person does is more true than what s/he says.  
*-Beggars can't be choosers. =* Someone who depends on the generosity of others should take what they are given.  
*-The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.* = We are never satisfied with our own situation, and think others have it better.  
*-Practice makes perfect.* = If you do something over and over, you will get better at it.

Please add more if you can think of them!

I've been researching this on line for several days, and have asked my friends who speak other languages. Now I turn to the Reddit community to learn more.  I will use these sayings for a category in a trivia night, and it's been a fun and challenging exercise. 

I'm crossposting this, and I think that's okay per the FAQs I've read. Mods, please accept my apologies and delete if this isn't allowed. Thank you in advance for your help!",1617999322,mincky,0
languagelearning,The first words and phrases in different languages. What are yours?,,1617998907,Caramel-Guilty,1
languagelearning,"Anki and best cards (fields), strategy","I have been studying Spanish for about a year now. For first 4 months of this time, I've even lived there. Idk what my level is, but I'd estimate it at around B1. I still have troubles watching spanish movies/series with spanish subtitles with ease.. 

Recently I've come across Anki. It seems highly recommended. I read a lot about it and found different approaches. Some say one word + translation and pics. Some say only production, some only recognition, some both, some suspend some of the production/active vocab cards if they dont need them, but keep them in the passive/recognition version etc.

I decided it's best to make my own deck. Now, I have made my own templates, 2 actually. One for vocab and one for Phrases, Idioms etc. which spanish has a lot of. I made several fields also. I would really appreciate if you guys could review my cards and give me your opinion.

Question I ask myself:
-Are they effective? 
-Should I remove some of the fields, make it simpler?
-Should I include conjugations and how (i still make mistakes, when talking, but i think conjugations arent such a problem anymore)?
-Is there a better approach to phrases/idioms?
-Should I have a note type for grammar and how?
-What the best type of sentences to use (lengthwise for example)?
-My native language is Slovenian. Is it okay if I have one field for English and one for Slovene or should I just have one? (the thing is some idioms are really similar to my native language, others to english, some words that dont exist in slovene but do in english or vice versa, some words i know in english but dont know the native equivalent. I often help myself with both languages to link stuff in my mind, Sometimes I even use croatian. I dont know if thats okay or if im just being inefficient, so i dont know if its okay to have English and Slovene fields or should i just stick to one and which one?)
-Should I turn fields on Back cards also into buttons, to avoid too much info if i dont need it? 






Here is my Anki Layout
As I mentioned I have two note types.

1. First is Vocab and I intend to use it for nouns, adjectives, adverbs etc. or maybe even some phrases or idioms too (maybe e.g. ""acabar de..."") depending on what they look like.

I have three card types:
1) Spanish--&gt;Eng/Slo 
2) Eng/Slo--&gt;Spanish 
3) Eng/Slo--&gt;Spanish but i have to type in the word

2. Second type is named Grammar, Idioms, Frases. I intend to put in stuff like ""ponerle los cuernos a alguien"", ""no tener abuela"" etc. Grammar because i hope it will indirectly give me more feel for when to use some preposition or articles (e.g. In poner los cuernos, i always forget about ""los"").

Here I have two card types:
1) Spanish--&gt;Eng/Slo
2) Eng/Slo--&gt;Spanish with an added clarification if needed and a sentence mimicking cloze deletion with the help of colors (because sometimes it could be difficult to know exactly which idiom anki expects from me, when there might be more than one way to say it)

Both note types have the following fields:
1. Spanish
2. Slovene
3. English
4. Clarification (for if there some clarification needed to differentiate it from same word that has a similar/different meaning, not needed for all card types)
5. Example (this is made for sentences)
6. Definition (one user recommended to learn words by reading their dictionary definitions in the target language, so i made one field for that, but not sure i will use it often)
7. Picture
8. Additional (i have this to jot in any additional notes about specific grammar, some kind of explanation i might've read somewhere etc)
9. Source (where i encountered this word, whether its a website, video, movie, maybe a personal event, like talking to someone, whatever it may be; i also read this is useful)

Most of the fields are set to not be shown if i dont type anything in them and on Spanish--&gt;Eng/Slo most of the fields on Front cards are set up as Buttons, so i can only see them if i click. Additional and Source buttons are only shown on the Back cards and always as Buttons.

languagelearning,Studying a language always makes me feel better,"So this is gonna seem a bit pointless but I wanted to share for people who might be in a similar situation to me.

Last night I made the rookie error of speaking to my ex and, despite us being 'friends' now, I got myself in a bit of a state after finding out about the fact she'd been with someone else. What does this have to do with languages you ask? Well I was in bed, heart racing I mile a minute and just really upset about finding out all this (believe it or not I have no intention of getting back with this girl, I just don't like hearing about what she's been getting up to) and I just felt so hopeless for some reason. I decided I was in no state for my italki lesson in the morning and I was on the verge of messaging my teacher and asking to cancel but eventually I didn't. I woke up this morning and still felt terrible and considered a last minute cancellation but I didn't. I'm so glad I didn't. 

I've just finished my lesson and I feel so refreshed and with much more sense of purpose. Learning Chinese when I'm not at work gives me such a sense of accomplishment in my free time and something to strive towards. I think about the year I'll be spending in China and it just makes silly issues with my ex seem so irrelevant and I'm so much happier. That's not to say I had the lesson and suddenly I'm back to normal but I feel motivated again and just generally more fulfilled. 

I really recommend that anyone going through a tough time picks up a language and uses it as a chance to get their head down and focus on something else with a greater goal in mind.

languagelearning,Travel can boost your language learning motivation,"
I went uk last year with my friends. He can’t speak English at all. I could speak English badly at that point. We are Japanese and age of 25 at that time. We stayed hostel for less spending money. Young Homeless of age around 30 lived that hostel. I had never seen real homeless until then. We hate him at first because of his appearance. When we were having dinner at kitchen in hostel, he talked us for giving him a food. We give him some meals and take conversations with him. He said that I have dream in becoming famous one day. Apparently he wanted to Hollywood star within three years. He said I’m doing hard work for it. We advised him that you can do it. He is appearing in movie not. He has achieved his dream. I don’t like staying English at that time. But from what he’s done, I feel that wherever you are, you can do whatever you want if you put energy into your dream.  Travel can make you better person

languagelearning,Discord servers for learning Japanese,"My thoughts. I don't expect you to agree with all my pros and cons, but I think you should give each server a try.

**Aka Japan** \- [https://discord.gg/VVHXHq3](https://discord.gg/VVHXHq3)

**Pros:** over 6k members, so it has many helpful people and lots of resources as well as friendly staff (from what I could tell). Serious Japanese studying happens here. Over 1 year old. Welcoming

**Cons:** not as active as I hoped when I joined last month. Lacking when it comes to channels.

**Overall:** Would be an awesome place if not for the lack of regular activity (I wasn't there for a long time, so you have to see for yourself). Seemed to value self-study more than group-study

**Japanese Language Study Space** \- [https://discord.gg/Ph2tZ3tRbq](https://discord.gg/Ph2tZ3tRbq)

**Pros:** also has helpful people, resources, and staff. Server is organized nicely. OK choice of channels (too many tbh). Serious Japanese studying happens here. Staff were very nice. Welcoming

**Cons:** under 1k members (may be a pro for you idk). Too many channels makes it hard to get around for the first day or two. Some of their events and voice chats aren't always about Japanese. Activity varies day to day. Took a while until I got used to the... different feel? Under 1 year old

**Overall:** somewhat new server, great for practicing! Voice chats are nice when they have people talking (JP Classroom's VCs are better in some ways). Values group-study over self-study

**JP Classroom** \- [https://discord.gg/mrYDaaX](https://discord.gg/mrYDaaX)

**Pros:** almost 20k members. Lots of knowledgeable people there. Nice layout and choice of channels. Older server (good imo). Very active. Lots of resources (more than the other two servers). Very serious about helping people learn. Welcoming

**Cons:** intimidating due to the sheer size (members) of it. A little too active at times. I didn't feel as welcome in VC like I did in the other servers.

**Overall:** a wonderful server to practice and study Japanese in! By far the most helpful server for beginners (Japanese Language Study Space is second. My opinion of course). Values group-study over self-study

languagelearning,"How is one to establish a strong foundation in a hard, dead language?","There seems to be the consensus that to gain proficiency in a language the learner should actively use the language—initially reading and listening—at a level that is just a step above their current ability. 
With this in mind, what is one to do when learning a dead language where there are no beginner texts? Texts that are extant in dead languages are usually texts that have been considered worthy of preservation—ones deemed to have high philosophical or literary value. In other words the texts are hard. 

Furthermore, texts are not usually from the same period, meaning that vocabulary and grammar differ from text to text, to varying degrees.

While there are lists of essential/beginners vocabulary and grammar, there are no texts which employ only these beginner elements in a consistent and accessible fashion. Usually they are mixed with more obscure and idiosyncratic elements, so it is hard to work one’s way through the text to consolidate a beginner knowledge; every sentence requires reference to a dictionary or modern translation/s. 

How is one to consolidate a strong beginner knowledge when faced with nothing but hard reading material?

languagelearning,Learned a language for a job I'm not going to do anymore,"Right before covid hit I was offered a volunteer position in Indonesia. To prepare, all throughout covid I've been taking classes learning Bahasa Indonesia and I actually got pretty good at it, thinking covid will end in less than a year or so and I'll know enough to be comfortable living and working in the country. I didn't expect to really fall in love with it -- it's such a cool language and its been incredibly fun to learn. I've learned Thai and Italian for school previously, but those languages didn't quite click the same way Indonesian does. It's really been my saving grace of quarantine, having someone to talk to and learning something so fun and new. 

But, with no potential for the border to open in sight, I've agreed to a full time job near my hometown and in my career field (conservation biology-- jobs like this are pretty rare). It came right at a time where my teacher and I decided to take a two week break, and on the day I signed my offer letter for this new job, my Indonesian teacher messaged me asking how I'm doing and to see if I wanted to meet for class earlier in the week than we had planned, which normally I'd be really keen on doing. I told him about my job offer and he was so excited for me and asked me if I wanted to keep going with lessons. 

We both decided it made the most sense to stop for now, between being busy with a new job and the border not opening any time soon.

I just feel so sad to have learned a language that I might not really get a chance to use for a while. I'm so glad that I learned it, and I'm glad I met my teacher who I feel has become a good friend. But I feel like theres this piece of my self I've just discovered that I don't know what to do with (Aside from watching Indonesian YouTube videos and listening to Indonesian songs).

languagelearning,When to know you've bitten off more than you can chew?,"TL;DR at bottom.

I'm a university student. I love languages, so I hope to major in two different languages. Let's call them Language A and Language B. They're both related languages, FYI. Think European/European or East Asian/East Asian. I know it's not advised to learn multiple languages at once, but I figured I was fine with being a little less fluent in both than only picking one to hone.

Anyway, this year has been extremely rough on me. I found solace in some YouTubers who speak Language A. They helped me through a lot. But as a result, I've been focusing more on Language A. And by that I mean, I was almost basically doing MIA (Mass Immersion Approach) because of how much time I spent watching/listening/reading/etc. things in Language A, thanks to these YouTubers. This year I excelled in my Language A class and essentially failed my Language B class. Today my language B teacher told me I probably won't be able to continue onto the next level and that I should just pick one language to learn.

I... just don't know what to do. I've been interested in both languages since I was eleven years old. I've based so much of my future on learning both of these languages. I don't want to believe that it may be time for me to give up on one of them. 

Last year I went through a similar thing with Language A. I failed a class and decided to quit. I went half a year before I returned. I begged my university to let me go back half a level to review and that really helped. But that's not an option with Language B, due to how the courses are structured. I do have the option to study really hard over the summer and ask to take a test to be let into the next level of Language B but... I'm not sure if I trust myself to study well enough. I have ADHD, which makes forcing myself to study exponentially harder. From my past experiences, I know I probably wouldn't do it. Or at least, I wouldn't do it well/often enough. 

I'm not entirely sure what I'm saying anymore. Basically, I'm just kind of at a loss. I've given up on so much in my life and I thought I finally found what I was going to do for the rest of my life. I don't want to have to give up again. But is it time? Should I? I'm not looking for reassurance. I just want to hear what people have to say on this topic. Anybody who wants to share their own experience with issues like this in the comments is welcome to.  

I may post this in multiple subreddits, so I'm sorry if you see it on your timeline more than once.

languagelearning,Should there be more emphasis on immersion in language learning?,"I only say this because my sister has a 3 year old child and I was thinking about he learns. It sounds dumb but he doesn't study or do memorization. In fact I think he only really understands maybe 30% of what we say, but he uses context clues and then attaches real life things to those words. Like he never was formally taught what ""big"" means but through watching he has.

I just think learning is far more complex than what we think. I guess I visualize the way we learn as a giant web where everything connect to each other, there is no centre or entry point, just a mess of lines. And book learning seems to be the opposite of that in the way it makes learning so rigid and formal.

This isnt a post shitting on book learning, it is 100% necessary as an adult who doesnt have unlimited money and can just move to a foreign country. But I just wonder if anyone else has similar thoughts. Do we not focus enough on immersion?",1617906387,Federer2020hype,25

languagelearning,What language should I learn? Spanish or Swedish or any suggestions?,"I've wanted to learn a second language for a while now, the only issue is I don't have a reason.  I wanted to learn Japanese and started to do so, then I realised my reason wasn't enough to motivate me anymore and in fact, I was scared that understanding Japanese would ruin my enjoyment of watching Subbed Anime (I like having to read subtitles and hearing audio instead of listening to words) - yes this may seem silly to you but it is what it is.  I 'learnt' Spanish for about 5years at school but with a weak teacher I never felt engaged so didn't pay attention and just had fun instead. Something I did learn when trying to learn Japanese was I don't think I want to learn an East-Asian language, I appreciate and respect the culture but don't like it enough to fully embrace myself into it (something I imagine learning a language would require); that cancels out quite a few languages and gives reasons to do so. I'd like the language to be able to benefit me in regards to my career (most likely finance related or management; studying Economics at University so there's a range of careers I could go into if I change my mind). I currently live in London and can only speak English, I like the idea of living abroad as living in London has made me less fond of it in recent years but I'm not entirely sure I can call such a move at this moment in my life so I don't feel comfortable learning a language now in preparation for moving there in the future. With this in consideration, I have come down to either learning Spanish (I have past experience and it's widely spoken, I'd likely benefit in my career from speaking it) or Swedish (Swedish girls are fit, I can imagine myself living in a Scandanavian country and according to Google its one of the best Scandanavian languages to learn - plus I like Vikings).

My question for you is which one would you recommend choosing and do you think learning Swedish would benefit me with better career opportunities?

languagelearning,Talking with language exchange partner at A1/A2,"I'm looking for some tips here and hoping for some creativity. 

Last year, I started learning Russian (TL3) and I'm loving it. My first two languages I learned by living and working in countries where it was spoken as a native language so I **had** to learn, yet rarely studied. I had practical experience and it really worked well with my personal learning style. 

Now with Russian, I am back in the US and I don't really have any push or need to learn, but that's okay. I am taking it at a slow pace and just enjoying the journey. I have a tandem partner who I speak with 1-2x/week and it's really nice to at least have some regular, authentic contact with the language. 

That said, it always feels just a bit awkward. She's really nice and an intermediate-level English speaker, but we don't have a lot of common interests, so the conversation always needs a push. When we speak Russian, it's hard because I'm not really at a level where I can produce a lot, nor am I much outside basic, to-the-point comments. She's not very good at speaking slowly and clearly, nor at sticking to level-appropriate topics so I usually use the time to ask questions I have with the language and/or to read short texts together. I like this, but I feel like my time could be used in a better way. 

Any tips or ideas of what I can do to spice up this tandem relationship? 😂 Thanks in advance!",1617897612,youcool_man,0

My university offers language programs and I have narrowed down to Dutch and Polish. I plan on learning both languages eventually as I live in the Netherlands and my girlfriend is Polish. So it's not a matter of which language, but which language right now. 

My main question is which would be better to learn in a university environment? I am a native English speaker so I know Dutch would be ""easier"" and given that I already live in the country, formal classes alongside daily life would help my progress a lot.

Polish is much more demanding grammar wise as I've already dabbled a bit with my girlfriend. But maybe that grammar would stick better with a teacher instead of my girlfriend. Plus I can always practice with her in the afternoons.

languagelearning,I can roll my Rs except when casually speaking!,"Bare with me. I've been practicing to roll Rs for years now. I used to believe I was one of those people who ""medically"" or naturally just couldn't roll their Rs. But as I've practiced and practiced for a long time I was able to finally learn it. I went from what I call a ""fake R rolling"" which is like how you pronounce the ""t"" in ""butter"", to actually being able to make that long ""rrrr"" sound. 

(I'm not saying the ""fake R rolling"" is actually fake! That's just how I call it because only being able to do that won't do much when speaking a language like let's say Spanish! I know the light R sound is often pronounced but still isn't the actual RRRRRolling)

So anyway, I know how to roll my Rs now. I can do the ""rrrrrr"" when speaking. But the problem is when it comes to actual conversations, weirdly enough, I struggle to do them?!!! Like, I legit can't do them in a casual ideal conversations with real people.

And then I discovered that whenever I said I effectively ""rolled"" my Rs, I realized that I actually use quite a bit of air to do it. I need to exert energy, effort, just to roll my Rs. Plus my rolling Rs, although sound good, sound a bit more airy than they should be. 

There's no space for that in a casual conversation. In a casual conversation you don't focus on making your breath flow in a way that when you go for the ""r"" it's gonna rrrroll. 

In a casual conversation I just talk, clear voice, no airiness. So I guess that's why I struggle. Whenever I try do it in a casual convo, I end up just making a hard ""t"" sound. I hate it!

How can people roll their Rs casually like it's just an F or an S? I've done many exercises -- sentences that consisted of Rs in different places of different words after &amp; before different letters. 

And it isn't consistent. I can mostly do the rolling R with words that start with R. But it's almost impossible for me to do them right after an S. For example ""las rocas."" I can say rrrocas, but I struggle to say ""las rrrocas"" casually. 

The tongue position changing is extremely difficult! Like how do an R instantly after an S?

So that's my problem. And it's really ironic since I'm Filipino and in my native language Tagalog, we roll our Rs quite a lot. I've been searching for people with the same problem as me online, but all I can find are either people who can roll their Rs, or people who completely just can't. To me it's not that simple. I can, but I've still got problems. How do you move from this weird place of being able to do it but not really, to actually being able to do it like a Spanish native?",1617878455,nikkomercado,8

languagelearning,Cheaper Alternatives To Michel Thomas Method?,"Hi all,

I've experimented with language learning before and the only method that engages me is the Michel Thomas approach. For those of you who don't know, his method tends to focus on being taught *why* a sentence makes sense and how it links to your base language. You start off finding words very similar to English, then build that into a phrase and then very quickly shown ways to pick up pieces of a phrase and use them in multiple different scenarios and you really feel you are understanding the language rather than memorising it. I picked up Spanish pretty quickly this way.

Any method of teaching that just involves repeating endless phrases that only make sense in a certain situation I get no benefit from and brings back nightmares of being back at school.

The only problem with Michel Thomas is its pretty expensive for just dipping your toe into something new and then building up the course. Are there any cheaper ways to learn a language more aligned with the style of teaching I like?

My fiancee is British Indian and I really want to learn Hindi so I can speak with her family more.

languagelearning,I dont know if I should learn Mandarin Chinese or Japanese,"I am German, so the only languages I know are German and English.

I want to learn either Mandarin or Japanese.

First of all I would like to say that I dont expect any business opportunities from any of those languages, I am happy with my profession and thats not really why I want to learn a new language, I want to learn a new language because I like the country, people, culture and the sound of the language.

Now I find both languages EXTREMELY interesting, having to learn a new writing system is actually not a negative but a positive aspect for me because its extremely interesting to me.

However, I simply cant decide between Mandarin or Japanese.

To me, japanese simply sounds better, at least in my uneducated, foreign opinion.
Chinese, to me, sometimes or often, sounds like people are shouting at you, and I think this is the case because its a tonal language. Japanese on the other hand sounds calm to me, poetic, more focused. Idk how to describe it. I would even say more sexy/attractive.

So, from an acoustic point of view, japanese wins for me perspnally.

However, a downside of japanese is that, well, outside of Japan, I dont think you profit at all of knowing the language. I believe even in my country (Austria) I have met way more chinese people than japanese people. Since chinese is a world language and vastly more spoken than japanese, this point goes to Chinese.

Another point that stops me from learning Japanese atm is the Writing system. It uses Kanji, Kana and Romaji at the same time and to me, thats insanely intimidating. Idk if its really that hard or much harder than chinese, maybe someone has experience or can elaborate a bit, since thats my main concern tbh.

In chinese however, the 4 tones is whats giving me doubts. Its just such a huge plus for Japanese that it doesnt have these tones. I dont know how hard the Chinese tones are to pronounce, but the fact that a word can mean 4 different things just because you pronounce it a little little bit different, definitely gives me doubts whether or not I could get used to that, since I have zero experience with tonal languages.

So my positive/ negative list:

Chinese +

1) World Language, therefore more likely to meet people across the world who speak this language

2) Much simpler Grammar

3) Only one writing system (not 3 like it is in Japan)

Chinese -

1) Much harder pronounciation due to the 4 tones

2) To me, it doesnt sound as good as japanese, because of the reasons I stated above


Japanese +

1) Much easier pronounciation 

2) To me it just sounds better, more calm, more poetic, not so “shouting” if you know what I mean

3) I could play my favorite games, Nioh, Sekiro, and Ghost of Tsushima in original language.

Japanese -

1) Much harder grammar

2) 3 writing systems, therefore I assume much more complicated and a deeper learning curve?

3) Not a world language, outside of Japan its not really likely I will ever really profit from knowing that language (I do not watch Animes so thats not a factor for me)

So now I would like your personal opinions and maybe you can elaborate a bit on some things I said, you can also correct me if Im wrong. What language would you prefer to learn?",1617872521,AlarmRep,19

languagelearning,I’m struggling to assess what reading level I’m at.,"I’m a big reader, and I’m trying to find books that are a challenge, but still comprehensible.  

My problem is this, in the book I’m in now I can go 5-7 pages and understand it perfectly. Really feel in the zone you know? But then, I’ll hit a wall (maybe the subject changes or I’m not in the right headspace) and its like I’ve forgotten everything about Italian.  I don’t understand a single thing.  So...I think my understanding is so situational based that finding a topic where  I understand the majority (but not all) is quite difficult.  

Also, I’ve heard you should be able to understand 70 percent of your input.  I actually find this harder to quantify than it sounds. So that’s understanding most of it right? Like, I can summarize the key ideas but I can’t translate every word.  Is that the goal here?

Also, I’m moving onto reading material for native adults.  Should I assume all of that is b2 or above? C1? What do you think? 

Thanks for any advice!",1617840637,ButterscotchOk8112,5

languagelearning,Frustration taught me that I CAN learn a language,"I wanted to share my story on how frustration got me to where I am today. I'm from the UK and if you don't already know, the way they teach languages in schools is pretty terrible and I was clueless. I kept taking class after class, school after school and I still couldn't speak Spanish. I spent 7 years trying but I was still at beginner level, I had given up at that point thinking that I just wasn't the kind of person that could learn languages. 

Then I started my first job after university, one of my colleagues was Spanish and I was like ""oh cool! I took Spanish classes in school, I love Spanish"". I remember speaking with more colleagues over the months about languages, as the majority of my team are from around the world, they can all speak another language, one of them was shocked to hear that I could only speak English. I responded with the ""oh yeah well schools here are terrible, most British people don't speak another language"". 

This all got me frustrated, the school system, my past failures, how almost everyone around me was bilingual. So I started Spanish again, but this time by myself. I was determined to tackle this, I couldn't live my whole life annoyed that I'm monolingual and blaming it on other things.

It took me a few months to figure out what methods worked for me and how to actually learn. I took some iTalki classes to practice my speaking, so nervous I had to have a little bit of alcohol before my first class to ease my worries. After some classes I was still nervous but I wanted to try speaking with my colleague. I went to work the next day, thinking all day about saying any Spanish word to him but I just couldn't! I went home so disappointed with myself. It wasn't until frustration hit again the next day that I managed to say something ""Yesterday, I will have conversation class, it is good!"" I didn't realise I used the wrong tense until months later when I thought back on this moment. I can't even remember how he replied, just that I was so nervous to speak, I probably said ""estoy nerviosa"" plenty of times. It still didn't feel like much of a win.

Okay, I will get better at speaking and we can have some proper conversations! A few months later I try again, we talk about our day and how we are, some small talk and I'm feeling accomplished. However, he can't stop laughing and I can't tell if he's laughing at my terrible Spanish or what, I pester him to tell me ""why are you laughing"" but he just replies ""no no it's okay"" so I leave it for the day feeling that my Spanish still isn't good enough, I'm still frustrated so I keep studying. (I later found out he was laughing because it's weird to hear me suddenly speak Spanish when he associates me with English speaking only, do you have this with your friends?) 

At a new years eve party I met some more Spanish people and I tell them I'm learning Spanish so they all look at me and say ""say something!"" I'm so red and I mess up, I felt like a total beginner again. I told them ""next year we can have a proper conversation!"" So I've already set expectations to keep me studying. (Except covid happened so we haven't seen each other). 

I would also get frustrated about how often I would repeated the phrases ""it's bad"", ""it's good"", ""it's important that.."". This forced myself to learn and think of other more interesting words to use in conversations.

Here we are about 1.5yrs later into my studying. I would say I'm in the middle of intermediate stage but it's foggy at this point. I'm happy to have passed that beginner stage I was stuck at for so long. That Spanish colleague I mentioned before is now one of my closest friends and we message each other a lot in Spanish, I look forward to practicing my speaking with him when we go back to the office.

Every failure brings me frustration but I let it fuel me instead of drag me down. Language learning can be frustrating, when someone speaks too fast, when you speak well one day but not the next, when you forget seemingly easy words, when you feel setbacks or you've reached the intermediate plateau. 

I'm happy that now I'm at this point where I can read native Spanish books, watch shows and have conversations (that aren't just small talk). Frustration has taught me that I CAN learn a language.",1617834045,Sheppy_Speaks,47

NL: ""Can you call him for me?""
TL1: ""Pode chamá-lo para mim?""
TL2: ""Pouvez-vous l'appeler pour moi?""

I've recently got myself a tutor, before i was taking weekly lessons in a class. We'd follow a structure that focused a lot on topics like health, food, directions, shopping etc and we did do present tense and towards the end (before the pandemic) started some imperfect tense too. 

Now with my tutor i've been interested in learning more grammar as i feel it will help me to construct sentences and start practicing my speaking more. My tutor is adhering to what i want and is supporting me to do so! Unfortunately, my brain feels like it's confusing a lot of the rules with other rules and is struggling to make sense of it all. We have been doing imperfect, passé composé (eurgh) and we did some conditionell. 

My main issue is recalling the conjugation for être and avoir to help with making the other tenses, the rules for the tenses (which auxiliary to use, imperfect and its use with Passé composé, past participle and present participle) . It's all just turning into a jumbled mess in my head and I feel like without a decent grasp on english grammar too (I just speak it!) and identifying what tense i'm using it's hard to make sense of it all.

languagelearning,Essay no one asked for: Your post sucks. Here's what to do about it.,"Damn, one day maybe I'll have to figure out a different name to call this ""series"" instead of just ""essay no one asked for""... That's for future me. Anyway:

Your post sucks. Yeah, you. You who posts ""what language should I learn,"" posts, or ""is this dialect or this dialect more useful,"" posts- your post sucks. Here's why. 

**Part I: Types of posts that suck**

So first off, let's define which posts truly suck. I split them, generally, into a few broad categories. 

First, *""What language should I learn?""* Which, for my purposes in this essay, will be defined differently than the kinds of posts mentioned in the sub rules. I'll further elaborate in a moment. 

Second, *""Why x language is hard.""* Oh, honey, it's almost as if all languages are hard to some degree or another. 

Third, a much more broad category, since these types of posts all seem vaguely the same to me. *""Is it too late for x?"", ""How do I do x?"",* and  *""Can I still learn if x?""*  type posts. Now, let's get started.

**Part II: Which language should I learn?** 

I don't think anyone truly understands the amount of these posts there are, even with it being encoded in the subreddit rules. For my purposes, I define this class of sucky post as anything that encompasses

a. Which dialect to learn

and b. Which language in general.

So first off, let's talk about dialects. Very broadly dialects are regional collections of colloquialisms within any given language. Think high-German versus alpine-German. Most language learners know of a couple of regional dialects within their TL, unless the language is internationally standardized (very unlikely). It is fully respectable to post asking about specific dialects, however, what makes your post suck, is asking which dialect is most *useful*. 

Let me be clear here, almost everything in learning a language depends on your goals. If your goal is only to visit China for a week, elementary Mandarin with minimal grammar would be perfect for you. This applies to dialects as well. Before you post, ask yourself, what are my goals? The difference between learning standardized language and colloquialisms is entirely dependent upon what you want to do with that language- if you want to live in Quebec, learning Canadian French should be your goal. If you want to live in Haiti, Haitian French and Creole should be your goal. And truly, if you have zero goals in your language- not even fun or fascination- you should be asking why you continue learning anyway. Almost every one of these dialectical posts can be solved by a simple question- what are my goals in this language/culture?

Moving on, this category can also be broken into its barest bones with general ""what language should I learn"" questions. I'll admit, I am not innocent in this. In an old Reddit account of mine which I've since deleted, my young starry-eyed self spammed this kind of post- normally just to flex my knowledge of other languages. I believe these posts are best broken down into subcategories based on intention. If you're only posting to flex knowledge like I did (I know seven languages, how can I learn eight?) then reconsider. I'm sorry for being rude, sir, but your post sucks. If your intention is to genuinely ask, the answer can be given to you before even hitting the post button. What language you should learn is entirely dependent upon *your goals.* There's that g-word again- your goals completely determine this. If you start out the language learning process with zero goals in mind, no passion for the language or culture, no vague interest in the country/culture/language/people, and not even a short-term goal like ""get an A in Spanish class,"" you're not going to make it far. Language learning takes *years* despite what YouTube polyglots will tell you, so you need to at least like the language a bit before diving in.

That's why everyone on this sub just replies ""Uzbek"" and leaves it at that. You're asking a dumb question, and I'm sorry, but your post sucks.

**Part III: Why x language is hard**

Okay dude, we get it, you get frustrated with your TL sometimes, we all do, it's natural! But please, do not come on here expecting to get sympathy for something as trivial as *synonyms*. Every language is hard to learn, every language takes time. But what I hate probably the most in this sub is people posting memes talking about how ""though, through, and thought's ough sounds are all pronounced different! English is terrible!"" Yeah, sometimes it's humorous. But it trivializes the language learning process. That is by far not the hardest thing about English- in fact, I wouldn't say there is any hardest part of any language. It's called the language acquisition process because it is a *process*. It takes time and effort, and trivializing the process by posting these ""Why x language is hard"" memes disheartens some people- I know it did me when I was first starting out in French. It is perfectly fine to vent your frustrations with your TL- we have all been through it, but you can't break down centuries of history that lead up to the creation of this language and what makes it so hard with ""German has long words, therefore very very difficult, stay away."" It's not constructive, it adds nothing to the conversation, and I'm sorry, but your post sucks.

**Part IV: Is it too late for love? (Is it??)** 

My final broad sucky post category is ""is it too late"" posts. To put it simply, no. It is not too late to learn Hungarian. It's not too late to learn Japanese- it's never too late to learn. Frankly, I don't care about your personal circumstances- whether you're 12 or 78- my answer is the same. There is no wrong time to learn a language, no matter who you are. Don't listen to the internet pulling you down saying you can never reach native fluency if you start late in life- they only say that because they gave up and want to feel better. That's all it is. 

Honestly, this post category doesn't suck to me or annoy me as much as it makes me sad. We as internet culture have worn down starry-eyed souls that are eager to learn by constantly telling them baselessly that they have missed their only chance to accomplish their goal. Languages are a lifelong process and you will be learning forever, but that doesn't mean you will *never* reach native level like the internet trolls say. Most natives are still learning their language! Hell, last year I would've had to google the meaning of ephemeral or serendipity and that's my own damn mother tongue! 

This kind of post doesn't suck because it's a dumb question. It sucks because I and everyone else sitting in complacency on the great world-wide web have allowed you to continue believing it. And I regret that immensely. So yeah, that post sucks. Because we've let it happen.

**Part V: Most posts don't suck**

Look, I like this sub. I like most of the posts and I love learning about other cultures and talking to fellow learners. But posts like these boil my blood sometimes. And if I have to be raised on a Reddit pike for calling it out, so be it.

Let's review. Your goals are all that matter learning your language, and no one can tell you how or why to do it. And also, don't listen to the internet trolls. This sub can be filled with nothing but success stories, positive affirmation, learning resources, and good times, but first, we all- me included- have to stop sucking.

If you made it to the end, good job! Have a cookie {Insert cookie here}. Having written this instead of my English lit essays, I bid you adieu, and am curious to hear your thoughts. Vive les linguiphiles. Goodnight.

languagelearning,Sign Language Culture,"My girlfriend is learning american sign language. I personally do not know ASL although the things she tells me about the culture confuse me. I feel it's important to note she is not deaf and picked up ASL in college.

Anyways she frequently discusses how inclusive the culture is and it kind of confuses me. She does not want to teach sign language as she sees it taboo for her, a not deaf person, to teach it when the opportunity should go to someone who is deaf. She is also against lip reading and getting hearing aids for deaf people unless they specifically request it.

She considers herself an outsider to the deaf community and wants it to be that way. She says there is for the most part a kind of private club socially for people who are deaf, and then this group of deaf people will sometimes socialize with people who speak ASL. It may have been just how she worded it to me but it seemed like a very unforgiving community. She is interested in going to the deaf college in washington DC, but is unsure if she should since she can hear.

I understand deaf people have been portrayed as basically mentally challenged for most of history, and so she says they are permitted to exclude themselves from people who can hear because of that. Are the things she has described to me typically what sign language culture is like? I may be misunderstanding her",1617752610,PenguinBond,0

languagelearning,I really want to learn Spanish but I need advice first,"Hello.

I've been trying to learn Spanish on and off for a few years now but I'm back and I have some urge to come and learn it again. I don't know what it is about the language but it's just fascinated me. Ever since I've visited Spain as a kid it gives me a load of nostalgia that I want to feel continuously. The language sounds so soft and sophisticated (European version.)

The music, scenery, weather, people, radio, TV.. everything about it is so interesting. What doesn't motivate me about the language is a great deal of people know English and that number is growing because they have so many English tourists. If they know English then what's the point in learning their language? Another thing is there are so many different variations of the language that I don't like that much. When learning it there is going to be a variety of resources that feature Mexican Spanish for example and I detest the way it sounds.

Now to the music. I recently discovered what I believe is called Raggaeton from listening to Spanish radio.  I adore a lot of the music and it's really hard to keep up with all the new releases when you religiously listen to other genres. It's **really** annoying when you can't understand the words because they sound so beautiful. If anyone else is into the music maybe you could try and recommend some based on this song that I'm digging at the moment called '*Location*' by Karol G.

I am studying for exams at the same time but I could try and fit it in by doing little bits everyday. I'm in no rush but I would like to get to a point where I can read an article in Spanish at sometime. Some interesting facts about the language would be great.

And finally the most important question, what would be the best way to learn Spanish? What good resources are there that aren't some YouTube series as they didn't work so well for me. I like Duolingo but I've been told that it isn't the best. Could someone advise me the best way (for free preferably) and  maybe someone who has been in the same boat as me could share their story?

Still to this day, (25M) I don't intend to be 100% inherently British pitch perfect, even while living in the UK, because it's an accent that if you don't get 100% natural and right, it sounds incredibly cringy to me. I don't feel the same way about people who speak my native language at that level, I don't cringe when I try to improve or tune my pronunciation in Italian/Spanish/French.

Is it because I don't have the inherent exposure growing up in those languages to know that Italians or Spaniards would cringe at someone trying to hit their accent perfectly? Or is English a specific case that people prefer to listen to someone with an accent than someone mimicking a pretentious accent and sounding off? It's become so internationalised that ""international English"" has become commonplace and easy on the ear that hitting a BBC RP English is nothing to strive for anymore. Maybe this happens in tonal languages, Danish, French? Where accents are very specific?

The main benefit of Lingq it seems is to keep a track of how many words you’re learning. However I currently also use Readlang to read ebooks and know that doing so will give the repetition needed to turn those Lingqs to a different colour (even if I can see them doing so).

I am learning to read Urdu and one of the things I struggle with is that the letter forms in Nastaliq are completely different than they are when viewed on (say) an alphabet sheet that shows media final initial forms in non Nastaliq scripts.

languagelearning,What is a language?," What is a language? Perhaps, this is a question we don’t ask ourselves or other people very often. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, a language is “a system of conventional spoken, manual (signed), or written symbols by means of which human beings, as members of a social group and participants in its culture, express themselves. The functions of language include communication, the expression of identity, play, imaginative expression, and emotional release.”

We can say then that a language is a medium, and more specifically a medium of communication. As the Latin origin of the word “medium” indicates, a “medium” is something that stands in the middle. So, for communication to exist, at least two participants are needed. Moreover, they both have to know the same medium of communication, accept its rules and use it the same way. 

It is said that a language can reveal much about someone’s identity, origin, characteristics, social rank, level of education, psychology. What do you think? What is your view about languages? What are your experiences in the universe of languages?",1617683882,languagesworld,1

languagelearning,Japanese / beginner," So I've been wanting to learn Japanese for a while. I talk Polish (my mother language), English, and Norwegian (fluent). Because Norway got a second lockdown now and I don't have a job, I decided to spend my free time learning Japanese finally. The problem I have is that I don't know where I should start and which sites/books I should choose. 

I read that Hiragana is the first thing I should learn, however, I'm not sure so I rather ask you guys.

Could you tell me guys; 

In what order I should learn Japanese?

Which learning methods are the best?

What websites/books to learn Japanese can you recommend?",1617676352,OkAd1345,4
languagelearning,A strong accent and Among us,"Since I accidentally disabled [child account] the free chat in among us, I started playing via voicechat on dc. The main language there is english and while I consider my written english to be ok or even good, my spoken english isn't that good because I lack training (no real lessons due to covid, not speaking too much in lessons in general). I can understand the others 100% and I can respond to everything, which is, at least imo, pretty great because this game and the meetings are a mess haha.

Often, when I'm talking, I get asked if I'm German and if I say yes (i am German) ppl say that I have a thick German accent.  While this is nothing too bad because I'm still learning (english lessons in school (7,5yrs) and actively consuming English content (~2-3 years), never really speaking outside the lessons) and improving, I still feel kinda.. unmotivated to continue because I don't want ppl to know where I'm from by listening to me saying 2 sentences [Sometimes the other ppl are germans too but I don't hear an accent from them and sometimes they are natives] and because many say that the german accent is ugly :c

Ik it seems so minor but I'm kinda scared to talk in the vc lobbies because ppl might judge my accent &gt;&lt;",1617672453,J-Horsi,5
languagelearning,Am I making the right decision? Learning Japanese trough English vs Hungarian,"Hey everyone, I am a Native hungarian speaker, but I also know a lot of english. My speaking and writing might not be as good as I want it to be, but listening and reading wise I can understand almost anything.

I deciced to learn Japanese trough english, simply because the resources are 1000x more common, and I do not really like to consume anything in hungarian. 
I don’t think that english will handicap me at all. I learned chinese before switching to Japanese, I was learning that trough english and I was doing shockingly well. So I don’t see why english would be a handicap, unless the more I know in Japanese the harder it will become english wise too.

I am only contemplating my choices, because I read on a few sites that Hungarian and Japanese share some similarities, tho I don’t know to what extend those similarities help actually. Finally it’s also my native language.

I pretty much decided already, but I am just confirming if I am making the right choice.

TL;DR: I will probably be learning Japanese trough English. (Around C1), not Hungarian (my Native), because I enjoy it more, and there are far more resources in English. Just confirming if I am making the right choice.

Thanks for the answers in advance",1617671538,the-weird-guy-69,5

languagelearning,Any teenagers here learning languages as a hobby?,"Hello, my name is Noah, I'm 15 years old and I live in Austria. I really love language learning. I can speak 4 languages nowadays with confidence and I started a new one 2 months ago. I am here to ask if there is anyone else with a similar age who also enjoys language learning, because I don't know many who do and all my friends and classmates think that language learning is some kind of witchcraft that is impossible.

For those who are interested in my language learning career: I learnt English as my first foreign language in school, but at that time, I didn't think that language learning was interesting for me (Learning a language at school isn't a very good way and not very enjoyable, lets face it). That changed however when I was 13, where I started using Duolingo out of interest. I used it for like 3 months to improve my English, then as that app pleased me more and more, I started learning French with it and sticked with it for a year or so (Today I know that that was a bit too much and I don't use Duolingo anymore since it isn't very effective.) Nowadays, I watch french YouTube videos and I can understand most of it.

When I was 14, I decided that I wanted to move on to another language. I thought that since my parents speak both Serbocroatian, that that was the next language I wanted to tackle on. I could speak it a little bit at that time, maybe an A2 level but with many mistakes. So I bought myself a book (Assimil, which I think is a great ressource). It was very different from my french learning-process. French on Duolingo was always pretty easy, however, learning with Assimil is in the beginning very tough and you really gotta pay attention to how the language actually works. However, the more I learnt with it, the more comfortable I got and nowadays I don't make many mistakes anymore.

Some months ago, I decided that I wanted to learn Latin, because I was always interested in learning it. When I was a child, I always imagined how cool it would be if I could speak the same language as the Romans did. So I bought myself a new Assimil book and started learning with it. It is still difficult, but I think that in 6-12 months I will have acquired enough confidence in it to speak it freely. (I'm purposely not saying ""I will have mastered it"" because I know that that will be a much longer path to go.)

So again, is there any teenager who also loves language learning as I do? If so, please let me know and tell me your story.",1617631094,Noahgamerrr,91

1.In general how long does it take  to be fluent in mandarin vs japanese ?

languagelearning,"I think I know why I'm getting tripped up in language learning, but I don't know where to go from here.","I'm acclimated to a classroom approach to learning. It's formulaic, read this watch that, test here, next unit. I like the approach because I know exactly what to do and you just add building blocks to it bit by bit and before you know it, boom now I have a rudimentary understanding of statistics. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's not how language learning works.  Language isn't so linear. There is no Unit 1 because it's so multifaceted. Think about it, if you check out at a grocery store, you need to have the necessary vocabulary, syntax, grammar, pronunciation, etc. ready to go. How do we learn it though?

&amp;#x200B;

I wish there was a way to layout a curriculum with language learning but even if we made one, as many have attempted, that's not how we learn language because with the classroom format if you learn one lesson and test on it, what happens next? You forget it and make room for the next set of lessons. 

&amp;#x200B;

I actually briefly studied language in my psychology class ( I'm not a psychologist and it's just an AP class so please don't roast me for my ignorance) and that's when I found out... you can forget your native language! I have to assume that my textbook's claim was a bit overstated and it has to vary in degree on a person-to-person level but that's what led to my epiphany. 

&amp;#x200B;

we've all heard the saying ""your body is only as fit as it needs to be"" or more commonly "" use it or lose it."" We learned our native languages by constant exposure to them from every imaginable facet of it.  At school, work, home, on tv, in books, the signs are written in our native languages, our music is sung in them, etc. That's how we learned them. That doesn't fit the classroom format I've become accustomed to though. What do I do? I can't afford to drop in another country for seven years. I'm stuck in America where the majority of people know about .8 languages (we're still figuring out English) and I can't leave. How would I reasonably simulate this experience?  Is there a classroom format I could follow to at least ""get my sea legs""?

I moved from India to America when I was about 6 and so I have a Americanized accent and my understanding of Hindi is weak, but still there somewhat. My parents never stopped speaking Hindi at home and so I think that helped me maintain a bit of an understanding, but it is mostly conversational and I barely know any nouns. I can understand much much better than I can speak, and I can't read it at all. I know Hindi isn't as common of a language to learn as others so I understand if you cannot give me specific advice about that, just looking for a point in the right direction.

My question is where do I start? Do I start from the absolute basics where someone with no knowledge would begin? I asked my mom and she told me to watch Indian movies, shows, other media etc. Another concern of mine is where do I introduce learning the Hindi alphabet? Should that be done as early as possible or should I wait until I have a more comfortable understanding with the language verbally?

I'm learning Korean. I'm also in my early teens. I've heard that, while not THE perfect time, the teens, bar age 18, are a great time to learn language, and the natural ability to do so declines greatly after that age. Korean is my top priority. It's been a goal of mine for a very long time.

The problem here is that I enjoy dabbling in other languages too. I'm sure I'll end up wanting to learn another. (Not to the same level but aspiring to be as fluent as possible is generally the baseline, right?) Mandarin seems fun af. Japanese culture and media is epic even though the language is just as hard as the culture that uses it is interesting. Thai is great too.

Any ideas on how to distribute my time? I obviously know that I'm going to be investing myself in Korean the most, but if there's anything I can do to take advantage of that superior ability while I have it and give my future self an easier time, I'd love to hear it.

languagelearning,Which language is actually the hardest to learn?," 

We all know the common answers to this question: Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, etc. However, these lists only consider a select few languages out of the 7,000 that exist.

Today, I'd like to ask for input from each of you. Let's assume we're talking about a native English speaker. Additionally, let's not consider available study material and other learning resources. Instead, I'd like to just focus on linguistic difficulty.

Here are some of my top choices:

Xoo(Taa) - Botswana and Namibia The most unique sounds of any language known within the linguistic community(130 or more), 20+ clicks, and 4 different tones. And like all the other languages I'll list, Xoo is not a member of the Indo-European language family, so it's vocabulary would be quite distinct.

Tundra Nenets - Russia As far as I know, this language has the most moods of any in the world(16). Additionally, it uses the Cyrillic alphabet, and additional challenge for English speakers.

Navajo - USA Navajo has a strong combination of difficult features. The language shows both agglutinative and fusional features(just like English), has 3 forms for stop consonants(creating lots of new sounds), 2 tones, and 7 grammatical moods.

Greenlandic - Greenland A polysinthetic language(one word can be an entire sentence), greenlandic would be quite the challenge. Plus, it has lots of fun velar and uvular consonants.

Guugu Ymithirr -Australia An indigenous language famous for using cardinal directions instead of an egocentric directional system. So you're standing ""east of me"", not ""in front"".

Cantonese Although I've been critical of well-known languages getting all the attention, the Chinese writing system is possibly the hardest in the world to learn. Cantonese has more tones than Mandarin(6 v. 4), so I chose it.

So what do you think? Which language is hardest, and why?

languagelearning,Creating an Omegle-type app for language learning,"Hiya, I'm thinking to try to build a random chat app for language learners, and wanted to see if there was much interest in this/get some feedback. (see below for an app mockup, will be working on a prototype next if all goes well!)

Some key things about this potential app, and that differ it from the existing language chat apps:

* Like Omegle, **you are paired randomly with another person**. No searching profiles for people to chat with. In fact, there are no public profiles to browse. 
   * You just set your native language(s), and which language you want to practice. So, an English native speaker learning Spanish, gets matched up with a Spanish native speaker learning English. The app then divides the time between each language, e.g. first minute it says speak Spanish only, second minute it tells you to speak English only. Since the convo is time-limited, and purely anonymous (no live video, or profile pictures), it's easy for you to end the chat if you don't vibe with the person, or if your partner is only using one language, etc., and not feel bad about it or feel pressured to keep talking. There's a few additional methods I've thought of to encourage and enforce the equal language exchange, since I know this is a problem for these kind of apps :)
   * I also thought of just having the chats be in one single language, but I think there's less incentive for native speakers speaking their own native language only.
* But, unlike Omegle, it would be **audio-only**. No video. No text chat (initially, at least- improving **speaking skills** is my goal!).
   * For one, I think this really helps with women's experience on these apps. Too many people use the existing chat apps for dating, unwanted sexual comments, etc., which is super discouraging to female users especially and detracts from the main focus of trying to practice a language. Additionally, video can be a bit of distraction (even when talking in your own native language!)- audio allows you to focus all your attention on your conversation.
* Focus on **short conversations**. Speaking in another language can be super intimidating, and even more so when it's so open-ended. This app would be a quick, simple way to get in \*consistent\* speaking practice.
   * The chat has a time limit- maybe, 1 minute, or even shorter. What if you're having a great conversation, you're really clicking with your partner, and want to keep going? No problem! Near the end of the time limit, the user can tap a button if they wish to continue the conversation. If \*both\* users press it, it'll extend the time and the chat will continue uninterrupted, until the chat is ended by one of the users, or the time runs out and the users didn't both tap the button to continue.
* **Conversation topics**. I know a big hurdle for me is, what the heck am I supposed to talk about??!?!  (especially after the usual, generic self-introductions)
   * The topics will be relevant to what your level is- beginner prompts could include family, weather, hobbies, while more advanced learners could get suggested to talk about recent events, philosophical questions, etc.

Here's a mockup I threw together of how things could look during a chat- second screen shows the time about to run out and the user being asked if they'd like to continue the chat.

languagelearning,Self learning Mandarin (or with a tutor),"Hi, I’ve been trying to learn Mandarin at least three times in my life. The amount of knowledge seems so overwhelming. I haven’t learned foreign language for at least 7 years now, I liked learning English in the past (although it was mostly cramming, grammar exercises and a lot of writing). I’d like to get the ball rolling with Chinese though being 26 yo and starting language from scratch seems like a waste of time a bit too. The first time I was exposed to English was in kindergarten. We probably sang a lot of silly songs - I am definitely not going to do that right now. Apart from vocabulary base, I’ll need proper pronunciation - I even heard that minor mispronunciations makes you incomprehensible in the eyes of the Chinese. Devoting five years to get basic fluency seems like a lot of effort with low reward - and there is a risk of not being understood at all.

I don’t have strong reasons on why I want to learn Chinese. I just feel I’d want to. Also, I am considering joining language school or hiring a tutor. That’s a major financial undertaking but it might be worth it. I am unsure if I’ll be able to persist with learning on my own.

Enough this rambling, I really hope someone will share their experiences. Have you learned Mandarin on your own? Maybe you indeed started with a tutor? Thanks for sharing.",1617471700,Silver-Thing,9

languagelearning,"Let's be real, most of us can only learn ONE language to C1 and then we'll be quitting this language learning game forever.","Learning a language to fluency is very rare. You can survey the users here and ask who has actually learnt a language to C2 fluency. I don't know the actual number, but from those users who have flairs set up, I can say I rarely see C2 in any languages. How about C1? I see those sometimes, but keep in mind self assessed levels tend to be inflated, what people say is C1 could actually be B2. True C1 is still rare.

If it's so hard just to learn ONE language to C1, I think it is safe to conclude we can forget about learning MULTIPLE languages to advanced level. 

Statistics don't lie. You can be an exception to the rule, but most likely, like 90% likely, you're going to learn one language to C1, and then having maxed out your brain power, you'll quit this hobby forever. 

So what does this mean? When choosing which languages to learn, tell yourself you can only choose one language to get to a decent level. You won't be learning this, and then that, and then another afterwards. You'll most likely give up after the first.

The issue is I've been learning Spanish for 5 years but only at school not listening to spanish media outside of it. My Grammar and Vocab is how you'd expect it to be from only ever learning at school. (Even though here in Germany we are given a good foundation for language learning imo)

I actually have pretty good grades considering that (I had a 2 (like a B in America I think) in my test). When I speak (to others) I get extremely nervous and can barely make a sentence and I have to focus a lot when trying to somewhat comprehend spoken Spanish. This led me to feel like I'm faking it. Especially because (almost) everyone else in my class seems to be so good in Spanish.

The reason for not doing much for Spanish are all these bad associations I have made with language learning because of school.

It means the same thing in both languages. 
Maybe its just like that in the beginning, what i suppose, because i know it will be harder from there of course. 

An other thing that i think about is, that if you have an experience already in one of those languages, is the chance smaller to mix up something? Or would you still have trouble with that?

languagelearning,Anki for comprehension,"Hi all, new poster here and I've recently started an Anki verb conjugation deck for Spanish. The general setup has the user (me) supply the correct conjugation form for each verb given case, person, etc. I've found this to be really helpful in memorizing conjugations to supply when prompted, but I'm not sure how this translates outside of the 'Anki' world, so was hoping to hear about the experiences of other Anki users...

So there are two issues I can see with my current study program. First, that I am primed to recognize and conjugate based on the cues on a given card. The deck has repeated context phrases and symbols to differentiate present, preterite, perfect, future, etc. and I respond almost immediately to those. Do you have study tricks to further strengthen the skill of supplying the conjugated form, in real context/outside of the standardized cues' in Anki?

And then along those lines, I don't know how effective this Anki deck or, more likely, my approach with it, is when it comes to comprehension. I repeatedly think through in terms of getting supplied the cues and the desired verb form, so can create the conjugation that way. If I heard 'hubo' vs 'habia' in conversation, I may not be able to discenr the two past tenses of the verb 'haber'. I imagine this is to be expected from Anki and real-world comprehension is a way to complement Anki studying. Any thoughts here??

languagelearning,Just Passed My DELF A2 - How I Built a Daily Habit and Made the Move from Casual to Serious Learner,"**Introduction**

In November of 2020 I was spinning my wheels. I had been using Duolingo to learn French for probably more than two years, and I knew some of the basics. However, I was barely even A1 level. Any actual French content (especially audio, I could read a small bit) was far out of reach. I wanted to make the jump from casual to serious learner but wasn't sure how. Every time I would come to this sub people would always hate on Duo - but I had been using it for so long, I wouldn't want to lose my streak!! Besides, what else is so much better?

The real issue is that aside from a handful of days that I was ""motivated"", I usually did my 10xp as fast as I could and got off the site. And on the days I was ""motivated"", I might gain 300xp but I was mostly rehashing the same beginner sentences anyway. It was never meaningful study, and even if it was, it wasn't consistent. The missing link wasn't a special program like Anki or Busuu, but a real reason to sit down every day and study for at least 20 minutes. That's when I decided I wanted to shoot for an exam.

A few days ago I found out I passed my DELF A2 exam with a score of 95/100. This post focuses on my journey there in terms of my routine and mindset. I made a separate post in r/French focused on the resources I used, applicable for French learners. Here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/mhh5id/just\_passed\_my\_delf\_a2\_here\_are\_the\_resources\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/mhh5id/just_passed_my_delf_a2_here_are_the_resources_i/)

**Building a Daily Habit**

If you want to start studying consistently everyday, it's helpful to have a time that you regularly study. I found I can be pretty flexible on this, but I just need to be firm with myself that it gets done. I find it helpful to think of it as something I have to do, an obligation. Just like work, or an early morning flight. You probably don't miss either of those, they are simply obligations. I typically study after work on weekdays and after breakfast on weekends. This jumps around a little bit, sometimes I study after supper instead on weekdays. It just depends what else I have going on. I don't need to be too rigid with it. I always find grabbing a warm beverage can help kickstart things if I'm lacking motivation. That will happen of course, because having a daily routine requires discipline not motivation. The motivation will come and go.

**Soft Study, Hard Study**

My hard study routine has remained a duration of about 20-30 minutes but has changed in components since the start (see below). I like having a very approachable hard study requirement. 20 minutes is effective, and not too difficult to push through even on a day I'm not really up for it. I can always add-on with more soft study or additional hard study if I'm up for it. The 20 minutes is the obligation I mentioned earlier. Past that, I'm free to continue, typically by consuming native content, but free to go if I want.

I also naturally fall into a bit of a routine for soft study. For example, I usually listen to a le radiojournal in the morning. Not an obligation, but it's become my favourite way to start the day.

**Your Routine Needs to Evolve**

I didn't keep the same routine for too long. Initially, in November, I listened to a Coffee Break French and then did my Anki cards. By the end of January, I changed to do textbook exercises and then the cards. Now I do the same thing, but with a different textbook. Not changing and adapting my routine as I progressed was one of the reasons I was spinning my wheels for so long. Yes, it sucks there isn't a single program out there you can just follow to go from say 0 to B2 but there isn't. So never be afraid to change the routine up if you feel like you've plateaued or just don't enjoy what your doing any more (for a reasonably long amount of time, not enjoying one or two days here and there is just something you need to deal with in this hobby).

**A Goal is a Must**

The biggest thing that set me on the track for success was setting a hard goal and sticking to it. I decided in November to target the A2 after watching the A2 Oral example listed in my French resources post. I'll be setting my B1 timeline shortly. You don't have to take a test, but I do think it is a good idea to have a level in mind and a timeline to get there. If you are taking a test, you won't feel ready. You probably won't get everything done you wanted. That's okay. That's how I felt. I took it and passed with flying colours.

**Conclusion**

Thanks for reading! This is really just a start, an A2 level is helpful for travel but not much else. However, I'm stoked about the progress and already well on my way to B1. Hopefully I can update that flair again in a few months time!

TL;DR: To make the move from casual to serious learner, you need to set a goal and establish a daily routine. It isn't about motivation, it's about discipline. It's not easy but it is very rewarding. Hang in there.",1617407296,ryebread761,5

languagelearning,Can I become 100% in my mother-tongue language that I barely speak anymore,"Since 6 years old I grew up speaking Lithuanian in an English-speaking country. When I started school I picked up English really quick. As I got better, I started incorporating English in my Lithuanian conversations at home and now I would say that everything I speak at home is 60% English 40% Lithuanian. Even my parents say that my Lithuanian has degraded dramatically as I grew up and it's disappointing to hear that I probably won't be able to communicate fluently in the future.

So is anyone else having this 'so-called' problem? My goal is to relearn Lithuanian as I can't even communicate with my relatives properly anymore when I visit home during the Summer. I have to admit that the language is brutally difficult and there's not a lot resources given that it's not that popular. 

Better yet, I would like to focus on the written side as well, as I have never wrote down a word in Lithuanian. That would also explain that my reading is quite poor. Speaking is fine as long as I keep things short, such as replying to a question, but when it comes to explaining things, I do struggle. Finally, my listening is great, even if I don't recognize some words I can still figure out what is being said.

So is it possible to become fluent given this type of situation. I say fluent because I won't have an accent since I spoke it at home, as opposed to learning it from scratch. Any advice would be appreciated.",1617398925,LithuanianTissue,5
languagelearning,Highlighting techniques for learning vocabulary,"I have two really small tips for learning vocabulary, especially for beginners. 

First, when you are reading/copying down content in the language, I know a lot of people will highlight words that they don't know so they can look them up. But when you are a beginner, having to highlight basically everything might feel a little overwhelming--it's also impossible to un-highlight it once you've learned the word. So, I've started highlighting the words I *do* recognize. I feel motivated to learn the words that I haven't highlighted yet because it is satisfying to watch the page fill up with the color (if it's a color I like).

My second tiny tip is for when you are journaling in the language. All I do is highlight/underline any word or phrase that I pulled from a translation app. That way, when I am flipping through the journal later on, I am able to see what areas I was struggling with. It also encourages me to think hard about what I am trying to write, rather than completely relying on google translate.

Everyone is different, so maybe these won't be as helpful to you all as they were to me. But I hope you might be encouraged to find whatever small hacks work for your learning style, whether that be a particular color-coding system or something else :)",1617397944,zoglow,5

languagelearning,Newcomer Learning Italian - First Week,"Hi Language Learning Community! 

I wanted to reach out and see if I could get some feedback from some who are more knowledgeable that myself on language learning. 

I've wanted to learn Italian for many years now - and I've attempted once with Babbel but gave up. I took advantage of a Sale last summer and sill have till August to use the subscription. After watching Tucci's special on CNN I decided NOW IS THE TIME as I have an even stronger itch to travel there and explore. 

I've read through many ""beginner"" posts in this form, and did read the PDF that was created for this group. I am using Babbel along side a Podcast (Coffee Break Italian) and a manual falsh card system. 

I've lightly done the first two episodes of the podcast, as I understood I should focus on the beginnings of the app and nail down pronunciation first and foremost, and then go to manual flash cards while continuing to progress in Babbel. 

So here is why I am here - 

In the last 10 days, I've completed both Newcomer ""courses"". Thing is - I am REALLY struggling to recall many of the phrases/words that they've introduced early on. Immediately starting convicting some verbs and I can't tell if this is poorly introduced this early (my husband who is fluent in Spanish was shocked I got that so early on in the app) OR if I am approaching the study sessions incorrectly. 

I'm hesitant to go on to the next ""course"" labeled beginners because other than asking What is your name and understanding the pronouns and SOME of the conjugations -- I am really struggling in the review sessions. 

Any thoughts, ideas, study suggestions, different approaches, etc - really ANYTHING would be greatly appreciated. I am not giving up, I am just seeking some help/guidance. 

Thank you in advance for your help!",1617397480,mellonsr,28

languagelearning,How do I help my sister learn a language?,"So, Before I get any answers, Its a good idea to explain:

Bassically, My sister needs to learn a language to get into her desired field of work, When I heard this, I instantly jumped at the oppurtunity to help her learn a language since I am a GIANT language geek. When I asked her what language she wanted to learn she said French since she was told it should be easy (Which it should be since her native language is English). So, She started learning it and I started helping her, There is one MAJOR problem though. I dont know how to properly explain this, but, She thinks that French follows all the same rules as English. An example is when we were talking about French genders, She thought that because genders are not important in English (Technically we dont even have them) they must not be important in French. When I tried to explain to her that the genders in French are Important she said ""But, Thats not how it works in English, So what makes French different?"" I tried to explain to her that French is a different language with its own rules and quirks but she denied this and said that ""I know nothing"". Another example is when she said that the French phrase ""Je m'appelle"" is pronounced like it was an English word, Like the J is pronounced the way we say it in English or when she refuses to pronounce the words she learns properly. She also refuses to try and improve her accent since she thinks that its not important and that they will understand her and it dosent matter, Its hard to try and explain her logic ngl. Anyway, She refuses to accept that French has its own rules but still needs to learn it, She is thinking off switching to German but given how she has reacted to French, I honestly dont think she can learn German. How can I help her? 

Also for more context: We are close to the same age, Its not like she is a child. Wont say her age for privacy reasons.",1617317005,Gloomy_Breadfruit_10,51

I get really frustrated when teachers (or anyone) try and ascertain your language level by testing you on a pretty obscure topic. For instance, I just had a trail lesson with a tutor, and she read me a passage (listening is my worst topic by far, which I’d already told her) about recent developments in cancer treatments. 

I don’t know any of that vocabulary! But she decided that because I couldn’t understand that, I was a beginner and tried to teach me the words for “cat” and “dog”. I CAN talk in great detail about my life, my upcoming wedding and things I’m actually interested in.

I understand that being able to talk about a huge array of subjects is important for c1/c2 tests, but I don’t think it’s fair to judge b level students from that, and I’ve got it a lot recently.

languagelearning,"Dear Future Multi-Language Speaker,"," 

Did you know, that there are over 6,000 languages spoken in the world today? Crazy, right?

There’s an entirely new world of knowledge out there, but some people simply aren’t drawn towards it enough to go past the high school requirement of a second language.

Well, I’m happy to inform you, you’re not a part of that group.

If you’re reading this, it’s probably because you’re almost ready to start this new journey in your life.

But you haven’t quite yet because something is holding you back.

Fear when learning a language is hard to overcome. All of the thoughts of failure, mispronunciation, or translating something incorrectly and replying with the wrong saying can be overwhelming.

I get it. 

But that shouldn’t keep you from venturing out into other languages.

In the beginning, I was terrified of learning Spanish. I didn’t have faith in my learning abilities so this challenge was intimidating. I didn’t—and still don’t— like the possibility of failure and making mistakes because I tend to remind myself of them every single day after it happened. Voices in my head telling me 20 times a day that “I should’ve known better” or “ that was a dumb mistake”. I’ve realized throughout my journey that it’s a lot easier to be harder on yourself compared to others. But the important thing is to try not to be.

This isn’t an easy thing to do. It takes time, patience, mistakes, and forgiveness to learn something of this magnitude, especially when it comes to putting in the physical and mental work.

At first, I didn’t realize how much effort and work—physically and mentally— this was going to take. Learning it now, I still have some of those thoughts, but they aren’t as loud as they used to be compared to when I started. It’s because I learned how to be patient with myself, and I didn’t beat myself up over mistakes that anyone could’ve made. Learning this mindset was one of the best things I could’ve done. But it doesn't happen over-night and it can get demotivating sometimes.

The best thing to do during times of demotivation is to think of everything that you will be able to do once you’ve learned it. You can:  

Travel freely to other countries without a dictionary on hand 24/7.

Study abroad in countries and learn firsthand.

Have an easier time communicating with native speakers or figuring out if you’re in the right location while in a different country.

Help others who may not be comfortable using your native language.

Watch TV shows, movies, and listen to music in that language and not have to worry about keeping up subtitles

Help others translate in the store if there is a language barrier.

Add it to your resume to higher your chances of getting a job etc.

I haven’t made it to that stage in my journey yet, but I can’t wait until I do. 

Don’t let your fears keep you from doing something so amazing. It’s time to take that first step.

I wish you good luck on your journey.

Sincerely, a girl who’s still learning herself",1617288483,Ok-Bet-442879,4

Even though I've improved theoughout the years work is not kind to mistakes and results matter regardless of your background, religion, or disability.

I tend to make mistakes with prepositions, punctuation, and some of the less commonly used verb tenses . Like I had to look up ""at your leisure"" because I wasn't sure of the preposition.

I want to create a mini dictionary of all words, terms, and affixes I have learnt through my journey learning this language. I have currently three choices:

* Take notes and write down vocabulary manually
   * In a notebook
   * Advantages:
      * Easily write with the native script
      * Improve handwriting
   * Disadvantages:
      * Hand hurts
      * Have to find the notebook every time
      * Have to bring right stationary tools like erasers and rulers all the time.
* Take notes and write down vocabulary digitally
   * In a computer
   * Advantages:
      * Easy typing
      * Flexible and usable all the time (I stay home for months without going outside)
      * Accidents are easily reverted
      * Hand does not hurt
   * Disadvantages:
      * I have to paint my keyboard to write in the native script
      * Will not really help improve my memory
* Do not take notes
   * All the vocabulary will be in my head
   * Advantages
      * No instruments needed
      * Improve memory
   * Disadvantages
      * I already know quite some vocabulary from 6 different languages from which I am fluent in 3. Memory probably does not need much improvement.
      * Possibly forget vocabulary

I feel so very good about this every time I’m realizing what I’m doing right now: I’m actually learning the meaning of words of another language (in my case Japanese, French and Spanish atm) in English. No more “Merci - Danke” but instead “Merci - Thank you”. This makes me really proud. 

I actually started this because I realized the courses I took in Memrise sometimes had very minor mistakes. I figured the English courses would be done with a lot more care, considering a bigger amount of people using them. 

What language is it that you learn your new languages in? How did it work for you so far? In case you haven’t tired yet, I can highly recommend it!

languagelearning,Advice for getting into teaching?,"Hello everybody,

Just a short background story:

I went through some life-changing events within a relatively short amount of time recently, which has let me to start prioritizing my inner needs.

Most importantly, I have successfully cut my hours from 40 down to 32 as I simply do not want to dedicate that amount of time to a single company/project anymore. I am essentially getting an extra day off per week from next month on and I am starting to explore how I want to use all of that time.

I have an inner-calling to teach languages and I am wondering whether I should take private students on or not. I genuinely love language learning and teaching all by themselves, so it feels like a no-brainer to me. Unfortunately, i have pretty much 0 experience in teaching languages, which makes me question my ability to successfully promote myself.

I would love to teach Dutch, but I have no dutch language certificates to show for it. I am a just a dude who has picked up a few languages throughout his life and has recently stuck with dutch, as I have lived there for the last 2 years. I have had so many conversations regarding my near native level that I have attained within the last 2 years of loving there and maybe a year of studying before that.

How can I get a start into teaching languages? I would love to pick it up and see where it takes me, but for now I would just like to have 3-4 students per week and just earn some extra money in the process.

It's my first genuine attempt of making 'a hobby into a job', so hopefully you can share some advice?",1617223790,VestaCeres2202,5

Either way back home we have a cultural thing where we refer to most older men of that background as amo no matter their language or actually being our uncle or not, as sort of a sign of respect and also just a cultural thing we’re just used to 

I live in the uk now and there’s an old Persian man in my neighbourhood who’s helped me with a few things, I just wanted to make sure he would appreciate being called that or would it be weird? I don’t know if it’s a phenomenon the different diasporas have started together in Sweden or if it is normal among natives as well. 

Basically I want to do it as a sign of respect and also I assume someone might be happy hearing something from their language, but yeah since it means uncle I just wanted to know if he would find it weird if a guy he’s not related to and recently met would call him that or would it be normal/appreciated for him

I still do some fuck ups from time to time but I consider my English to be okay. About 90% of the content I watch on Youtube is in English and I understand pretty much 100% of it.

However, when I watch a movie, I can barely understand anything. I miss whole sentences where I don't understand a single word. I have to put a considerable effort to understand what's going on and I often have to go back a couple times to understand something or even turn on subtitles.

Why is that? Why am I able to listen to a 6 hour podcast of three people speaking and I can understand literally 100% of it but when I watch a movie I miss so much words and sentences?

Context: 

Born in Taiwan, raised in Canada. I speak native English, very fluent Mandarin and Taiwanese (Minnan Hokkien). Learned Japanese for 2 years in university, but I would say basic fluency only. 

I am trying to decide what I should learn in my free time: 1. Learning to read more Chinese (I can read maybe 1500 characters right now..), so I can improve my vocabulary. 2. Increasing Japanese fluency to a level that is actually useful. 3. Learning a new useful language like French since I live and work in Canada. 4.

languagelearning,English is causing problems with my native language.,"Hello! I am a 17-year-old from Poland and I'm obsessed with languages. Particularly English. I taught myself how to speak it when I was about 11 and by age 13 I was almost fluent (I'm very proud of little me! ) but when I turned 14 some problems started popping up. I kept forgetting everyday words in polish and could only remember them in English to the point where it felt like I never knew that word in the first place. Then over the years, I started pronouncing some polish words like in English which I usually play off as a joke but it's starting to bother me.   
I met with my math tutor this week and when she came into the room my brain expected her to start speaking English and when I heard polish I felt confused and for a few minutes I felt like I couldn't switch languages and it was hard to focus on what she was saying and I barely understood anything. I looked at the math book in front of me and read a few sentences in my head which brought me back but I still felt weird about it afterward. I always felt like I was good at separating multiple languages in my head but these incidents are getting more and more frequent.  
I was wondering if anybody has any idea on why this is happening or how to avoid those situations?  


I speak polish at home and at school but I mostly stay on the English side of the internet and text native English speakers. Aside from those two languages I'm A2 in Russian and actively learning Norwegian and Japanese with a little bit of German.",1617128198,tpvv413,3

languagelearning,"Totally stuck, can't choose what to learn","Ok so I've been struggling to learn languages for a long time and as far as I can tell the main issue is motivation. 

In school we had to learn irish from ages 6-18, I can maybe ask where the bathroom or for a cup of tea. Most Irish people can't speak it so that's pretty normal, only a handful of counties really need it and it's more of a cultural heritage thing at this point. 

I had to learn French from 13-18 and really don't speak any. Didn't enjoy it at all. 

Tried learning some Polish at the start of this year and couldn't find the time for it and ended up just quitting by saying I'll get back to it. A lot of people in Ireland speak it so I hear it now anc then just through my day or week. 

The hard one. German. I've been trying to learn German on and off since I was 16. I'm 26. I can never stay at it. Tried a one on one tutor basically lost interest. Tried a book ""teach yourself: complete german"". Most recently I tried watching shows in German, listening to music, listening to the Coffee break German podcast, using the same book and using duolingo in off time when I can't get anything else in. I think I want to finally quit German and try something else. It's been my white whale but I think I need to try something else. 

I've considered Japanese because of my interest in anime and manga but honestly looking at Japanese I know it's too hard. I won't stick that out and I've known too many people who fell into the anime language trap. 

Korean was another one because it's easier seeming than Japanese and the writing system seems interesting. Plus it has plenty of music and shows I enjoy. Just afraid thats another anime trap. 

My main motivation is to be able to enjoy the media from another country in that language, at some point the occasional holiday. Full immersion moving isn't an option. A while back I wanted to be able to speak a few languages but one other than English is all I'm after now.",1617126350,Thingy27,18

languagelearning,I have a question about language,"Me and one of my brothers made up some of our own words, and eventually started using them in their own sentences separated from any English.

The pseudo-language has enough vocabulary we can generally communicate what want to to some degree. We did not sit down and decide “hey, let’s make a language”, it developed on its own and we eventually started using it as a language. We call it Lumian in English, and Lumago in the pseudo-language. What would me and my brother call our ability to speak this pseudo-language? It has continued developing, so we are able to communicate more complex things every day, and we are the only people who speak it. Would we call ourselves native speakers, or would this small pseudo-language not count?

Of course it all depends on what your first language is but generally English is not easier than say French or Chinese or whatever. They all have their very-hard-to-get parts. There are no easy languages at all because all of them convey the whole cultures. Sometimes it seems like people expect you to know English by default and have no trouble with it because it's just common but no, learning English is another effort you should make and should not underestimate I guess.

languagelearning,Which country would you like to emigrate to?,"I’m wondering which country you live in and where you would rather like to live, language-wise. 

I know for a fact that I don’t want to spend all my life in Germany. Politically, economically etc. it’s a great country. Sure it does have a few laws where you genuinely wonder why on earth you would need a law for such small thing, but it’s acceptable. I didn’t have any trouble yet, and that’s a good thing. 

But choosing a country to live in is so difficult for me. There are a few languages I am very passionate about: Chinese, Japanese, English ofc, French and Spanish. 

As for the latter two, I learned French for three years and suck, and I barely know Spanish at all, but I know it would be easy to learn. And both countries are pretty close to me, so I would be able to regularly visit my family. My grandma even lives in Spain!

As for Chinese and Japanese I’m also not fluent, but I’d be ambitious enough to get better at it. The big con against living in either country is: I’m terrified of natural catastrophes. Living in Europe every kind of catastrophe just happens somewhere else, I’ve never been affected by anything worse than lots of heat, cold or ice rain. That can’t be compared to hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis. I can’t live there because I wouldn’t feel safe considering this. 

The easiest option for me would be moving to an anglophone country then. I’m fluent, I love this language so much and there are a lot of countries that I admire. 

I would just love to emigrate to America, but I’m honestly scared because of what I learn from the media: guns, Karens and also natural catastrophes. Crime seems to be a daily thing (I watch too much TV shows from America, maybe it’s not even that bad). But I love the American culture, especially in LA, because from what I see on the media it’s lovely people from everywhere, they do roller skating a lot and people don’t seem to care if you’re different. That’s the spirit I like. 

It’s so far away though, so I will probably stick to the UK. Close to my home, so many sweet accents, it’s just great. And it doesn’t seem dangerous at all! 

The Scandinavian countries are also very great, and I think you can get along there pretty well just knowing English, right? I still consider going there as well. 

There are too many options and I’ve got no idea how to decide!

Another thing you have to consider when emigrating is your job, obviously. So what do you all work as, or want to work as after emigrating to your chosen country? 

I’m pretty lucky because I’m still in college. I have so many options to choose from and I can consider the emigration plan when deciding on a job. But even with a lot of options, I still don’t know what to do. There are so many jobs and they have different qualities. My father said if I wanted to work abroad it would be best to choose something that is wanted there. He’s often been abroad and he said German bread is something people love. Is that true? And the same with German engineering or psychology (that’s apparently because of the accent, it’s said to be calming (can’t relate, I hate my accent lmao)).",1617091322,Ottaro666,113

languagelearning,Learning different language affecting native language?,"Gonna preface this by saying I know this sounds stupid and I'm very aware it's gonna sound like I'm just trying to be quirky or something, but I genuinely just want to know this is another common language thing. I know that sometimes temporarily forgetting words and phrases from your native language as you learn a second is a common and observed thing. However this is a tad bit different, and my friends have teased me enough as to where I want some info to be able to present them with next time.

English is my first language, with Spanish as my (somewhat fluent) second. I've experienced the aforementioned little mix-ups between languages that come with the territory. No biggie. However, my in-progress third language is Swedish, and here is where my brain short circuits. 

Swedish pronunciation has been rather difficult for me to get a hold of, resulting in me heavily immersing myself in hearing swedish and repeating sounds of the language more strenuously than I had to do for Spanish (I grew up really close with a Spanish speaking family so I've always heard it). A while back, I noticed that the way I talk in English has been slightly affected. Particularly with the ""oo"" sound. Words like ""soup"" and ""YouTube"" with that sound are now being said with a 'y' before the sound, so soup becomes ""syoup"", and YouTube becomes ""YouTyube."" This has been going on for the better part of a year now, even after I paused my swedish studies. Beyond the occasional joke at my pronunciation, I haven't really thought much about it until a week or so ago, when passing a sign for Ruby Falls, when trying to talk about it my brain just about imploded as I started to say Ruby and realized that something was really off with what I was saying and I was trying to somehow correct myself as I was saying it. After a few more tries, I realized the way I say ruby now is more like ""ryoob-yeh"" which is completely nonsensical and not swedish at all and I'm very confused. 

So does anyone have some info on why my native language is being impacted so heavily like this? Does this also fall under language attrition or is this something different? Spanish didn't do this to me at all, so the only thing I can think of as a cause is that I was having so much trouble with swedish to begin with that it overcompensated and malfunctioned somewhere along the way? Is it a brain tumor?? Help me so I don't feel so cringed out by my own speaking please, if I know there's a scientific phrase for this I'll feel way better.

languagelearning,should i learn two languages at the same time?,"tl;dr: i need to become fluent in Dutch within the next few years for my career. i would like to continue studying Italian to speak to my relatives, but pausing to study Dutch instead will result in forgetting the language. should I study both at the same time?

I am a native English speaker. I want to become fluent in Dutch and Italian and am wondering if I should learn both at the same time or one after the other. 

I plan on studying clinical psychology at a Dutch university and pursuing a career in the Netherlands. I will need to become fluent in Dutch to work as a healthcare professional. I am three years away from applying to graduate programs so I figure now is a good time to start learning the language. 

I am of Italian heritage with many relatives living in Italy. Most of them speak English but I’d love to communicate with them in Italian, and it is a beautiful language. I studied Italian for six years and unfortunately gave up when I began attending university. I was almost fluent, with the exception of some vocabulary. It’s only been three years since I stopped practicing but I can barely hold a conversation. Do you think it would be relatively easy to relearn what I previously knew? Italian is a lesser priority than Dutch but the longer I go without practicing, the more of it I will forget. 

I recently downloaded Duolingo to practice both languages. Dutch is easy so far and I really enjoy speaking it. I recognize most of the Italian so far but it is pretty hazy.

But today i was in my college writing class on zoom and we were doing a discussion and midway through my discussion point i started to speak in Spanish and idk why. I didn’t try it’s like i was talk and it just came out. I don’t remember what point i was making but i said something like “what I’m trying to explain is that it’s como eso, o sea lo que quiero decir” and i just froze because i was shocked, and surprised. I will usually do something like this when I’m translating at work for a costumer. My brain might get stuck in Spanish and it takes a few seconds to switch back to English. But I’ve never had Spanish come out when i was just speaking English. But this gave me the confidence boost I’ve been missing these last few weeks. This showed me that my brain is not thinking of Spanish so much as a foreign language but more of a second language. It showed me that my little world of “immersion” is working. It’s kind of a silly thing that happened today but it made my day so much better. 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this. If so I’d love to hear about it",1617061836,Typical_Breath_9811,2

languagelearning,Lefthanders Unite!,"In the English language, you write from left to right, so left-handers may end up smudging the text or have to write in such a way so that the hand does not smudge the text. Also, if you are a left-hander, then a composition notebook would be a better option than a spiral notebook, because the metal rings of the spiral notebook are not comfortable when your left hand or arm is in the way. 

In the Chinese language, Chinese characters come in squares and can be written vertically, from right to left, but published books that do this tend to be from the Republic of China (aka Taiwan) or maybe Hong Kong. I remember a non-Chinese YouTuber was reading a Cantonese novel, and the book was written vertically, from right to left. You may think that it has no left-handed bias, but here's the catch. If you want to make your characters look prettier and more calligraphic, it actually becomes tremendously easier to use your right hand because of the direction of the brushstrokes.

languagelearning,My idea of C2 has crumbled. Even C2 seems very far away from native or fluent,"I'm a native english speaker. Out of curiosity, I decided to watch videos on Youtube of people taking exams for CEFR levels in English, to see where I'd like to reach in a foreign language.

For C2, I was expecting to see people who were effectively fluent, as in they can use the language in a very fluid way, potentially with uncommon words, without pausing, and could be confused for a native speaker if they did not have a foreign accent. I see that this is not the case. In fact, it seems that C2 is almost a minimum, actually. These people are blatantly foreign and are not fluid at all.

When I see this, that idea that I've heard before, of reading great books in their native language, completely crumbles. These people are C2 and honestly could never, for example, read Shakespeare or James Joyce and so on. How could I ever hope to read Dostoyevsky or Goethe and so on if I were to learn Russian or German?

The several people I know who are foreign but have an ability superior to these C2 examples have all learned English from age ~6 and even attended university for English in a few cases, and still could never read to such level. It seems like a hopeless idea that you're going to read these great books and understand any of the nuances if you understand any of the writing at all.

I'm not sure of the purpose to this thread other than to air my grievence. I thought that C2 was effectively ""almost native with an accent"", but it seems more so like ""enough to work in the country and function but still very obviously foreign"".

When I think of how I speak english, and I see these C2 people, it's just so far away. The level of connection is just too far. I'm not sure. Even C2 is not enough to understand nuance, it seems. This is my immediate reaction to seeing these several examples. It's enough to function, but that's it.

I feel like this will seem rude. Everyone says that reaching C2 is so challenging and it must be and such effort is something to be commended. I'd love to reach C2 in a foreign language, but my idea of what that looks like has deflated dramatically. I thought that I'd be confused with natives as long as I reduced my accent, but it just doesn't look like that is the case.",1617044444,AidePast,70

&gt;Longtemps, je me suis couché de bonne heure. Parfois, à peine ma bougie éteinte, mes yeux se fermaient si vite que je n'avais pas le temps de me dire : « Je m'endors. » Et, une demi- heure après, la pensée qu'il était temps de chercher le sommeil m'éveillait ; je voulais poser le volume que je croyais avoir dans les mains et souffler ma lumière ; je n'avais pas cessé en dormant de faire des réflexions sur ce que je venais de lire, mais ces réflexions avaient pris un tour un peu particulier ; il me semblait que j'étais moi-même ce dont parlait l'ouvrage : une église, un quatuor, la rivalité de François Ier et de Charles-Quint. Cette croyance survivait pendant quelques secondes à mon réveil ; elle ne choquait pas ma raison, mais pesait comme des écailles sur mes yeux et les empêchait de se rendre compte que le bougeoir n'était plus allumé. Puis elle commençait à me devenir inintelligible, comme après la métempsycose les pensées d'une existence antérieure ; le sujet du livre se détachait de moi, j'étais libre de m'y appliquer ou non ; aussitôt je recouvrais la vue et j'étais bien étonné de trouver autour de moi une obscurité, douce et reposante pour mes yeux, mais peut-être plus encore pour mon esprit, à qui elle apparaissait comme une chose sans cause, incompréhensible, comme une chose vraiment obscure. Je me demandais quelle heure il pouvait être ; j'entendais le sifflement des trains qui, plus ou moins éloigné, comme le chant d'un oiseau dans une forêt, relevant les distances, me décrivait l'étendue de la campagne déserte où le voyageur se hâte vers la station prochaine ; et le petit chemin qu'il suit va être gravé dans son souvenir par l'excitation qu'il doit à des lieux nouveaux, à des actes inaccoutumés, à la causerie récente et aux adieux sous la lampe étrangère qui le suivent encore dans le silence de la nuit, à la douceur prochaine du retour.

&gt;For a long time I would go to bed early. Sometimes, the candle barely out, my eyes closed so quickly that I did not have time to tell myself: “I’m falling asleep.” And half an hour later the thought that it was time to look for sleep would awaken me; I would make as if to put away the book which I imagined was still in my hands, and to blow out the light; I had gone on thinking, while I was asleep, about what I had just been reading, but these thoughts had taken a rather peculiar turn; it seemed to me that I myself was the immediate subject of my book: a church, a quartet, the rivalry between François I and Charles V. This impression would persist for some moments after I awoke; it did not offend my reason, but lay like scales upon my eyes and prevented them from registering the fact that the candle was no longer burning. Then it would begin to seem unintelligible, as the thoughts of a previous existence must be after reincarnation; the subject of my book would separate itself from me, leaving me free to apply myself to it or not; and at the same time my sight would return and I would be astonished to find myself in a state of darkness, pleasant and restful enough for my eyes, but even more, perhaps, for my mind, to which it appeared incomprehensible, without a cause, something dark indeed.",1617039705,MonGooEY,6

languagelearning,Learning a new language and the Difficulty Curve,"Good day to you all.

I'm an English and French student (Preparing C1 and B2 respectively), I'm approaching to get a higher level in both languages, in consequence I must continue with a new language and continue expanding my knowledge.

Thinking about which language should I study next, I've arrived to the conclusion that languages are divided in four different groups depending on how much different they are from your native language. (*Totally Subjective Idea*)

For example, for a native Spanish speaker.

* **Level 1**: Languages that has lots of similitudes with your native one and, such as Portuguese or Italian (At this level in my opinion I think that we should find English too).
* **Level 2**:Languages such as German or Dutch, that still uses the same alphabet but the grammar and vocabulary is very different.
* **Level 3:** Languages that not belongs to the same family and has a different alphabet but still using the syllabic writing, such as Arabic or Korean.
* **Level 4:** Languages that are completely different in every term (Grammar, Vocabulary, Writing system…), such as Japanese or Chinese.

So, basically the next language that should I learn is someone from the second level. However, if we think carefully, is not better to study first a language from third level instead of second one?

At first sight, I could find some advantages: Firstly, if we learn a more difficult language first, we are younger so we have more time to spend in this language and we are better memorizing new vocabulary and grammar structures. In addition, with one of these difficult languages at long term you will get much more experience with a level 3/4 language than with one from level 2, making that when you decide to learn a level 2 language would be much more easier.

In conclusion, learn a new languages always would be a new challenge even if you choose a language from level two, three or four. Although, at long term confronting first a laborious language will have much more rewards that with an easier one.

* What do you think about this theory?
* What do you think that is better? Follow the first path (Level 1,2,3,4) or the second one (Level 1,3,4,2).

I've tried to learn Russian for more than a year now, and I have some difficulties. I think the main one is that I focus so much on my mistakes that I came to a point where I really fear to make some. This led to me avoiding actual practice or thinking that it was actually impossible to learn such language bc my native language (french) is too simple compared to Russian. This applies for grammar mistakes but also vocabulary mistakes. Except that of course making mistakes is a huge part of the process but idk how to get over it.

 I've dropped Russian a few months ago but now I've a unique opportunity to go on Erasmus to Poland. I took absolute beginner's course in uni but of course this hasn't done much (2h/week online is surprisingly ineffective, but I wasn't expecting much either). And I feel like I have the same problem with polish whenever I do a mistake I'm just like ""whatever this is too complex for me why am I even trying"". Like all this grammar feels superficial and artificially complex, which I know isn't true but still feels like it when I'm working. I don't know what to do to actually change my mentality or gain my motivation back. I had plenty of motivation with Russian I managed to study it for more than a year even though it wasn't going well. But for polish even if it's necessary and I'd really like it, it feels like it's impossible. As you can see I probably made a ton of mistakes in English but I don't feel bad about it, so I don't really know why I have such feeling with polish or Russian. 

Do anyone have any advice? I of course know that language learning takes years to get anywhere. But I'd like to get back to work and enjoy it.

languagelearning,Am I native in a language I grew up surrounded with but not spoken much myself?," I'm from Kazakhstan, a post-soviet country in central Asia. The country is bilingual, but the separation between Russian and Kazakh speakers is rather rough. My household spoke evenly in both, but the cable shows I grew up watching were dubbed only in Russian and then I went to the Russian speaking school (they are separated by primary language). Later I was transferred to a Kazakh speaking high-school, where I found my  Kazakh lacking and did not even speak it because I was ashamed of stuttering in my 'mother tongue.'   
Now, I am confused on wether I am bilingual or not.  Kazakh is a Turkic language written in Cyrillic. Being surrounded with it my whole youth, I can understand most of the everyday language intuitively if not explicitly. Anything more complicated than a smalltalk sounds like gibberish to me. I tried to read some of the texts out-loud and it seems that I don't have any apparent accent. However, my active vocabulary is so abysmal that I couldn't bring myself to write a paragraph in Kazakh if my life depended on it.

languagelearning,where seldom is heard a discouraging word. backwards syntax?,"where seldom is heard a discouraging word. backwards syntax?

not sure if this is where to post this question... but .....

in the chorus of the song home on the range is the line ""where seldom is heard a discouraging word""

i'm not a linguist, so i don't know the technical way to describe my question, but it appears this uses some sort of backwards syntax of the phrase in question.

every time i hear this song i have to think about this phrase a few times to understand it's meaning.

to me, it would make more sense if the line was re-phrased ""A discouraging word is seldom(ly) heard""

Not sure how to break this down, but the former seems to use the noun (""word"") in the 2nd part of the phrase, whereas the latter example, the noun (""word"") is starting off the phrase.

Does anyone know what this type of ""backwards"" syntax is called? Can anyone think of any other examples in common songs or poems, etc..?

The only other example I can think of is slightly different and is from the poem twas the night before christmas in the opening line. ""‘Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house, Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse""

Here, one might argue the ""clearer"" phrase structure might be presented as ""Not even a mouse was stirring all through the house""

Obviously the poem is using creativity in it's form an thus the example I have given isn't sticking to the poems format and the example I have given would make much sense in the poem's context.

Anyways.. Pardon my linguistic ignorance, but this has always bugged me and would love to know the exact linguistic terminology of the home on the range example. (if any)

I had a somewhat consistent schedule going for a minute recently, but I lost my drive for it. Right now, today, I kind of feel it again. But I want to change how I view learning a language. The thing is, I want to learn Russian because it's just a cool sounding language. I don't have any crazy aspirations to go abroad and all that (I guess if I learned enough, it would be cool to go to Russia or something). Part of what I want to be able to do is read Russian books (ideally: read Dostoevsky in Russian).

I think my issue is that I like reading and writing in a different language, but I don't like speaking. Speaking is the hardest part (maybe listening is harder, but they're similar). I barely like speaking in English, same with any other language, but I know it's an important part of it

It just never felt like it was integrated into my life. It's always been this thing I work on for about an hour, and then I go about my life. Which is sort of expected... I mean I've gone 22 years with just English, it's not like I'm suddenly going to find a ""use"" for a second language.

I’ve been thinking about learning more languages for fun. How efficient would it be to do it a different way than normal. 

For example, let’s say I wanted to learn a Germanic language. From my month of research, Old English, Old Frisian, Old Norse, and Old High German were all somewhat mutually intelligible, or they could at least get their point across. So could you go backwards in time with the English language, learn one of the similar sister languages, and learn forward?

languagelearning,Learning a new language and the Difficulty Curve,"Good day to you all.

I'm an English and French student (Preparing C1 and B2 respectively), I'm approaching to get a higher level in both languages, in consequence I must continue with a new language and continue expanding  my knowledge.

Thinking about which language should I study next, I've arrived to the conclusion that languages are divided in four different groups depending on how much different they are from your native language. (*Totally Subjective Idea*)

For example, for a native Spanish speaker.

* **Level 1**: Languages that has lots of similitudes with your native one and, such as Portuguese or Italian (At this level in my opinion I think that we should find English too).
* **Level 2:**Languages such as German or Dutch, that still uses the same alphabet but the grammar and vocabulary is very different.
* **Level 3:** Languages that not belongs to the same family and has a different alphabet but still using the syllabic writing, such as Arabic or Korean.
* **Level 4:** Languages that are completely different in every term (Grammar, Vocabulary, Writing system…), such as Japanese or Chinese.

So, basically the next language that should I learn is someone from the second level. However, if we think carefully, is not better to study first a language from third level instead of second one?

At first sight, I could find some advantages: Firstly, if we learn a more difficult language first, we are younger so we have more time to spend in this language and we are better memorizing new vocabulary and grammar structures. In addition, with one of these difficult languages at long term you will get much more experience with a level 3/4 language than with one from level 2, making that when you decide to learn a level 2 language would be much more easier. 

In conclusion, learn a new languages always would be a new challenge even if you choose a language from level two, three or four. Although, at long term confronting first a laborious language will have much more rewards that with an easier one.

languagelearning,How do you learn to make a language “click” or make “sense”?,"Hi everyone!  I’m currently trying to learn Italian, as I’ve always thought it was a beautiful language.  Historically I’ve always been a poor language learner (my inability to retain 7 years of French study are a testament to that) but I’d like to find a method that works for me! 

One of the major obstacles seems to be an inability to really comprehend a sentence or a word the way I can in English.  For example, hearing something like “I like to eat apples” in English instantly resonates, but if said in another language the phrase devolves into a jumble of syllables that I have to piece together word by word.  No matter how hard I try, it never clicks, even if I’ve learned and internalized the translation.  The words always sound and feel foreign to me, even if I’ve been exposed to the language for years.

languagelearning,Should I learn Dutch or German? A fun but difficult choice...,"[I have read the wiki] I am moving to Maastricht in The Netherlands this summer to start a year-long Master’s degree. I am a 21 year older American and I also speak Spanish (went to a bilingual school starting from age 5), Italian (certified C1), and am learning French (currently about  B1). While it’s important to me to keep improving the languages I already have, I’m very excited to move to such an international city in Europe and would like to try and pick up another. 

My Master’s degree is entirely in English, but I like the idea of learning Dutch a lot. I think it’d be a great way to show respect for and interest in Dutch culture while living there and hopefully help me forge deeper relationships with the people I meet. It’s always been important to me to pick up basics of a language before visiting any country—I never want to be the American who expects everyone to cater to my English. I’d get free Dutch courses alongside my degree and obviously have lots of opportunity to practice. Since I’ve never studied a new Germanic language besides my native English, I appreciate how close Dutch is to what I know—I’m not the “pick the hardest language possible” kind of polyglot :)

At the same time, I am tempted to learn German. There are lots of Germans in Maastricht so I’d also have easy access to tutoring and friends. German-speaking Belgium and Germany are both pretty close to Maastricht. My lifelong best friend is from Berlin, which is also one of my favorite cities that I’ve visited and I could easily see moving there one day. I have a pipe dream about living in Switzerland in the future. I’m hoping to go to law school after my Masters degree, and the idea of having German in addition to my other languages on my CV is exciting. German, while not mandatory, is also relevant to the type of law I’d like to go into. I know it’d be a lot harder than Dutch, but I’m very self-motivated when it comes to languages. While I don’t think I’d pursue Dutch beyond a social level, I imagine I would work to arrive at the C1 level of German past my year abroad. 

A few cons to German: it’d probably take up a lot of my time and be a lot costlier than learning Dutch. As covid hopefully dies down over the year of my degree, I also just want to let myself have time to party and travel around Europe outside of my main studies! 

I am of course also tempted to just try and learn both, but that will probably just doom me to confuse the two, lose my other languages, be broke, and have no free time :)

I would like to learn 🇪🇸 and would like to try this with a bit different approach. I saw a video when a guy moved to Spain to learn the language in 3 months (sure not C1 level in the end). That really inspired me because I think this is the way I would like to get know the culture and the language at the same time, would give me motivation that practice every day and do it daily proactively. Do you know any program which focus on intensive learning that they accept totally beginners (I learnt Spanish at home for a few months, but not enough for A1). I had a concept in my mind like we live together with few other people for a certain period of time, where at least one person speaks Spanish well (preferable native) who is also facilitating the events and discussions in 🇪🇸.

As I am working that's hard to have 3 months of holiday, but I can see the option for having a remote work there. I would like to move there for a few months and start something in this virus period (I know, I know ...)

languagelearning,HelloTalk encourages Youtubers and other influencers to LIE and cover up sponsored content.,"Hi there,

I'm a language Youtuber and I figured that some of you might be interested to know what happened when HelloTalk contacted me to sponsor one my videos the other day. I think this is important for me to share it with you so that you are aware that Hello Talk encourages youtubers to break the law for the sake of advertising their app. Don't be fooled by sponsorships that they try to pass off as simple recommendations.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a thread that I posted on Twitter.

""  Hi #HelloTalk, you might want to read this 😊.

I am extremely disappointed. And in this thread, I will explain why. It’ll be long but it’ll give you an idea of what CAN happen behind the scenes of YouTube sponsorships and paid ads, at least as far as language learning is concerned. Of course, not all companies work this way so let’s not lump all of them together.

I have been a fan of Hello Talk for a long time, and have met great people thanks to it. I have even spontaneously recommended HelloTalk on my channel in various videos. So of course, I was glad when they approached me by DM to offer me some paid promotions because I would be getting paid to promote an app that I already liked in the first place. But then… 

They asked me to do a 1 min ad insert for £50 in one of my videos. I agreed, shot the ad and sent them the video for review (all good, that’s common practice). In the video I mentioned that it was a sponsored video – because it was. They came back to me and said that they did not want me to say clearly that it was sponsored content but instead that I say it’s a “recommendation” and to simply put some hashtags in the description like #sponsorship.

Essentially what ensued was me responding that I couldn’t because

1) viewers aren’t stupid

2) It’s dishonest

3) It’s a lie by omission

4) And that’s just plain FUCKING ILLEGAL. In the UK at least. 

By law, there needs to be no ambiguity as to whether a content is sponsored or not and the viewer shouldn’t have to look for mentions that it’s an add. It MUST to be obvious.

Saying I’m disappointed at HelloTalk’s business practices would be an understatement. It’s absolutely appalling that such a big company would conduct such poor and illegal business practices. Not trying to be alarmist but they are essentially encouraging content creators like me to engage in illegal activities. I was such a huge fan of HelloTalk and this has put me off from EVER recommending this app to anyone again. It’s great to see how shady some companies are willing to be just for the money, isn’t it? Well HelloTalk, you can keep your money, I’ll keep my integrity.""",1616001291,KevinAbroad,2

Since last summer or so, I've been studying for roughly 1 - 1.5 hours a day. Due to updates in my personal life, I can (and want to) now devote the 4 hours of daily free time I have (weekdays).

Advice for what to add to this new study routine with more time?
---
I am currently about halfway through A2. My current daily study routine is roughly as follows:

* 15-20 minutes of graded reading
* 20 minutes of flashcards (writing characters, words I read, CEFR/HSK vocab)
* 10 mins - practice writing characters
* 30 mins - comprehensive exercises from my workbook
* 15 mins - easy videos in Mandarin
* 10 mins - speak dialogues from the workbook

I also have bi-weekly 1-hour tutor sessions and watch all my shows with subtitles.

I realized although I never paid much attention, I could still understand a bit of English song texts and suddenly I was all into learning English. 

Six years later my life contains of speaking my native language at home and at school, but watching all my TV shows in English, talking to everyone on social media in English. It’s like my “secret” English-speaking identity. If I wasn’t so shy I’d probably even still talk to my English friends I met on PS4, but we didn’t speak in a while. 

By now I feel confident enough to say I could easily walk out of this country and start a new life in the USA or UK. I’d honestly love to do so at this point.

Yesterday, Laoshu505000's brother, Mark, released a video on his YouTube channel announcing an independent investigation into the ""Murder of Moses McCormick Aka Laoshu"". Anyone who is a fan knows Moses and his brother had beef over the past year after Moses started dating the new girl seen in all his videos. You are more than welcome to sift through the hours of content from both sides to make your judgement, but here are some facts and considerations that have come out since his death:

1) Mark discusses seeing Moses' body post-mortem, claiming the ""condition"" was not from a heart attack.

2)Moses' Indonesian teacher shared a voicemail she received from Moses' new fiance the day after he past. Something that some people have viewed as quite odd. It is yet to be confirmed if similar messages were sent to other teachers.

3)There have been reports of censorship in the comments of videos on the laoshu505000 channel. Comments discussing Mark's video response to the situation are being actively deleted. 

4)Some people are claiming laoshu's courses are still being sold and that his fiance now has control over his Twitter and youtube. There is no clear answer at this time who has control over his media accounts.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not some linguistic or anthropological expert, but I appreciate the occasional hour-long read about a certain language.

Anyway, this leads me to always thinking about which languages I want to learn, and sometimes it changes because the reasons aren’t necessarily super important.

For example, in the future I think I would like to learn Turkish because a lot of people say Turkey is a great, unique country with a lot of history and very beautiful people (if you’ve ever seen a Turkish woman you know what I mean, haha!).Also the whole vowel harmony thing seems neat.

Another would be Hindi because of the massive amount of media that would be available to me, and also India has a very unique culture. Or Russian because the grammar seems like a great challenge with a lot of resources and and there are a lot of speakers in the US.

When we first started dating I took the time to learn the alphabet and some basic words but then I got so overwhelmed and discouraged. I then stayed with him just as the pandemic was starting last year and ending up staying here for the last 12 months. I thought that being in the country for this long would help me at least have the basics down and be able to semi understand a conversation. But nope. I know I should of tried harder and kept studying but I've been dealing with depression and anxiety and that's been messing with my memory so I have no confidence with learning.

Now I feel like I have to secretly learn the language now. My boyfriend knows I can't speak it but I think he assumes I know words/phrases more than I actually do. Now I would feel so ashamed to ask him to teach me because he'd realise how little I actually know. I feel so stupid and embarrassed and I have no idea how I'm going to teach myself. Even at school I was bad at languages. It just doesn't stick. Sometimes my boyfriend will say something and I'll ask him what that word means and he'll translate it for me. Then in my head I'll repeat it over and over again to try and get it to stick and then like an hour later I've forgotten it. 

I've tried recommended language apps, flashcards etc. I also have this big grammar book which is completely overwhelming after about the fifth page. It makes me so frustrated and mad at myself and I know being in this mindset will only make it harder to learn.",1615941311,glassfloww,12

But for the past 2ish years or so, I feel like I've been stuck firmly at the intermediate level. I take some classes entirely in Spanish, can have conversations (with imperfect grammar), and give presentations on topics about political issues (once did one on the presidential crisis in Venezuela). It's so frustrating because it feels like I haven't been making any ground, unlike my first year in university when I started feeling like I was improving very rapidly. And yet, it can feel so demoralising to do things like try to listen to YouTube vlogs or podcasts or even political news and have to really strain to understand much of it or sometimes just not understand big chunks! I'm not sure what to do, and at times it gets really demoralising and I wonder if I'll ever be able to be proficient in this language and feel like I can live in it and enjoy the world through it—I have lofty goals of moving to a Spanish speaking country, working in that country, and getting to really experience life there, and I start to worry I'm not capable of reaching that point.

Because when I speak English, I often just use the present tense for everything.

languagelearning,Do you guys have any tips for writing practice if someone’s listening/reading are significantly better due to language immersion without much speaking/writing?,"English is my native language but I’ve been surrounded by fluent Swedish and Persian speakers my entire life. Due to this I can understand Persian and Swedish in both written and spoken form very well (C1 level for both) but I have a bit of trouble when it comes to speaking (mostly in Swedish), and a lot of trouble when it comes to writing (mostly in Persian). I’d say my written Swedish and Persian are around early B1 and early A2 levels respectively.

When it comes to speaking practice, that is pretty easy. I live in Sweden and can speak Swedish with anyone I want, and a have a lot of family members who speak Persian so I can practice with them. But I’m stumped at how I can improve my writing without taking a formal course, which is possible in the future but sadly I don’t have enough time to dedicate to that at the moment.

I’m wondering if there is any service where you receive weekly writing prompts and write a short essay based on the prompt, and for a fee a native or fluent speaker will grade and correct it. And if not, do you guys have any tips on how to improve writing in such a strange situation where one has been immersed in a language for a long time but hasn’t practiced any writing? On the bright side writing Swedish isn’t too bad, but Persian grammar is quite tricky and the writing system is not easy to get used to as a native English speaker. 

I guess one similar example I can think of is when I was growing up in California my school had a lot of kids who were born in the US to Mexican or East Asian parents, but since they were born and raised in the US English was their native language. How would one of these students go about getting their writing skills to the same level as their listening/speaking/reading skills?",1615919069,adamfarhadi,1

I’ve only started learning spanish recently (October/ November 2020) but I can have a basic conversation. I picked it up fairly quickly as both my parents can speak spanish so I’ve heard it through my life (my family are Irish/ English, not Latino or anything like that, they used to live in Spain). 
I was just wondering if this was would be a good route? Has anyone found spanish classes at university helpful as a beginner learner? 
I’ve been doing italki classes, and having calls with Colombians as I like that accent and have found it to be helpful, but I’m just wondering if the uni lesson route could be beneficial for me.
Or would it be more beneficial to stick with WhatsApp calls and italki lessons with Latinos due to my preference for that dialect and thus keep it as it is

languagelearning,Ways to Language Learn With a Busy Schedule?,"I'm a junior in highschool (which if you are not from the U.S. is regarded as the most important year in highschool as it's the first year most colleges look at), and I'm trying to learn Italian. I love the language, and have attempted to learn it since I intend to study/teach abroad during and after I attend college. However, with my current schedule of attending school, practices, work, etc; I find myself with very little time to actually study. I was hoping some of you may have some advice?

To give a little information, a typical day for me consists of:

7:00 am-wake up

7:40 am- school begins

11:44 am-school ends

11:44-2:30 pm-eat lunch and do homework

2:30-4:30pm-sports practice

4:30-5:45pm-eat dinner and get ready for work

6:00-10:00pm-work

11:00/12:00 am-sleep

By the time I arrive home at 10:15, I essentially finish up whatever homework I may have, shower, and fall asleep to get a little more than 7 hours of sleep. I guess what I am asking is, if I have no time to actually study, could listening to podcasts/completing duolingo lessons actually help? I don't want to quit learning altogether, but I just don't know where or how I can seriously sit down and dedicate time to learning the intricacies of the language at this point. I guess I also feel really guilty for feeling this way, especially because I know so many people on this sub-reddit are extremely busy too, and they don't let their schedules become an excuse for them.

languagelearning,Want to learn a language to hear what people are saying about me,"   So me (24m) just started a new job at a warehouse and everyone is Romanian, atleast 90% of them. I have only made one friend that can actually speak English, a British dude who just left. 
   
    My parents are immigrants and built everything they have so I've always supported letting people into the country and never understood some of the arguements of people that are against immigration. However this job has given me understanding on why people think like this, because none of the people at work speak English, (and if they do, not that well) I find myself not being part of the work meetings, not having anyone show me what to do just expected to learn and most of the time when I go to speak to someone or someone speaks to me they expect Romanian and almost look dissapoint that I don't speak the language as if that was a requirement in England. Its to the point where the posters and signs like 'fire exit' are in Romanian. 

    Now don't get me wrong, I'm still a valid supporter of immigrants, I think in a few hundred years we're all going to be mixed anyway plus they're usually hard working and I have seen from experiences that they are willing to take any job, their main prioroty is usually to secure money and provide for family, so they do what has to be done, I've seen some Brits in the same situation with none of the work ethic, with pride that stops them from working the necessary jobs and with the opportunity to just go on wealthfare. 

   The situation is just irritating, I feel myself getting angry and having stupid irrational thoughts. And this all probably has a lot to do with the fact that this is my second job so I'm already tired when I get there and I've stopped smoking recently so I'm very on edge but still the major problem came the last shift I worked, I was loading a truck with some of the younger staff (around my age) and it was one of those things, I may not understand the words you're saying but I understand what's happening, they were laughing and making jokes and my sense was telling me I was the reason, it was the way they would saying something when I would do an action, or when they would tell me to do something by pointing and I could just tell it was about me. 

    So I want to learn Romanian, I know its probably petty to learn a language to have that great moment of revenge the next time they talk about me but that's not all, my roommates at university were Romanian so it feels like a sign, after dropping out of university (just before lockdown started) I've been self developing myself towards my goals and my life plan and learning a language is a big part of that. The probablem is, I need someone to speak too, I've downloaded Duolingo and it's great but I want someone I can message and call and pick me up on my dialect, I don't really have time or money for tutor (because of my two jobs and paying off debt) and my last year of uni before I dropped out was kinda hectic, mental health problems, drug issues, loneliness, depression and I pushed away my Romanian friends. I'm doing much better now, it's weird how covid has been a massive screw up for alot of people's lives but helped fix mine but I still  would rather not tell my Romanian friends stuff that happened, I'm just not there yet so I don't want to message them (plus since then none of them have messaged me.)

languagelearning,What is going on with my German and French?,"Hello everyone!

For a bit of context to make it clear later on when i start my rant: I am from England, and have lived here my entire life and speak English as my first language. German is my 2nd language and French is my 3rd language (Russian is my 4th but thats irrelevant here). 

So the rant begins: Basically, ive been learning both German and French for 7 years since I began school and learning these two languages. Still to this day, i continue to learn these languages but through self study which I love since I have more freedom about what I want to cover. Id say both my German and French are at a good solid intermediate level. 

Recently, Ive been talking to native German and native French speakers and doing voice calls via discord with them, since I really want to improve these languages and become fluent in them since I want to move to Germany in the future to live and work as a foreign language teacher for English, French and Russian. Anyway, recently, I was told by a German that apparently my German sounds like im French and not English!! WTF?, okay. I was a little surprised but came to like that idea, since i could fool people haha. 

Then a few days later, I was speaking with a French person, who commented that my French sounded like I was German (or from Alasce-Lorraine at the very least). Since then ive been wondering What on earth is going on with my German and French?. Why dont i sound English?. Although, I love the idea, Im a bit shocked tbh and wanna know why. I didnt even think I was any good at French haha.

languagelearning,"""Loving the culture"" isn't the only good reason to study a language","I recently had a conversation with another American who, wanting to know more about how I ended up living and working as a translator in Germany, asked me when my fascination with German culture started. 

I didn't have an answer for him, because I'm not and never have been *fascinated* with German culture.  Now that I've spent several years here, I have developed an appreciation for German culture and have learned quite a bit about it. But it certainly wasn't my love of German culture that motivated me to memorize vocabulary. 

This is not the only time someone has assumed this about me. My parents friends all seem to be under the impression that I just loved German culture so much that I decided to move to Germany -- even though this simply isn't the case.

There is an idea out there (especially among native English speakers) that love of a foreign culture is the only reason anyone would willingly learn a foreign language. While that certainly is a legitimate reason to study a language, I don't even think you have to particularly like a culture to study its language to an advanced level. 

Part of me wonders if this idea isn't a bit patronizing (""Isn't it just *fascinating* how *different* those people are??""). Another part of me wonders if this assumption does a disservice to different sorts students who might actually really enjoy and excel at language learning, but lack a passion for cultural studies.

Off the top of my head, here are a few skills and motivations that have nothing to do with cultural fascination that can take someone really far in their study of a foreign language: 

* **Social** \- Knowing people who speak this language and the promise of communicating with them in it motivates you. 
* **Analytical** \- You excel in understanding how building blocks come together to comprise a logical whole (i.e. grammar) 
* **Media** \- You are motivated by the promise of consuming certain media in the language. 
* **Problem solving** \- You excel at tasks in which you have a specific goal and a limited toolset with which to achieve it (i.e. figuring out how to express yourself with a limited vocabulary)
* **Critical thinking** \- You excel in tasks in which you need to deduce conclusions based on observations (i.e. using context clues to aid comprehension)
* **Creative** \- You enjoy expanding the mediums through which you can express yourself

What motivates you to study foreign languages? And which skills have helped you in your studies?",1615839678,BralessWunder,168

languagelearning,A Project in Commemoration of Laoshu505000,"Hello everyone. As I'm sure many of us have heard by now, Laoshu505000 (Moses McCormick) passed away from a heart attack at age 39 on March 4, 2021. Despite his short time with us, Moses was an inspiration to many of us in the language learning community, and we mourn the loss of such a great man. Not only did he share his passion for language learning with millions of people, but he demonstrated that despite how different our cultures may be from one another, we're all still human and are able to find connections regardless of our backgrounds.

There has been talk about what can be done in the language learning community to honor Moses, and I've given it quite a bit of thought myself. Whenever I find myself unmotivated to learn a language, Moses' videos give me inspiration to strive through and continue my language learning journey despite the hardships. I'm sure that I'm not alone in this regard, and many of us feel the same way.

While it may not seem like much, I've started to work on a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OfiZJTWB8cA2OOZEQpqZfOdYGzm81HA8U3BPA2TyA_U/edit?usp=sharing) to organize his videos by the languages that he speaks in them. Many people could find this useful for gaining motivation, taking notes, or simply being entertained by Moses even after his passing. However, I'm just one person, and Moses has literally thousands of videos uploaded to his YouTube channel. As such, I wanted to request the help of this subreddit to put together this document, which will be made public. All that is needed from participants is a basic understanding of Microsoft Excel.

If you do consider partaking in this project, please contact me through a comment on this post, or a message on Discord (Apolotion#4575). I plan to make a group chat on Discord, where we can work on this project in an organized manner.

languagelearning,"Developing a crowd-sourced graded-reader web app (Readlang/LingQ-esque), looking for feedback on the concept and potential features","I've spent the past few months developing a website that essentially serves as a reader for user-generated, graded, foreign-language texts (similar to [Readlang](https://readlang.com) or [LingQ](https://lingq.com)). Users contribute graded readers in multiple languages.

However, I'm losing motivation due to being unsure how the features will be received on launch and how to make the site unique. So, I'm looking for and will pay back feedback.

I'd be happy to provide free lifetime access to the site for detailed comments and thoughts since completion is becoming a real struggle as I start doubting it will be useful/used.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the outline of my website so far:

Users can write a story in a number of languages using an advanced editor that displays the most frequently used words, lexical difficulty, and current CEFR level, among others. Publishing - whether private or public - can then occur, with further searching by text level and genre to be read by other learners.

Texts are stored in a user's library. When they open it, a book-like user interface is presented, with extensive ability to change the font, font size, etc. Tap-to-translate and select-to-translate are supported using the Google Translate API.

So far, sounds pretty similar to Readlang and LingQ, right? I wasn't actually aware of these until some time *after* I started the project, and told myself that my unique method of writing up the reader set this website apart. Other unique, planned features that I have thought may set this site apart include:

* collaboration on stories
   * possible ""partner up"" with another learner, writing stories in your target language for each other - this would increase the library of texts and build connections
* translation of stories (they can then be viewed side-by-side as parallel texts)
   * Extension of stories as well (rewrite other people's stories or extend them)
   * Writing up ""chapter questions"" for stories in the target text, which can serve as discussion points with a tutor, friends, comprehension check, etc.
* detailed statistics for motivation (including %unknown words per text, a wordlist, and list of keywords for study)
* exporting for flashcards
* earn premium (more translations, statistic history, etc.) by writing/translating/correcting stories.

I still feel these features are ""weak"", for lack of a better word (they sound useful to me, but I need feedback from a larger group), and the assessment of user contribution too optimistic - I fear the site may be done but the library empty. Sites such as LingQ bypass this by having very limited policing of user content, meaning there is a high volume but significant parts of it infringe on copyright or are blatant piracy. While increasing library size and easier for the users, it's a legal gray area that I don't feel comfortable going into, especially as original, user-created content is being rewarded with premium.

So my questions for you are: **would you use such a site?** What major features would you like to see that could make it unique? and general thoughts on the concept and planned features outlined above.

Thanks in advance. I hope that the feedback I get here will allow me to make this site better for language learners and encourage me to finish by finding a Unique Selling Point/features that distinguish the app from other longstanding similar sites. As stated before, I'd be more than happy to give those who respond free access ~~if~~ when (if this post is a success) for invaluable feedback and suggestions.

I have some pictures I can send to those who are interested if DM or comment, this post just already got longer than expected. 

**TL; DR**

Creating a site similar to Readlang and LingQ. This time around, there's a heavy focus on writing - you can translate, extend, and collaborate on ""graded readers""/stories that are easy to write according to CEFR levels.

But, struggling to come up with reasons for *why* users would bother to write stories, as well as whether the points outlined as bullet points some way up (in addition to writing) distinguish it enough from competition to make it a site that users would actually use/switch to, and not just a waste of months of programming time.

I'll be very thankful and send free full access down the line for thoughts on the uniqueness/chance of success for the site, and especially ideas for new features that could make it unique and useful.",1615837956,LAcuber,8

I'm a native italian speaker and I'm having a really hard time learning about the use of ''se lo/se la/se los/se las''.

Spanish -&gt; Zapatillas -&gt; sí las ata (...would it be like this? With ''sí'' instead of ''se''? And is ''las'' right?).

So I have all the tools I need to learn new vocabulary both from listening to native content or by reading books. However, I don't have the opportunity to speak Arabic naturally in my environment. I have online friends that I talk to extensively everyday but we all speak English to the point that we're essentially bilingual so we'll often inevitably slip back into English, as it makes our conversations flow much better. we're not just language partners, after all.

Now, my question is: how do I get myself to take advantage of those few moments were I get to have a conversation in Arabic to actually use the passive vocabulary I have? I want to be more articulate, and express myself more accurately or more efficiently, but whenever I start speaking, I always feel like I fall back on the same generic words, and I can't come up with more specific verbs and adjectives to describe things and situations in a more accurate and expressive way. However, whenever I practice out loud by myself, I don't have a problem coming up with more advanced vocab. What is that all about??

languagelearning,Please stop comparing your language skills to people who grew up speaking it,"
I feel like I’ve seen so many people on here and also in real life, who get demoralized and depressed that they can’t speak their target language as well as a native. Or... bilingual speakers who learned that TL from childhood.

No matter what way you learned a language, if it worked then that’s great. But I feel like many people on here who started learning a language as a teenager or an adult are not accounting for the luck, years, and circumstances that speakers of multiple languages had. 

If you started learning Spanish, you are not in the same position as a Spanish/English speaker who grew up with a Spanish speaking family in the USA for example.

They had probably a decade or two ahead of you with constant input and output of BOTH languages. Of course they’re going to be better than you, they are bilingual by time and luck. 

They didn’t have to sit down with a teacher. Or study from a book and flashcards like you as a complete beginner, it’s a completely different experience. 

Not only are you having to learn a foreign language, you’re having to learn HOW to learn a language. This is not something natives have ever needed to consciously do. 

And please don’t beat yourself up about not having great pronunciation or grammar like natives. A native, once again, is someone who had long term exposure to the language and luck. 
Their ears are tuned to the sounds of the language they were exposed to, so they can produce it far better than you would and will not make mistakes
.


When people tell me that they feel bad that their English is not good like mine, I tell them the simple fact that, I was born in the USA and I didn’t work hard to know English. I got lucky and grew up without the sweat and tears of trying to learn grammar rules or sentence structure. 

I just lived my life but now here I am, struggling to learn other foreign languages because... guess what? My growing up as a native English speaker did not give me any sort of help with trying to learn someone else’s language.
And this is because I didn’t work for my native language, I didn’t have to try like you are. 


And the fact that you’re out here texting natives in this foreign language, trying to communicate, rewiring your brain, remembering foreign symbols or hundreds of verb conjugations...

This is an incredible feat and you are amazing. Your hard work, your dedication, your sacrifices and your vulnerability, is something that natives can never hold a candle to.

It's still my target, and it holds personal significance what with being significant heritage-wise and correlating with my goal of eventually becoming a translator or using the language in some fashion as a career.  
I've been told that I can afford to -- and should -- take a bit of a step back for a bit. I'll be using this time to decompress and learn about the language more passively, as well as working out a better routine and method(s) of studying so I can (hopefully) approach things from a better, healthier angle.  


In the meantime, I've been eyeing Chinese. Korean's vibe when starting out is like ""You better savor your time, for the grammar shitstorm is coming,"" while Chinese is just a whole bunch of pronunciation and then memorization-heavy writing/vocab, which is a lot more appealing since Korean being the first and main language I'm trying to learn (seriously anyway), the grammar is always hanging over my head. I think Chinese might be a fun way for me to get a less stressful feel for language-learning that won't carry any of the personal baggage Korean has. And doesn't knowing Chinese give you an advantage? Haha

Mixing up vocab, too. *Fest* for *fast*, *seit* for *zeit*, etc.

Daily study routine generally looks like this:


1. 30ish - 60ish minutes of Duolingo (on the high side if I'm using it to help review a grammatical concept ex: modal verbs)


2. 30ish - 45ish minutes of some type of grammar review and drill. Using Schaum's right now. I take notes on the grammatical concept, then write the exercises into my notebook instead of doing them directly in the workbook itself.


3. 15ish - 30ish minutes of reading an easy reader, writing, or watching a simple show in German with German subtitles.


The original plan was to slowly siphon the Duolingo time into the reading/writing/listening time, but now I don't know.


On a bad day, it might just be 20 minutes of Duolingo and 15ish minutes of Schaum's. I'd say the good days have outweighed the bad ones thus far.",1615766273,Sure-Fold,18

languagelearning,Colossally stressed right after starting. Advice?,"Hi.  


I'm in my early teens and just got started back learning Korean after a variety of couple-day stints learning Hangul spanning the course of about a year. My new record? Around 5 out of 7 days. I've been going at it, but now is, as pitiful as it sounds, the peak of the stress this has induced.  


I wanted to start learning Korean as a heritage thing. My grandmother allowed me to grow up close to and quite fond of Korean culture, and I made a promise to her that I would learn the language (though she always just tells me to do whatever I want to do; she never enforces this or anything) as a way of carrying on that part of our family, since her children didn't show any interest. I had other incentives too, like wanting to eventually talk with my Korean family (who can't speak English) or wanting to vaguely prove myself to my mother that my cultural identity aligning with that part of our family is fine, but that's a whole nother story.  


To put it simply, I just don't know if I can do this. I'm not really used to not being good at things, what with being academically talented. I'm definitely not a hardworking person, as sad as that is to acknowledge. I'm unable to do immersion and classes. All of my pathetic attempts to try self-studying or doing such and such for a couple days at best and it seems like nothing works, and I'm only on the alphabet. The content isn't very difficult or anything being that it's only Hangul, but every time I have to do it I just want to get away and do something else. I feel like I've just made it a big chore for myself, and it sure feels like that.  


But in a huge dramatic plot-twist, it obviously isn't that simple. Because if it was, I would've just stopped learning, right? Yeah. But now I always find myself constantly thinking about it. I'm super interested in language learning. I like looking at other languages too, though Korean is the big one with a lot of personal significance. I want to be a translator one day, or a language analyst, who can use that as a job. It's sorta dominated my headspace for awhile now, but every time I try to actually learn, something just keeps pulling me away and makes me mysteriously miserable whenever I do. And the fact that I can't commit to it or even get past a week makes it leagues worse, which is further demotivating. I just wish I could commit and enjoy it, but I don't know why I can't. I get so stoked and excited and motivated (foreign language are one of the most interesting and fun things in the world to me), but then in learning them, it seems like there's just some sort of switch or synapse that never flips or fires. I always dream of being fluent and being able to do all kinds of cool things with Korean, and even other languages, and I always try to ground myself in knowing that it takes time and effort (Especially with the languages I choose. If I had the drive to learn Spanish or Dutch or something, I wouldn't be doing this), but it's like every time I try to take any steps on the path to that, the yellow bricks turn to red-hot coals.

languagelearning,plight of Americans &amp; Anglophones; lack of motivations beyond aesthetic ideals,"The ability to speak a foreign language is inherently attractive. It is immediately indicative to a correlate of intellect, openness to experience, perserverence or grit, and so on. It is a litmus test of general aptitude. 

If you visit a website such as Indeed, and search for all foreign languages,  the only language to return beyond ~5,000 listings is Spanish, and this is all for a wide range of occupations, so you only have a small fraction of these available to you, relative to your qualifications. A general, quantifiable benefit to your career does not appear to be a reason to learn a foreign language. Acquiring other skills are of greater importance, even improving your English is almost certainly so.

To be sure, I would not doubt that mentioning utility in language acquisition will leave a significant population disgusted. Learning for its own sake appears to have taken, though I suspect many people hold this view, ironically, due to its aesthetic.

Unless you have an immediate, regular activity which is also immediately enriched by acquiring a foreign language, then why does an American or other Anglophone learn a foreign language? We all want to improve our ability to attract potential mates. Is it right or wrong to learn for this purpose? 

People don't seem to deny that they are learning because they think speaking a foreign language is ""cool"".",1615741124,AidePast,25

languagelearning,Need Some Help With Bulgarian Dimunitives,"Good day,

I have an OC whose name is Anastasiy (His full name is both a mix of French and Bulgarian, so it's rather long :p) and he's named after his late older sister (Anastasiya). In the story, he only allows the ones closest to him to call him 'Anya', and he does not mind that it is a feminine sounding name. However, recently I found out Bulgarian dimunitives do not work like the Russian ones do. (I heard they do not use -ya or -a at the back?) As someone who loves to learn the names and their meanings in different languages, I felt rather embarrassed that I was not aware of it.

I'd like to know what are some other dimunitives for the name, preferably shorter ones?

languagelearning,"How to curse in Dutch 101 (written by me, a native speaker)","After [u/Bernardes0905](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bernardes0905/) posted on how to curse in Portuguese I thought I might write a post on how to curse in Dutch. Because generally you don't get taught how to swear properly if you follow a language course. And in The Netherlands people do swear a lot. We used to swear a lot on TV too, it was perfectly okay to do so, it was never \*BEEPED\*. But in recent years TV has become a bit more decent... But here we go.

Swearing in Dutch can be broken down into three categories: feces, genitalia and diseases. I will give some examples from each category and tell you how offensive it is considered to be.

**Genitalia**

Genitalia are by far the most popular and widely accepted to swear with. You can use it to signify a person as well (pars pro toto):

* Die *doos* snapt er niets van \[The box doesn't get it\]. Box being a vagina, and thus signifying a woman. This is considered quite mild and non-offensive.
* Die *kut* snapt er niets van. \[The &gt;!cunt !&lt;doens't get it\]. This is rather offensive.
* Hé *pik*, waar ga je heen? \[Hey &gt;!dick!&lt;, where are you going\]. This isn't really offensive and is sometimes used amongst friends.
* Die *lul* staat gewoon te kijken \[That &gt;!prick !&lt;just stands there and watching\]. This is quite mild, just a bit offensive.

Kut &gt;!\[cunt\]!&lt; is probably the most used swear word in Dutch. You use it like &gt;!fuck!&lt; in English. I think it has the same level of offensiveness as &gt;!fuck!&lt; has.

* *KUT!* Ik ben mijn sleutels vergeten \[&gt;!FUCK!&lt;! I forgot my keys\].

But you can use kut in more creative ways as well.

* In compounds:
   * Wat een kutweer! \[Such shitty weather\]
      * You can also say ""hoerenweer"" \[&gt;!whore's!&lt; weather\]
   * Godver, staat die kutstoel weer op de verkeerde plek! \[Damn it, the fucking chair is in the wrong place again\].
* As a verb:
   * Hou op te kutten. \[Stop messing around.\]
* In proverbs:
   * Dat slaat als een kut op een varken. \[Lit: That makes sense like a cunt on a pig.\] Meaning: it doesn't make sense at all.
   * Ik vind er geen kut aan. \[Lit: I don't think a cunt of it\] Meaning: I think it's boring.

**Feces**

This is a rather small category. We don't swear that much with shit or anything and it's really not that offensive to do so.

* Kak/Schijt! \[&gt;!Shit!!&lt;\]
* In compounds, just like kut, but then not really offensive:
   * Schijtweer/Kakweer/Poepweer \[shitty weather\]

**Diseases**

Now this is where Dutch stands out from other languages. We have a  long tradition of swearing with diseases and it can be quite offensive. Some swear words have derived from diseases that were really dangerous in past times but were controlled and are now less offensive. And some aren't even recognized as originating from diseases, because the words have degenerated over the centuries. Those aren't nearly as offensive as you'd think. But the ones that are directly related to current diseases are more offensive. The more serious the disease, the more offensive it is.

Old words:

* *Tering/Tyfus!* \[Tuberculosis/Typhoid fever\]. This can be said like &gt;!Fuck!!&lt; It's not really offensive at all.
* Krijg de *tering*! Vuile *teringleier*! \[Get tuberculosis, you dirty tuberculosis sufferer\]. This sounds harsh, but you could hear this quite commonly for example.
* *Klereleier!* \[Cholera sufferer!\]. This is not so offensive.

Some really offensive ones:

* &gt;!Ach krijg toch bloedkanker achter je hart! \[I hope you get blood cancer behind your hart\]!&lt; Yes... This one isn't pretty and it's very offensive.
* Kanker! \[Cancer!\] Used like &gt;!Fuck!!&lt;
* Wat is het hier een kankerzooi! \[It's a cancer mess around here\]
* Dat is echt kankervet! \[That's &gt;!fucking!&lt; awesome!\]

Or just put everything into one offensive mess:

* Schijtgloeiendekankergodverdomme! \[Shit glowing cancer god damn it!\]

I'm actually doubtful whether I should post this at all, because it can be so offensive that I wish people would stop using these swear words. Especially the ones with cancer... But basically if you'd hear the things people shout when they get road rage, it would involve people wishing each other the worst possible disease they can think of...

So yeah, we swear a lot here in The Netherlands. And we will probably start hearing people using ""Coronaleier!"" sometime next year or so.",1615732750,MJvdN,50

Today at 3PM GMT (1 hour and 20 minutes from now) we offer a live lesson (free) in our Discord server for the Gothic language. For this we use a special lessons method. It will be around 30 minutes as a first introductory lesson but we might have longer ones in the future as we cover more complex aspects of the language.

Gothic is an ancient Germanic language which was spoken by the Visigoths which sacked Rome, the language has some resemblence in certain aspects to modern English and also to German, while it also helps to understand the development of Germanic languages. The language is attested by the Codex Argenteus, a 6th century Bible.

I'm 21 and a couple of years ago I started learning languages I was interested in.
I was very motivated at the time kinda idealizing the target country.
However it's been almost 3 years I'm living in a foreign country as a student.
and as you can guess that's idealized picture was not what the real world is like haha.
So even though I am immersed in the language I am not motivated to learn more or to learn other languages either although I see myself very capable of learning languages.
I used to be very interested in languages , very excited.
But nowadays whenever I want to try to learn more I keep remembering all the not-so-nice people I have interacted with. (It's maybe due to my insecurities as well) 
Either way I am not in the mood for learning languages for more than a year now.
however when I was at high school I couldn't wait to wake up and open my French book to learn more and more see what's going to be next.
I need that excitement again because there are 3 languages that I already know a bit and can perfect.

languagelearning,Issues with Forvo,"Noticed a (bad) change last night, want to see if you also have this issue:

In the past, when you typed a word in the search box, like ""book,"" a drop down would appear with various entries with ""book,"" including sentences, such as ""I have a new book.""

Starting yesterday, if you type ""book"" in the search box, you get only ""book.""

If you click on one of the pronunciations and scroll down, you  will see phrases with ""book"" in them, and you have to click twice to get to that phrase.  

The problem is if the person who recorded ""I have a new book"" did not also record ""book,"" you will never see that sentence.  The only way to find it is to type it, exactly as written, in the search box.  For that you'd need a crystal ball, to know what sentences have been recorded.

Bottom line: if this change is correct as I am seeing it, Forvo just lost 90% of its appeal for me.  I try to use only sentences, and now it's much harder, if not impossible to find them.

Anyone else seeing this, or is it just me?  I tried two different browsers, ad blocker on &amp; off, incognito mode on &amp; off, and still saw the same thing.  Actually, with the ad blocker on it was worse: I couldn't get to the sentences listed below the single word.",1615713899,JS1755,3

So I've been into korean media for years, I'm a bit familiar with the language but I've never tried actually learning it until recently. I've been learning it for the past 2 weeks and I got curious about where I'm at in terms of progress, so I took the Level Test in the Talk To Me In Korean website.

The first half of the test was pretty easy, but the second half gave me a hard time. There were a ton of questions that I didn't fully understand, but I just guessed the answers based on the words that I do know and how they fit in the context, and I got most of them right. 

The test placed me on level 7 (out of 10 levels) and imo it overestimated my capabilities by far since I took a look at the courses for the levels below &amp; there were a lot of concepts that although I'm pretty familiar with, I'm still far from mastering them.

This also happened before with another korean proficiency test from a different app so my question is, how to take those tests in a way that will give you the most accurate result? If there are questions in the test I'm unsure of, should I just answer with ""I don't know"" or is it ok to make educated guesses?",1615702598,onibugi,5

A bit about me: My linguistic background is in French - I am from New England and spoke it very well in high school although since graduating I have definitely let my skills get rusty.

Though I've always been comfortable speaking English, its reached a point where I feel that I can express myself way more effortlessly (especially in writing) compared to Turkish. 

At first I attributed this to the amount of academic writing I've had to do in English compared to Turkish, but lately I've been noticing not only stagnation but a gradual decline in my ability to express thoughts and discuss complex issues when speaking in Turkish. 

I unintentionally blurt out English words way too often and struggle to find the Turkish equivalent of simple words I'll be thinking of in English. I dont just feel ashamed, but also afraid that it might end up hurting my social life in Turkey.

languagelearning,An essay no one asked for: Language learning apps hurt the language community and discourage potential learners.,"This has been on my mind for a while. Though this post isn't about any one app or program in particular, feel free to relate it to ones you know of. This is a criticism of the industry as a whole, and something I've been very vocal about for a while.

 Listening to the radio, watching TV, or browsing social media inevitably brings you to these. We’ve all heard it before- an app promises fluency to us in three months or less. Potential learners uneducated about the language learning process fall victim to this quick-fix language scam, and end out disheartened when their promised three-month fluency never arrives.. This marketing tactic is seen in applications like the ever-popular Duolingo, Memrise, Drops, and Babbel, to name just a few. 

Linguiphiles passionate about language learning and linguistics look down on the promise of such easy fluency as playing a game for fifteen minutes. To an outsider it appears simply pretentious gatekeeping of language learning, but it is very worth examining the effect of these quick-fix language programs on the language community, and most importantly for our purposes, on the perception of multilingualism as a whole. It is, first, the lack of globalization in education that gives rise to this industry of empty promises of fluency. Having not learned the language learning process at an early age, people fall for schemes like this, become put-out by their supposed inability to retain a language in that *egregiously* understated amount of time, and thus, the learning community suffers in terms of declining numbers. 

This also affects the perception of multilingualism as a thing only to be attained by the most smart or elite of our society, which is certainly not the case. Quick-fix language apps and programs promise high-level language mastery within months, and when people don’t reach this unrealistic goal, the community suffers.  This becomes especially troubling if you live in a region like America, where globalized education is shunned, and an archaic America First agenda is pushed above all else. Giving no access to language classes or resources *other* than these apps.

An entire, very profitable industry has been built on lies and deceit. It is said often in this sub and the larger language community as a whole that places like Duolingo are a good *start*, but not the end-all be-all of language learning and retention. To outsiders, however, who aren't active participants in the language learning circle, marketing for these applications is scarily effective, and manages to convince a demographic of monolinguals that C1 and above is attainable with a matching game alone! 

It's worth noting, additionally, quality education outside of a public school environment is, often, very expensive. America, of course, has exorbitant college tuition prices that stunt language progression, and progression in any other learnable skill. Dedicating time to language learning is difficult, of course. And language textbooks, tutors, and things of the sort aren't readily available to a lot of people. The failing of our culture to educate people about the process of learning a language (especially how long it takes) we've bred a society where an industry like this can become a lucrative scheme. 

There is, of course, still people who understand this and move on to other learning resources after their tenure at Memrise University is finished, but I'm inclined to say that must be a very small amount of people in proportion to those that don't. 

So, conclusion of the essay no one asked for TM. I'm not trying to gatekeep or be snobby. Fact of the matter is, this inadvertently hurts the community we love. Language is my biggest passion in life. So seeing the amazing journey of learning be bastardized by phone apps teaching you to parrot stock phrases makes me sad, and yes, very angry. People do what they want with their time, I acknowledge, but an effort should be made to inform the masses that, ""Hey, you will never be fluent in three months playing a game, here are some better resources.""

languagelearning,Starting a third language while trying to perfect your second,"I am American and I grew up only speaking English. In 7th grade I started learning French, which I continued through high school and college. French was my second major in college. I even spent a year abroad in France as a junior in college. I haven’t taken the official test in a while, but I believe I am around level B2/C1. I recently earned my French teaching credential and it is my dream to teach high school French (I am currently an elementary school teacher). 

Even though I speak and understand the language more or less fluently, I still feel like I have so much to learn. I’m always listening to French podcasts and music. I also use the free Kwiziq assessments on Lawless French to practice and refine grammar. I try to speak in French to others  whenever possible, though that is somewhat rare. So I am still actively learning French and I feel like I will never stop.

But part of me really wants to learn Spanish too! It’s very useful since I live in California and many of my students and their families speak Spanish. I also will (hopefully) travel to Mexico in 2022. It makes sense for me to learn Spanish and it’s something I’ve wanted to do for a while.

For some reason, however, I have this hang up that I can’t start learning Spanish until I feel I’ve mastered French. Like I said, perfecting French will likely be a life long process for me, so I don’t really anticipate ever feeling like I’ve truly mastered it. I’ve also thought that I can wait until I’ve been hired as a French teacher to start learning Spanish. But I think I should just start.

Does anyone else find themselves in this position? I think I just need to have a strict schedule where I spend a certain amount of time per day perfecting French and some amount of time diving into Spanish. My fear is that I will confused them. Or that I will lose the progress I’ve made in French by starting a new language. 

I think my fears come from being a monolingual English speaking until the age of 12 and then zeroing in on learning French for over a decade. I know that this is probably a uniquely American issue since in many countries/cultures, folks are learning or already know 2 or more languages.

I would love to hear if others find themselves in this situation! And how you balance refining one language while learning a new language completely from scratch.",1615662593,sara_n_wrap,7

languagelearning,Learn Language While Travelling,"Hey guys - being a native Spanish speaker and also speaking Portuguese, French and English, I found that for me what it worked better was to learn languages in the country directly. For example, when I learnt French, I moved to France for 3 years. Originally, 6 months but it ended up to be 3 years (studying and working). The same thing with English and the UK... and Portuguese and Brazil. However, my recommendation for any new learner:

**1) Leave your fear behind**. 💪  We all make mistakes and feel embarrassed to speak in front of other people initially but this doesn't help. Just acknowledge that we're all starting from somewhere at some point and things will work fine.

**2) Books are good but careful**. 📚  Don't spend too much time learning vocabulary or try to be the king/queen of the phonetic transcription. Grammar is very important and foundations are key, this is a fact but there's a certain point when listening to music/radio/podcasts, watching films, reading news/magazines in the language you're trying to learn will complement it.

**3) It's not the language itself. 🧠**  Immerse yourself in the local culture and customs too. Understanding how locals thinks will complement and accelerate your language skills.

**4) Be curious**. 👀  Don't judge why they eat in a certain way, why grammar is that way or why they do certain things. Every new language is a new vision of the world.

**5) Travel.** 🧭  From my perspective this is the game changer. If travel is an option and we can learn in the local country, then this should be the starting point. I cannot stress how much this accelerates and enriches the whole learning process. I lived in Argentina, Brazil, France and currently in the UK and learning locally is so powerful.

I know these are very basic and perhaps obvious tips but they really worked for me. Hope this helps at least one person and feel free to be in touch if you love languages/travel. I love making videos and writing about languages/travel because I believe that this is another way to explore and understand life. 🙏",1615650712,alesalvino,13

languagelearning,"How to Swear in Uzbek Russian 101 (written by me, a native speaker. Part 1)","Inspired by the guy who wrote how to swear in Portuguese. Now it's my turn.

Let it be known that in spite of Uzbek there's still an impressive amount of people speaking Russian; of course, we have a great deal of words to go with.

Let's start with something you quite disagree,  and find it quite idiotic and shameful. If this action is done by a girl, you say ""uyat"" which is a literal borrowing from Uzbek, meaning ""shame"". It became popular when our politicians tried to put local feminists to shame. 

The word isn't really that strong but let's keep going. We have ""sharmanda"" which is ""shame"" too but you use it, for example, to shame someone for being ""licentious"" in Uzbek perspective — let's consider the following situations in an Uzbek family:

— You don't go married at young age or have kids! Uyat va sharmanda!

— You don't wanna pay a bribe? That's regretful, absolutely, but just uyat.

— You don't wanna do what your idiotic mother-in-law says? SHARMANDA

You also use ""uyat va sharmanda"" ironically. As I do. 

Let's say you're taken aback, confused because your meeting, arrangements and planned stuff are falling through or getting off. 

You'd say either ""pizdets"" if you are not enough surprised and kinda it wasn't important to you but it's was PARAMOUNTLY IMPORTANT, URGENT and stuff — you say ""JALYAAAAAB"" (jalab, make a long vowel in the second syllable). 

You, however, can avoid using ""pizdets"" and say ""jalab"" instead but it should not have the long vowel at the end. If you think it's not Russian enough, you say ""blyaaaa pizdets"" which would be the same as ""jalyaab"", you know now. 

Let's say you hit on the wood, got yourself hit into the door or something — you can say ""blyat"" or ""blyaaaa"" if it caused bleeding or some bad consequences. 

You also say ""blyaaa"" if everything went wrong — let's say, your Texas city comes up against a shoutdown, or you're approaching the deadlines but nothing is done yet, what you say? You say ""blyaaa"", ofc. 

Let's learn ""zayebus' + infinitive"" structure. It means ""I'm going to be buggered while doing something"" — 

""I'll be buggered if I do it"" — ya zayebus' yesli eto budu delac ya (I'll be buggered if this will do I)

""Khuy sasuy"" means 'get fucked, bitch. I'm not gonna do it"" (literally equivalent to SUCK DICK). If you feel bad, you say ""khuyovo"", or you think it's done in a very shit way you say ""govnyano"" (shitly), ""khuynya"" (dick-y)

languagelearning,"Can't decide between studying German or Arabic, any help is much appreciated!","So I started learning German in school age 12, that was 10 years ago and since being forced to drop German age 14 before my GCSES I've not managed to find an effective method of studying it again.

So I've basically forgotten everything and would be starting from scratch. I'm really interested in German and the cultures of the DACH region, I like German history etc. The only thing holding me back is losing motivation again and but being able to plow through because the honeymoon period is over.

What sparked my interest in Arabic was a trip to Morocco for my 18th birthday, since then I've become interested in the history and modern relations of the Arab world and Middle-East (e.g. Islamic golden age, Al-Andulus &amp; Arab Spring etc) and the fact that the cultures are so different from my native one (The UK).

The fact that the dialects of Arabic can be so vastly different from eachother and MSA fascinates me. I'm particularly interested in the Gulf dialect because that region interests me.

I'm not saying that once the honeymoon period with Arabic is over I won't lose motivation but I doubt it'll happen as quickly as I know so much less about Arab culture than German.

If you know of any ways I can help myself decide which language to choose I'd greatly appreciate it! What would you choose if you were me? &amp; Why? Thanks!",1615640294,Subs-man,15
languagelearning,How to curse in Spanish from Spain (by an Spaniard),"Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/m3ycti/how_to_curse_in_portuguese_101_written_by_me_a/). I would like to explain to you something about how the art of insulting in Spain works.

First of all I would like to say that although I like English I think that its swear words do not reach the variety and ""beauty"" of other languages such as Spanish or Portuguese. I will give a few examples of the most common insults, their translation into English and moments where they can be used. To say that the insults in Spanish are like Legos, there are infinite combinations, each one better than the previous one.

We will start with the most common Spanish insult in Spain, Joder. Joder can be translated as joder, both of which mean to have sex. Its uses are very similar to those of fuck in English, for example

\- Joder! - Fuck!

\- Mi profesor solo me quiere joder - My teacher just wants to fuck me

\- I'm so fucked up - I'm so fucked up 

\-Jodete - Fuck you

The next insult and probably one of the most common, especially in northern Spain, is Hostia, literally communion bread. Its uses range from exclamations of surprise to giving oneself a blow, some examples of its use:

\-(la) Hostia - Holy shit (As a form of exclamation).

\-Me he dado una hostia - I've given myself a blow

I'm going to give you a blow -Te voy a dar una hostia - I'm going to give you a blow 

\- Esto es la hostia - This is the best

It is necessary to say that the word Hostia is very rude, especially in religious contexts, so Hostia is often replaced by Leche (milk).

Now we come to the wildcard insult. This swear word can stand alone or accompany almost any word. The insult in question is whore, bitch or whore. This slur can be used to disqualify a person or accompanying others to make them stronger, some examples with the previous slur would be:

\- Hostia puta - Holy fucking shit

\- Eres una puta - You're a hore (there is a masculine version changing Puta by Puto)

\- Tu puta madre - The whore of your mother

\- Hijo de puta - Son of a bitch (This one has thousands of variations like ""hijo de mil putas"" - Son of a thousand bitch)

\- Esto es la puta hostia - This is fucking awesome (there is also the version ""Esto esta de puta madre"")

The word Puta has a thousand combinations: ""La puta de oros"" the golden whore (this insult refers to Spanish playing cards) ""La puta que te pario"" the bitch that give birth to you, ""La puta leche"" the fucking shit. As you can see it can be used as a rather rude emphasizer of any word. If you want to pass yourself off as a young Spaniard just implement in your vocabulary ""me puto encanta"" I fucking love it, or ""me puto muero"" I'm fucking diying.

The last ""independent"" term I am going to show you is La virgen, the holy mother, Spain is a country of catholic culture so this kind of terms are both common and offensive, especially towards religious people. This word can be used mainly as an exclamation:

\- La virgen! - Jesus Christ!

Now that you know the words used to insult we come to what makes Spanish so beautiful, ""cagarse en"" shit on. In Spanish this expression in combination with the previous swear words is the most common way to curse. In this type of cursing what is most valued is the imagination with which words are combined. Some of the most common expressions (from the least strong and simple to the most bad and complex) are: 

\-Me cago en la leche - I shit on the milk

Me cago en la mar salada - I shit on the salted sea

Me cago en todo - I shit on everything

\-Me cago en todo lo cagable - I shit on everything that can be shitted

From here come the strongest expressions

\-Me cago en mi calavera - I shit in my skull

\-Me cago en mis muelas - I shit in my tooth

\-Me cago en la puta - I shit on the whore

\-Me cago en mi puta madre - I shit in the whore of my mother

\-Me cago en la leche puta - I shit on the fucking milk

\-Me cago en la puta de oros - I shit in the golden whore

\-Me cago en Dios - I shit in god (Very offensive)

\-Me cago en la virgen - I shit in the holy mother (Very offensive)

\-Me cago en la hostia (puta) - I shit in the Hostia (Very offensive)

\-Me cago en tos' mis/tus muertos - I shit on all my/your dead (Very offensive)

The following three are possibly the most offensive insults in the Spanish language

\-Me cago en tu puta madre - I shit in the whore of your mother

\-Me cago en tu raza - I shit on your race (should never be used as it is extremely racist)

\-Me cago en tu sangre - I shit on your blood (it refers to your bloodline, it is probably the most offensive insult in Spanish along with the previous one).

And finally some examples of the more elaborated versions of this expression

\-Me cago en todos tus muertos y en la farola que ilumina sus tumbas - I shit on all your dead and on the street lamp that illuminates their graves. 

\-Me cago en Dios y tengo suficiente mierda para cagarme en tu puta madre - I shit on God and I have enough shit left over to shit on your fucking mother too.

\-Me cago en tus muertos a caballo - I shit on your dead on horseback

\-Me cago en la leche, Merche - I shit in the milk, Merche (this expression comes from a Spanish series, knowing it will make you look like a connoisseur of Spanish culture)

\-Me cago en los clavos oxidados de la cruz astillada de cristo - I shit in the rusty nails of the splintered cross of christ. - I shit on the rusty nails of Christ's splintered cross.

\-Me cago en tu boca abierta - I shit on your open mouth

\-Me cago en los postes que sujetan las farolas que iluminan la tumba de tu puta madre - I shit on the screws that hold the lamppost that illuminates your fucking mother's grave

Me cago en tus muertos mas frescos e incluso en los acalaveraos. - I shit on your freshest dead and even on the acalaveraos (the most dead).

\-Me cago en el olivo que dio las aceitunas con las que se hizo el aceite con la que se engrasaron los clavos de la cama donde te pario tu puta madre - I shit on the olive tree that gave the olives that were used to make the oil used to grease the nails of the bed where your fucking mother gave birth to you. 

Finally, Spanish is such a beautiful language that you can start a friendship by saying: eres un gilipollas  (you are a fucking asholle) and end it by saying tu eres un listo (you are a clever man). I don't guarantee this will work for you, so don't try it.",1615639534,H_Mex,93

Nothing has really worked as well as simply forgetting all these hacks and just investing myself in the language. Study, in other words. It was quite comical to realise that this was all it took to get better.

I have used many language learning programs like Pimsleur, Busuu in the past, and I am currently still using Assimil, but I just started using Italki to challenge myself further. I didn't want to use it for the longest time because I thought that I would not understand anything, and that it was too expensive. After just 2 sessions, I recommend using it. Speaking with a professional teacher/tutor has been the best thing that i have tried so far because it feels relaxing and natural. My teacher makes me feel extremely comfortable and asks her questions in multiple ways when I get stuck. I feel like I am already mimicking her way of speaking.  I am also fortunate that she allows me to record the lessons since I cannot afford to use italki every day, so I listen to the chats on my days off.

But other than duolingo, is there a good format for the order in which you learn elements of the Greek language? I have a workbook that helps with the alphabet, but I'm already struggling with that. Should I even start listening to the conversational cds and begin learning pronunciation, etc, when I can't even remember what sound a letter of the alphabet makes?

Americans may think their insults are heavy when they see an +18 Hollywood film, but the average thing you hear everyday in Brazilian dialogue is much better.

When you believe something and it's surprising, in English you can only say ""I can't believe it"" and there's not much you can do about it. In Portuguese there's ""essa foi de cair o cu da bunda"" (that makes my butthole fall out of my asscheeks). You aren't just surprised; you're surprised enough to get a prolapse. It's one of my favorite expressions in the language.

Americans have the interjection ""fuck"", which is okay in my book, but in Brazil we have two: ""porra"" (jizz) and ""caralho"" (cock). Depending on the tone of pronunciation, it means something completely different; it can either mean something as in ""fuck, I touched something hot and I burned my finger"" or ""I'm impressed"". ""Pra caralho"" and ""pra porra"" can be used in the same manner as ""as fuck"" in English.

Speaking of the word ""fuck"", there's also a word for copulation in Portuguese: ""foda"". It can hold different meaning upon context. For example, when you describe something or somebody as ""foda"", you're complimenting them. ""Ele é foda"" could be freely translated into ""he's a chad"" or ""he's a boss"". But wait -- if you simply say ""é foda"", like sighing and in a despairing tone, as in a reply to bad news, it changes meaning! It becomes ""it's not easy for anybody"". ""Foda"" can also be employed as in ""this television set is fucked"" (essa televisão está fodida) or even ""nem fodendo"" (not even if I fuck), which is how you say ""no way"" or ""that's not going to happen"". Example: ""nem fodendo que vão concordar com sua oferta."" (no fucking way they are going to agree to your offer.)

There's also ""puta que pariu"", which can be used in several ways. ""Puta que pariu"" means ""the whore who birthed"", and can be an interjection to say as a reaction to something bad happening. Did you get frustrated because you just broke expensive glassware and you have to not only replace it, but clean the mess up? Say ""puta que pariu"", it will make you feel somewhat better. There's also ""vá para a puta que pariu"", which means ""go to wherever your whore mum birthed you"", it's like ""fuck off"" in English but rougher. Saying ""fica lá na puta que pariu"" (it's located over there where the whore gives birth) is to say somewhere is very far away, it's the same as ""it's far as shit"" but the latter isn't nearly as strong.

Now let's say you see somebody driving very badly, and maybe ""puta que pariu"" isn't enough. Sometimes it works, but you could also say ""boçanha"" (aumentative for ""boceta""; pussy, cunt, etc). Sounds even more coarse, I overheard my father saying it when parking his car when I was 10 and I happened to say in school one day, I was some 4th grade boy and the teachers didn't like it and asked me where did I get that vocabulary from. I probably didn't know very well what a vagina was at the time, but I knew straight away what was the point in saying ""boçanha"".

One of Brazil's favorite swear words is ""corno"", meaning ""cuck"" or ""cuckold"". It has different cultural value around here and everybody uses it; it doesn't make you look like alt-right or anything remotely close. There's also a wise proverb from Brazil about infidelity: ""o corno é sempre o último a saber"" (the cuck is always the last man to know).

And a final fun fact: Brazilian men (especially urban heterosexual men) greet and part with their other male friends by cursing them jokingly, it happens when you're quite intimate with said person. I often call my best friend a cuck and he calls me a son of a bitch, I know the bloke for 9 years and he's actually a good lad.",1615607003,Bernardes0905,55

languagelearning,UPDATE: Tigrinya and Advice for Learning Lesser-Known Languages,"Here is my original post asking for advice on learning Tigrinya, a language with relatively few learning materials: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/ljue7k/advice_for_learning_lesserknown_languages_but/)

After taking a while to sort through all the great advice you guys had, I decided to create a plan of action. Following off u/Nekani28's and u/Golden-lion1's advice, I employed my dad's translating abilities, but instead of coming up with the sentences myself, I pulled the short and simple beginner stories available for free on [lingq.com](https://lingq.com). They are all told twice, from two perspectives so you get to see how verbs conjugate in a more natural way. The process has been very helpful so far, I can't recommend this method enough for anyone trying to learn languages that aren't available on many popular language learning websites. 

I also found a copy of Tigrinya Grammar as suggested by u/1bir and it's been really helpful compared to all the Tigrinya to English books I already have. Furthermore, I did find a website with excellent examples of Tigrinya, including audio clips and Ge'ez text: [50 languages](https://www.50languages.com/phrasebook/lesson/en/ti/1/). It's basically a really well-done phrasebook with audio recordings for every word/sentence and it's available in many other under-resourced languages. 

Finally, I wanted to compile all of the helpful Tigrinya resources I possibly could into one place so I made a [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S1mB6l_BKMo6Vl3NcYpootif_ECY5eKO?usp=sharing) where I am putting the translated stories and where I am slowly digitizing some of the physical resources that I have found over the years. Feel free to go over the material if you are interested and add more if you find anything useful. 

Hope all this can help anyone learning Tigrinya or any other small language!",1615602131,dorinodino,1
languagelearning,Ladino and Spanish Comparison,"Does anybody know how close Spanish and Ladino (Judeo-Spanish) are? I would assume they were close but is it like German and Yiddish where they are mostly mutually intelligible aside from religious ideas, or more like English and Yiddish? Technically in the same family but nowhere near mutually intelligible?

I currently speak only English, am semi-fluent in French, and know a few basic words and phrases of Japanese. I am converting to Judaism and have looked pretty heavily into Sephardic minhag and culture, and want to look at studying the language of Sephardic Jewry, that being Ladino. I already know that French and Spanish are about as far apart as two languages can be for being in the same family, and theblatter has a heavy Semetic influence from the Ummayad Caliphate's conquest and later the vestigial remnants of said Caliphate surviving in Al-Andalusia, and the Caliphate of Cordoba. Given this is around the time Spanish, Portugese and Catalan started to come into being, and Ladino alongside them.

I'm attempting to learn Japanese, I recently found interest in language as a whole - which is why I'm wishing to learn one. I also figure learning a language is just, healthy. Good for the brain.

I've only been learning for just over a week, using duolingo. While it works, it's not wonderful. The Japanese course has no speaking - has listening but no way to check if I'm correct, I have a drawing tablet and Japanese keyboard installed so I can practice writing, though I haven't.

Tried busuu, unsure of it yet though. Have a site to find that's like, flash cards for the typography.

Also, I bought Genki 1 &amp; 2 2nd ed. + workbooks. They will be arriving tomorrow.

languagelearning,Found a Mentor Today,"A little background, I am currently enrolled at Arizona State University in an online program.  Due to a scheduling mishap, my Spanish 102 professor had us select Zoom group sessions for the wrong week.  She later shifted the meeting by a week, which completely conflicted with my work schedule as I did not request off for these dates.  After a few e-mails she agreed to do a one-on-one with me today.  

After our session, she said that I showed skills in Spanish above the course I am enrolled.  However, I feel that I need to continue taking the current course to refresh with vocabulary and refamiliarize myself with Spanish a bit more.  In the end, my professor agreed to let me do private sessions with her to increase my language usage faster than being stuck with the groups.  She also invited me to audit her Spanish Lit/Film class.

Not only has my understanding of the language been increased minimally, I've also mentally refused to learn more, no matter how hard I try. I know that me saying this will have no effect on the world, but I truly do think the school language system requires some reworking. learning a second language should be a choice that someone can enjoy, forcing it makes it a begrudging task and associates it with the same negative connotations that mathematics has picked up.

languagelearning,"Love the teacher, hate the books","For the last couple of weeks, I've booked several lessons on iTalki (between one and two hours per week). My main goal was to improve my listening and speaking skills since I don't have many opportunities to do so in real life. Also, I work full time, so my spare time is pretty limited. I genuinely thought learning a language with a teacher would have been much easier and faster. 

The teacher is great. She is motivating, patient, enthusiastic, etc. 

The thing is, I'm not a big fan of the books she uses (which are surprisingly very popular amongst teachers of my TL, particularly on iTalki). These are the typical old-fashioned, monolingual, dry course books for foreigners, with almost no audio, no translation, few texts, and few dialogues. Words are introduced in a list at the beginning of the chapter, without context. Therefore, I would say that those books are maybe not bad, just basic. 

So far, several issues arise from this situation: I spend (outside the class) / We spend (during the class) so much time only to translate words, notably those introduced in a sort of lists at the beginning of every chapter. In my opinion, not having audio and text makes the learning process much more arduous, especially during two lessons. 

I mentioned the idea of using a textbook (like Teach yourself) instead to overcome these downsides, but for some reason, she doesn't like those ""bilingual"" books.

I came across this app (available in both the App Store and the Google Play) called DailyArt that will show you a famous painting and tell you it’s meaning, the story of how it came to be and some interesting fun facts. 

You can set the app in the language you want, there’s a nice variety, and the texts are the perfect length, not too short not too long, so it’s not overwhelming. There’s also a button to translate at the bottom.

Anyways, just thought I’d share for anyone who might be interested, I think it’s a cool idea! Happy learning everybody :)",1615522360,Mt28500,1

languagelearning,Tips on learning and teaching,"Hey, this is going to be a hard question to phrase I guess, but i’ve started meeting online with this russian teacher. The thing is we’re both a little bit lost because as it is not a school or something like that and i’m the only student, which is great because it’s a lot more personalized, but for the same reason it’s a little more difficult to know where to start, also i’ve always studied alone so I don’t really know what’s the best way to do this. So basically, I want some advice on how should we go on, what do you recommend so I can make the most out of those virtual meetings. And also tips like, is it a good idea to watch videos and movies and that stuff, or what’s the best way to study grammar with a teacher, the best way to learn vocabulary, or literally any advice you can give so I make the most of it. Thanks a lot",1615519268,Nnema03,6

languagelearning,"Different languages, different strategies...","""Everyone has different learning styles, find the one that works best for you"" is something we hear a lot around here. And I think it's absolutely true. But here's a problem I'm facing, and since I'm sure I'm not the only one, I'll ask for your wise opinions:

**Different languages might ask for different strategies, but adapting or changing your preferred methods can be hard (for me at least).**

I'm a native Spanish speaker. I've been studying French for a couple of years through the classic path of a classroom class with a teacher and classmates, and complementing with language consumption through literature, radio, movies, etc. Works great, everybody knows it. But through the pandemic I decided to start learning Italian and Russian on my own (not here to discuss whether that's a good idea haha). It's the first time I've tried to learn a language this way. I've loved the experience of doing both at the same time because Italian is basically the easiest language I can learn as a native Spanish speaker, and Russian is the opposite: H.A.R.D. 

I'm the kind of person who actually likes sitting down and studying the grammar and understanding how a language works (the boring stuff) more than trying to be able to have a basic conversation as soon as I possibly can. So with Italian, I am sort of mimicking how I learned French: I'm properly studying the grammar, and kind of just absorbing the rest because it comes easy (dangerously easy in that sometimes you don't make an effort to actively learn the things that you passively understand! haha). For self teaching, this strategy is working well for me.

But with Russian it's a whole different story. It's my first time learning a significantly different language, and I'm realizing my usual strategies are not working as well here. I've tried to guide myself through learning the grammar as usual (and I really do enjoy doing this!), thinking that I'd be able to keep up with increasing my vocabulary and getting familiar with the structure on the way. Instead, I've only slowed down, and not noticed much progress so far. Also, in this case I REALLY miss the active aspect of being in a classroom and having to speak and write constantly. It's really a different story when you actually have to put a lot of effort into learning every single new word, and when the structure is so significantly different.  So I've started to suspect that I would benefit from changing my strategy in this case, but I'm so comfortable in my built system that I don't know how to begin adapting.

**TL;DR** In short, for those of you have learned different languages, have you had to consciously change your methods and strategies between languages, particularly between languages closer to your own, and the very distant and challenging ones? How? What has worked for you? Has it been easy for you to adapt to new learning strategies? Do you have interesting stories about this?",1615508447,aramacao_,14

To be fair I'm probably not gonna travel anytime soon so I plan on focusing on reading, but I hope to travel some day. As far as my reading Im really in awe of German idealism and sociology, I am dazzled by French Literature and postmodern theory, and have a deep fondness to Russian Literature. I guess my question is whether the clear and sober academic writings of say German sociologists, are not more easy to accurately represent in translation into English. If thats the case I would probably hold off on German because I have a sense that this kind of subject is confined to academic ivory towers and it would be rare to find people that read it for fun. On the other hand I definitely feel like I'm missing out on a lot of word play and symbolism and personalities in French and Russian translations into English. But as far as actually having conversations with people I feel like it would be easier for me to make friends in Russia and be able to talk endlessly about literature, history, and politics with mostly anyone.

languagelearning,How to pick up my German again?,"So I’ve been learning German for about 10 years. Yes, that is a very long time but I’m not fully fluent yet, I’m B2 level. I basically learnt at school from the ages of 12-17 starting with classes just once a week in my lower years, then 3/4 times a week (so 3-4 hours plus homework and stuff outside of school) as I got into my later school years and chose it as an optimal subject. Though we had touched on grammar in the lower years, it was in these years that my German really started to pick up as we studied grammar properly, things like cases, tenses, adjective endings, prepositions, etc. I was a straight A student and very talented at reading, writing, listening and speaking.

I didn’t carry German onto university but I had a couple of modules where I studied German texts and in my second year I did take a language module. I also continued to watch tv shows and youtubers in German to help keep up my language. However, I graduated last year and haven’t really touched anything related to German in the past 2 years. /: I really don’t want to lost my German but I feel like I’m starting to forget words and some grammar already.

I posted half a year ago about reaching the 40 language mark so I have made quite good progress over the past couple months. I even finished a 24 hour livestream yesterday where me and my friend made 11 courses in one day! As a quick overview for those who don't know about my project:

**Xefjord's Complete Language Series** is a project I started over a year ago to teach every known living language to a ""survival"" level. Survival level being a term I created to refer to the ability to get by and begin learning the rest of the language using only your target language. My decks teach 200 basic words and phrases handpicked to reach this goal as well as the template for advanced cards that you can expand upon to further progress your study (The Asian language decks also borrow Chinese Character learning decks and put them in my format).

My courses are nothing amazing in terms of the depth of content, you won't be able to watch movies in the language or understand 90% of what is said at you after finishing them. But it does get you to a level where if you know speakers of your target language or are starting a course with a tutor, you have little reason to need to fall back on your native language. As I said the advanced card template is provided (with one to fifty cards of examples depending on the language) for those that want to expand the decks on their own so you can continue to utilize this resource after the beginner level. I have even created a blogpost on my website explaining my method of creating advanced cards step by step.

Over the past few months I have managed to create a lot of new courses for languages big and small and I put a lot of effort and care in working with volunteers to make the courses easy to understand and make sure all the important grammatical subjects (Gender or formality) are being taught, but this project really wouldn't be possible without the wonderful help of everyone who provided translations. I am always accepting more translations for languages not yet covered as well!

So without further adieu, here is the total list of all languages available. Some languages have multiple courses offered (Like Mandarin, Spanish, Vietnamese, Nahuatl, etc), I hope everyone can enjoy them and if anyone notices any mistakes or has any questions you are free to PM me anytime.

languagelearning,What language should I learn?,"I speak Brazilian portuguese, English, and a tad bit of Spanish. Should I become fluent in Spanish before moving on to another language? I find learning Spanish way harder than English, probably because it's so similar to my native language: portuguese.

languagelearning,Help! I can’t pick/focus on one language.,"I am hoping you guys can help. I have been following this community for a long time and you are all so kind and helpful so I am hoping you can help my with my current dilemma. 

I can’t focus/pick one language. I have always wanted to learn Latin but I can’t find good resources. I live in Florida so I feel like a have to learn Spanish and it would be nice to understand people who only speak Spanish but I also love reading and I would love to read many of my favorite French authors in their original/untranslated texts. Any recommendations? Is one language easier than another or would you recommend one over another? I know they are all fairly similar due to them all being Romance languages but I’m still curious. What would you suggest in my situation. Thanks You!",1615494281,SiriusDogLover,10

languagelearning,Movies about Language Learning and Barriers? Needed for Diversity Media Club,"I am in a media club at work that focuses on becoming more socially conscious and aware, so that we can help be a part of the solution in health equity. 

For next month's topic, **we are looking to find a film that focuses on language learning and how language barriers can affect people and communities in their everyday life.**

For example, a film about a family who moves to a new country, and doesn't know anyone there, but has to learn how to navigate every single thing that comes their way.

Thank you!!!

languagelearning,Is there any good apps for learning Russian?,"I want to learn Russian but I cant seem to find an app where I can learn Russian. I'm not taking it 100% serious but I want to learn it anyway. I have tried Duolingo but it didn't really work for me because they taught just words and sentences and not the alphabet. So is there any good apps?

languagelearning,What do you need to become a language teacher?,"Hello! I'm a second semester literature student and the career path I want to pursue is becoming a professor. I was thinking about also studying to become a language teacher (preferably at a university level) since I love languages, I would like to live in different countries and both careers can be related. I would teach my native language or a language in which I'm really proficient at (I guess I still have plenty of time to improve my foreign language skills, but the ones I like are Korean and French).

But I don't really know what should I study along with my literature degree, do you have some ideas?",1615485767,BashfulJasmine,4

But my problem is that even tho I can talk with people, I also have some stupid problems with grammar. 
I do not make huge mistakes that makes my text unreadable, but I am also not very comfortable with the language. I'm in between.  People can understand me, but I'm still making some significant mistakes.

languagelearning,Need help! Can I get advice on my French study plan?,"Hi! I'm a false beginner in french. Though lately, I've become serious about learning the language as I want to immigrate to Quebec in the near future. I took the advice of a teacher on italki and formed a study plan with his help. The teacher focused a lot on comprehensive input. I'd like advice on whether I should be doing something different or some extra stuff too. Thanks!

Study plan:

1. Assimil (1 hr)
2. Pimsleur (30 mins)
3. French readers (1 hr)
4. Extensive reading (30 mins) (I generally read Astérix as it follows the comprehensible input advice)",1615483036,klarqr,6

languagelearning,Best type of content for beginners and online immersion?,"I started teaching myself Russian over a year ago, and stalled out due to hitting a point where I just really don't know where to go. I can say basic phrases thanks to stuff like Duolingo, I have a really good grasp of the mechanics of the language thanks to YouTube channels and such, and I can read the language really well (though I don't know what most of it means). I am at a point where I need content that will push me to the next level, but I don't really know what works best for that. I really need my vocab to start growing and need to hone my ability to follow conversation. Flash cards work well for learning individual words, but I need to move onto getting conversational and consuming media in Russian.


So far I have tried channels for kids, which I have read is not great to do because a lost of languages almost use a different dialect for kids. I have tried just turning on news in Russian as I work, but I just don't pick up enough and there is no repetition. 


Any ideas? I would love to keep progressing and I know it's possible, but I have no idea where to go from here.",1615476640,dualrollers,2
