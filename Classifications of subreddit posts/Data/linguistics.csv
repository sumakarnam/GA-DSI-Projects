linguistics,Inpatient vs impatient pronunciation in American English,"My wife and I both had very mobile childhoods and wound up with what you might call General American accents, but with different idiosyncratic features from the places we grew up. 

One difference we discovered recently is that, for her, inpatient and impatient are homophones, as the /np/ in inpatient becomes [mp]whereas I pronounce the /n/ as [n]. 

Is there any research on which is more common, or regional spread of that feature in the US?",1630430886,OllieFromCairo,11
linguistics,Is Korean developing negative concord?,"A recent post about negative concord inspired this post.

So, to express ""nobody, no one"" in Korean, you use the word 아무도 *amwu-two*:

* 나는 아무도 안 죽였다. *na-nun amwu-two an cwukyess-e.*  
  I-TOP *amwu-two* not killed-DECL  
  ""I killed no one.""

*amwu-two* is only used with negative verbs (if there is a verb in the sentence), which suggests that it's a negative polarity item (NPI), and that it holds no negation in itself. In this view, *amwu-two* can be translated to English ""anyone"": ""I did not kill anyone"" = ""I killed no one.""

However, let's look at another example:

* A: 누구를 죽였어? *nwukwu-lul cwukyess-e?*  
  who-ACC killed-INF  
  ""Who did you kill?""  
  B: 아무도. *amwu-two*.  
  ""No one.""

The word *amwu-two* is being used by itself without any verb to answer the question negatively, translated to ""No one"".

So is *amwu-two* a ""anyone"" or ""no one""? The two papers I could find [1][2] suggest that it's ""no one"", and it should be analyzed as a negative concord item (NCI) instead:

* 나는 아무도 안 죽였다. *na-nun amwu-two an cwukyess-e.*  
  I-TOP **no one** not killed-DECL = ""I didn't kill no one""  
  = ""I killed no one.""

However, most NCIs from other languages I know etymologically contain a negator morpheme, e.g. informal English ""nowhere"" (e.g. ""I'm not going nowhere"" = ""I'm not going anywhere"") contains the negator ""no"", and Russian ничего (e.g. Нина ничего не знала ""Nina didn't know anything (&lt;*nothing*)"") contains the negator ""ни"", ultimately from the same origin as English ""no"" (PIE *ne).

However, *amwu-two* does not. *amwu-two* consists of two morphemes, *amwu* (&lt; Middle Korean *amwo*), and *two*. The postposition *two* means something like ""even, also"" which is far from a negation. On the other hand, *amwu* can only be used with postpositions *two* or *na* attached, and when it's used with *na* ""just, or"" (also not a negation), the combined form *amwu-na* means ""anyone"", and is used positively:

* 아무나 골라. *amwu-na kwoll-a.*  
  *amwu-na* pick-INF  
  ""Pick anyone.""

So, did Korean ""invent"" a negative concord item from nothing (no negating morphemes involved)? Are there any examples like this in other languages?

linguistics,Can you guys help me under stand the issue of colors?? How can the same order of terms be always picked the same???,"there is a popular video on linguistcs about colors

there is this from the wiki pedia article

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_term

In short, their analysis showed that in a culture with only two terms, they would roughly correlate with 'dark' (covering black, dark colors, and cold colors such as blue) and 'bright' (covering white, light colors, and warm colors such as red). All languages with three colors terms add red to this distinction. Thus, the three most basic color terms are black, white, and red. Additional color terms are added in a fixed order as a language evolves: First, one of either green or yellow; then the other; then blue. All languages distinguishing six colors contain terms for black, white, red, green, yellow, and blue. These colors roughly correspond to the sensitivities of the retinal ganglion cells, leading Berlin and Kay to argue that color naming is not merely a cultural phenomenon, but is one that is also constrained by biology—that is, language is shaped by perception. A 2012 study[10] suggested that the origin of this hierarchy may be tied to human vision and the time ordering in which these color names get accepted or agreed upon in a population perfectly matches the order predicted by the hierarchy.

very hard for me to understand this??..

you walk around and see color every where- blue sky green grass every thing..

i know we are all human so we all have a shared view of the world around us BUT it is hard to understand how you can be somehow 'forced' (like by magic??) to pick the certain colors for your color terms in that certain order????

nothing stops you from looking up at the sky and seeing blue and naming blue as your first color term 

and it is true also nothing stops you from looking at the grass and seeing green and naming green as your first color term 

so i am baffled about this same order every time..",1630423720,LinguisticsTurtle,59

linguistics,"70-77% of the words in this sample of Piraha speech start with a glottal sound (ʔ or h), and about half of the consonants as a whole are glottal. Are there any other languages with such a skewed distribution of sounds?","Out of curiosity I took [this](https://daneverettbooks.com/translation-for-an-interesting-piraha-text/) Piraha text, and did a quick check of letter frequencies of the Piraha words, after manually removing obvious Portuguese loans (about 8% of the words).

This is the distribution of consonants: https://i.imgur.com/5mb5Cn4.png

So 70% of words start with either /ʔ/ (transcribed ""X"") or /h/. If you take Everett's proposal that [k] is actually underlyingly /hi/ (which does make sense as there are lots of ""ka""s and ""ko""s in the text, but zero ""ki""s), then it goes up to 76.8% of words starting with a glottal phoneme.

linguistics,Is the English language starting to become more agglutinative?,"The other day, I was scrolling another sub on Reddit, where a user complained, with regards to another website altogether, that after making a comment the moderators didn't approve of, he had been ""InstapermashadowIPbanned.""

(i.e. Instantly banned permanently, on the basis of his IP address rather than username, but without being informed that other people could no longer see his posts)

15 years ago, such a word would not exist, and if you could magically travel back in time and ask people in 2006 what it meant, most would have practically no idea what you were talking about. Even today, many people in the older generations and those who don't use the Internet much, would struggle to understand. But for those who use social media regularly, the meaning is clear. And while the word is currently clearly rooted in the domain of Internet slang and would not be used in any formal discussion, new words and mechanisms of speech often start out as informal jargon, before slowly permeating their way into formal speech which tends to be more conservative.

Such a level of agglutination, with 4 prefixes preceding the main morpheme (""ban""), in additional to the -ed past tense suffix, is unusual in English, but has started to become more common in certain Internet slang words, so far confined mostly to the online sphere. However, that may change over time as the language evolves, and the Internet becomes even more integrated into daily life.

Also, according to theories of language evolution, the morphology of a language changes in a cyclical fashion over time. Languages ""start out"" with an agglutinative morphology, which over time becomes fusional, then analytic, and finally isolating, before returning back to an agglutinative state, restarting the cycle. While English is not an entirely isolating languages (languages that isolate more than English include Vietnamese, Yoruba, and Afrikaans), it is more analytic than most Indoeuropean languages, and thus at some point agglutinative tendencies may become more prominent. So could the use of these longer words be the first sign of a proces, that could admittedly take several centuries, of English evolving into a more agglutinative state? Will future speakers of a much more agglutinative English consider the current period to be the beginning of English's evolution into an agglutinative language?

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1630321214,AutoModerator,161

linguistics,parts of stem reanalyzed as affixes,"So a while ago I checked, as a part of work avoiding behavior, the etymology of the Dutch plural markers, and one, -en, comes from the plural ending of the so-called weak nouns. The Germanic weak nouns in turn come from nouns that ended in an /n/ in PIE. However, in Middle Dutch these nouns had lost all their PIE endings, and in some cases also the /n/ of the stem, but on others (including all plural forms) the /n/ remained. This -(e)n ending was then reanalyzed as a plural. Another plural marker in Dutch is -eren, which is a double plural marker, the -en just discussed, and -er, and it seems that in German, and presumably in Dutch, the ending -er comes from nouns ending in os/es in PIE, where the -os was lost, and the -es was reanalyzed as a plural suffix.  Now, strictly speaking, the -os/es ending is a derivational suffix (as far as I know) making neuter nouns out of some stems, and a lot of weak nouns may also come from derivational suffixes ending in an /n/. Also, already in PIE those derivational suffixes had different forms depending on the grammatical context, which may have helped the reanalysis as inflectional suffixes.

I just wondered how common this is. I think the most common story you hear about the origin of plural affixes is that they come from a grammaticalized word for ""more"" or another related meaning, or at least, if someone were to ask me as a linguist what the origin of plural markers in general was I would give that answer. In general, grammaticalization of words to inflectional is the main source for affixes. But maybe this reanalysis might be more common than you'd think (I  think that the Romanian suffix -uri could also be the result of a similar reanalysis of Latin words ending in -us/-or- for instance). I also wonder if there are similar cases other than plural markers.",1630318553,merijn2,1

linguistics,language varieties that are languages?,"Language varieties :
Any set of linguistic forms which patterns according to social factors: i.e. used under specific social circumstances. The term includes different accents, different linguistic  styles, different dialects and even different languages which contrast with each other for social reasons.

Language :a language can be thought of as a collection of dialects that are usually linguistically similar, used by different social groups who choose to say that they are speakers of one language which functions to unite and represent them to other groups.

Pidgin :
A pidgin is a language which has no native speakers.

Creole :
A pidgin which has acquired native speakers and has consequently expanded in structure (grammar and vocabulary) in order to express the range of meanings and functions required of a first language.

Lingua franca:
A language serving as a means of 
communication between speakers whose first languages differ.

Standard variety / Standard Language / Standard dialect :
Language variety which generally has a written form and which has undergone some degree of codification. It is the variety taught in schools and has high prestige. It is generally regarded by the community as the ‘correct’ variety.

Nonstandard dialect / Vernacular dialect :
Linguistic forms or varieties that do not conform to the standard.

linguistics,Spoken Language Speed and Linguistic Relativity,"Just a moment ago I was listening to native Spanish speakers (specifically speakers in Mexico City) for some immersion learning (ok, and because it was a cooking video), but it made me stop and think.  Some languages when spoken by native speakers, are lightning fast.  Even I, a native English speaker, seem to have a kind of speed limiter that requires words to be spoken relatively slowly when to other languages.

As some or maybe most of you are aware, linguistic relativity suggests that the way we think is shaped by our primary mode of communication, particularly in spoken and written language.  Listening to the gentleman go through an entire dialogue at a mile a minute caused me to wonder, do people whose native languages are spoken at a faster pace *think* and *comprehend* faster?  Perhaps this is the wrong place to pose this question, and if so, please direct me to where I should seek answers.

Even if OT writing did not consistently reflect this distinction, it was still possible that OT had a different sort of opposition than voicing (even if just word-initially so), which was what their adopted script reflected, and hence such an opposition was not reflected in writing (cf.

Maybe a sign off too, 3 .. 1 as in 'over and out'.

Is this some kind of universal (that I can't find)? Universals about POA's for stops seem to be focussed on the fact that languages tend to miss p or g, if they miss one of p t k b d g. But if a language has b t k as their stop series, that still makes three places of articulation.

But then on the other hand, Hawaiian has p t/k ʔ: one of p t k is missing (which one depends on the variety), but it has a glottal stop. So tadaa, three POA's :-p

linguistics,"Is there anything on English pronunciation of *consonant* 〈y〉, /j/, and how its realization might vary across regional accents?","I think it is fairly well established that on paper, Standard English and all its varieties, the _consonant_ 〈y〉 is always realised as /j/.
However, I am reading Dr. David Crystal's excellent book, _Think on my Words_, in which he takes on the rather large task of giving a general introduction to the 10% or so difference in vocabulary, 5% difference in grammar, and 70% (hyperbole) difference in pronunciation of OP, as well as go over manuscript variation, spelling conventions, etc.
And in his book, he writes just as a gloss, about 〈i〉 vs. 〈j〉 (as they were not distinguished until around the 1620's, in English):

&gt; A similar trend affected _i_ and _j_ \[similar trend to how 〈u〉 became solely vsed as a vowel and how 〈v〉 became solely vsed as consonant\].
&gt; The _i_ symbols, wether short 〈i〉 or elongated 〈j〉, were used both for a vowel **(with the sound of the modern** _**y**_ **in** ***yes***) and for the consanant (as in modern _j_ in _judge_).

Now, I don't want to get to much in pronunciation quirks according to individuals—anecdotes.
I could tell you right now, that I often believe I pronounce 〈y〉 as a consonant as \[ɪ\].
When I stress it, I often pronounce it as \[ç~ʝ\] and \[ʑ\], and I also do pronounce it as the usual approximant \[j̥~j\].
In fact, I often unvoice voiced consonants word initially.
But I have strayed from my point.

I recognize that we mishear things.
And even worse, we mistranscribe things, even our very tongues, if we are not careful.
Especially lacking experience.
But I do believe I have heard this before in speech, indeed even Crystal's speech.
I am decently familiar with Turkic languages, which usually can't allow diphthongs, and as such combinations that in English might be rendered as /aɪ/, /ɔɪ/, and /wi~ui/ can only rendered in Turkic language _B_ as /ɑjĕ/, /ojĕ/, and /ujĕ/.
It is distantly related, but many English speakers, because long vowels can only occur before voiced consonants, a word like _see_, where you actually have a ""tru"" _long-vowel_, it becomes realised as \[sij\] to those like me who put the long ""vowel"" there, and \[si\] in unstressed positions.

That said, I don't think I am mishearing anything, but I am curious if there has been any analysis of this—I am sure there has.",1630032587,MrRichBOB,6

I love my current philosophy degree, but I've realised that in the future I'd like to have a job that lets me learn and practice languages, or at least something related to languages. I am thinking about becoming a teacher, either of my native Spanish or of any other language that I learn (so far I can speak English and I'm working to get my German to the next level, but in the future I'd like to learn to her languages too). 

I'm basically wondering which would be the best way to work on that wish, given that I am already in Philosophy. Giving up the degree is not an option I truly consider (unless it is the only way), because I already gave one and I don't really feel like doing it again; so I want to finish it. But afterwards, what is the best way to become a language teacher? Should I do a Master on Linguistics or something less academical, related to teaching or teaching languages? This way I would try to work as a language teacher but with a mainly philosophical education. On the contrary, should I begin another undergraduate degree (after I finish Philosophy) so that I can build a proper linguistic career? Is Linguistics what I should be studying or it's better to choose a language an study Philology if you're gonna be a teacher?

I would like to spend this next 3 years bettering my language skills, so that I can start studying linguistics (or whatever it finally is) with a good knowledge of at least 3-4 languages as a foundation. I understand linguistics it's not (necessarily) about learning languages, but I do love doing that and it would be great to combine the two. I don't want to miss the linguistic approach either, I really enjoy learning about how language works in general.

If someone has got experience regarding how is he field's situation in Spain, I'd love to hear it too. Anyway, I'm open to consider other countries if their studying programms are suggested. 

Thank you very much :)",1629991147,lordvaryous,5
linguistics,There is no difference between /tʲ/ and /c/?," I'm a native Russian speaker, and, as you may know, the /t/ sound in Russian is dental, as well as /d/ and /n/. The majority of consonants have their soft (palatallized) counterparts: /m/\~/mʲ/, /f/\~/fʲ/. Everything is more or less understandable, but when it comes to dental stops, weird things start to happen. On [ru.wiktionary.org](https://ru.wiktionary.org/) the word ""дети"" (""deti"") is marked to be pronounced as \[ˈdʲetʲɪ\]. From that, one could say that you're supposed to pronounce the sounds in this case as pallatalized dental stops. But nobody actually pronounces it this way. In fact, pronouncing it as pallatalized dentals would sound like an accent. To me, the sound appears closer to \[ˈɟecɪ\], where the sounds are pallatal stops and not palatalized dental stops. I never heard any native speaker pronounce it with palatallized dental stops, instead palatal stops. Listening to the audio samples of the sounds on Wikipedia only confirms it.

So, I'm asking you to help me understand whether I'm missing something after all or there is in fact something wrong or deliberately ambiguous with the transcription. In Western European languages, palatal stops occur as palarallized counterparts for velar stops (k ,g). But I don't see the difference between the sound \[ɟ\] in the Hungarian word &lt;magyar&gt; \[ˈmɒɟɒr\] and the Russian sound \[dʲ\] in the word &lt;дети&gt; \[ˈdʲetʲɪ\].",1629989906,fixion_generator,55

linguistics,What kind of doctor can I seek that will help identify my speech problems?,"Background: I am a 28F that is hearing impaired. Completely deaf in my right ear since either birth or young age (my doctor when I was young was unsure since it was discovered a bit late).

I remember taking ESL classes in elementary school but it was only for a year. Since then, I have not had anything else. 

I get my hearing tested by audiologist every 2 years and have been since childhood. I have never had any hearing aids growing up. My original ENT doctor retired during my childhood years. The new one I’ve been seeing after him, always told me “you don’t qualify for hearing aids.” It wasn’t until this February that I told my audiologist what my ENT doctor has told me and asked if this is true. She was so shocked, the look on her face of disgust. I will never forget. She said “….you do qualify for hearing aids. You NEED hearing aids. You have missed out on a lot over the years. Hearing aids will help with you so much.” She did explain it won’t totally improve my hearing but that I won’t further miss out. 

I confronted my ENT and he seemed annoyed that I wanted to try hearing aids. I finally got them and I’m still adjusting to them.

I believe due to this, it has caused me to have speech issues. I do have difficult with comprehension (says in my childhood doctors notes). But I have noticed growing up, I have difficulty finding words when speaking. What I want to say, sounds good in my head but when I speak, I sound stupid. I don’t stutter. People look at me stupid when I am trying to explain something to am telling a story.

My doctor has not given me any guidance on who I can seek help from with this. I have no ideas who specializes in this.

Anyone else have this same issue that is hearing impaired? I feel stupid and have always had problems doing speeches in school. I hate doing speech because of these issues. It’s embarrassing and I’m tired of people looking at me stupid and thinking I’m stupid. I miss up my words alot too",1629966833,randomxuser,4

linguistics,Transgender Nouns???,"I noticed a sign in the restroom today stating: ""Manos limpias te protectan"" something like that. 

Context for non Spanish speakers = ""mano"" (hand) is feminine, though feminine words typically end in an ""a"". So... it's ""la"" mano, even though students of Spanish (and perhaps young children) mistake it as ""el mano"" 

In Spanish, and likely all gendered languages, irregular verbs are common. And, at least in Spanish, the phrase ""la mano"" is common enough, that native speakers tend to remember it's actually feminine, even though it sounds masculine. 

However, w/ the adjective after the verb ""limpia"", it struck me that ""manos limpios"" (masculine) rolled off the tongue much better. Not only does ""manos limpios"" sound correct ""from a gendered nouns perspective"" it also rhymes, which could be a cause for phonetic shifts. 

So... question time... 

In gendered languages, is there any evidence of irregular nouns ""changing"" genders over the years? 

I could easily imagine ""mano"" becoming masculine, with no ambiguity or communication errors arising. 

Or... are irregular nouns a result of language change? Was ""mano"" once masculine and somehow transitioned?",1629913091,aranhalaranja,32

linguistics,Query on known v. unknown subjects as linguistic categories (with applications to singular they),"Apologies for clumsy phrasing in the question; I don't have any formal training in linguistics and am doing my best to get at a murky problem I've been mulling. My best attempt at direct phrasing is, ""Is there evidence for 'known/identified subjects/referents' and 'unknown/unidentified subjects/referents' as linguistic categories in natural languages?""

&amp;#x200B;

For context, I've noticed something of a paradox by which most folks intuitively use the singular *they* when talking about an unidentified subject (e.g. ""My doctor called me."" ""Oh, what'd they say?"") but encounter a cognitive barrier with using it for identified subjects, more in output than in understanding (i.e., they'll understand the sentence ""My partner Sam said they're coming into town tomorrow"", but be unlikely to reproduce the pronoun usage in a reply). Aside from attitudes about trans and nonbinary people, including transphobia, are there cognitive linguistic reasons for this difficulty? 

&amp;#x200B;

In my experience, there's an evolving social dimension to this question. [Some have argued](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/5dqz2k/singular_they_starting_to_replace_he_and_she_when/) that the singular *they* is used only for unknown or nonspecific subjects. Others will argue that there is no such distinction, either historically or presently, and attribute any difficulty to ideological (rather than linguistic) origins. Middle ground exists as well.

linguistics,"The pronunciation of ""T"" being wrong very often in IPA or other pronunciation guides","I expect that this applies much more broadly, but all I can speak for is places near where I live (Northeast US). IPA guides for many words, including the example I'll use here, which is Connecticut, appear to often vary multiple times from the actual pronunciation, especially with the letter ""T"".

The name Connecticut can be found in all sources as being pronounced ""/kəˈnɛtɪkət/"" (or some other way of writing the same pronunciation outside of the IPA).

However, I and the several people I asked from the state all pronounce it ""/kəˈnɛdɪkɪʔ/"", which you can see varies in 3 different places from the suppose pronuncation.

One of them, the /ə/ as an /ɪ/, is a simple difference in vowel pronunciation, but the other 2 are concerning the letter ""t"" and its pronunciation, not only in General American English, but in British English as well.

This made me look through several other locations, and wherever the ""T"" was alone in the middle or end of a word, it was written as /t/, even though in most accents of English it wouldn't be pronounced as such.

When ""T"" is found in the middle of a word alone in GA, it is pronounced /d/, and when it is found at the end of the word, it is pronounced /ʔ/. In much of Britain and Australia, both are /ʔ/.

Yet somehow, pronunciation guides almost always show ""T"" as being solely as /t/.

chomsky said this

There is interesting work on precepts for language use under particular conditions—notably intent to be informative, as in neo-Gricean pragmatics—but it is not at all clear how far this extends to the normal use of language, and in any event, it does not approach the Cartesian questions of creative use, which remains as much of a mystery now as it did centuries ago, and may turn out to be one of those ultimate secrets that ever will remain in obscurity, impenetrable to human intelligence.

a friend- who has a phd- said this

I *think* chomsky is just saying that if you limit accounts of use to contexts where the Gricean idealizations apply, then you might be able to say some interesting things about assertion and implicature. My *guess* is that he's thinking about Danny Fox and Gennaro Chierchia here, since they stay pretty close to syntax.

But the Gricean idealizations may apply only to a fragment of ""the normal use of language.""

I want to say that men using “my dear” or other terms of address that can have either a feminine quality or romantic quality to them in order to address other men historically (and even now) acts as a ‘tell’ or signal of their queerness.

linguistics,"This week's Q&amp;A thread -- please read before asking or answering a question! - August 23, 2021","Do you have a question about language or linguistics? You’ve come to the right subreddit! We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1629716419,AutoModerator,185
linguistics,Distribution question abour War and Wore in AusEng,"Hi everyone, 

I can't get my head around distribution and allophones. So if we put the two words next to eachother, a speaker knows that they have different meanings. But if they are spoken, we wouldn't know the difference right? So I don't understand what type of distribution that homophones have because it depends if it is spelled out or not...

I hope this question makes sense?

linguistics,Which languages are 'outliers' in different ways??,"i guess that there is maybe no way to say which languages are the most 'interesting' or most 'weird'- what would be the metric- and yet you can pick some metrics and then pick the languages that are truly objective outliers on those metrics??

for example i heard that hawaiian has only twelve phonemes or something like that which would - i guess - make that language a outlier in a objective way ... ON THE SPECIFIC metric of phonemes....it doesnt mean the language is a outleir in OTHER ways 

another one is piraha - a language everyone talks about..there is a lot of controversy about this language....i do not know if its true this language is different from other languages similar to piraha- and the other thing is that maybe ALL of the languages in pirahas 'family' are ALL similar to each other but ALL of them are 'outliers' from languages not in that family

i heard it is not unusual for languages to lack numberals in the way that piraha does..see my friends following comment 

Ken Hale worked with many (mostly Australian indigenous) languages that lack numbers beyond 3 or 4 and colors.  He showed that they lack the words, but have the concepts.  Thus they lack red, but have blood-like.  As for numbers, when they enter a market society they function fine.

It’s been known for 70 years, since Lenneberg’s original work on linguistic relativity, that having the words provides cues that facilitate memory and recognition.  Thus if you have the words “red” and “orange” you’re better at remembering color chips at the boundary – as would be expected.

and my friend has harsh words about piraha saying that the following paper shows that there is nothing truly special about this language- it is all hype

http://lingphil.mit.edu/papers/pesetsk/Nevins_Pesetsky_Rodrigues_2_Evidence_and_Argumentation_Reply_to_Everett.pdf

she is very harsh about this and says this about it

The language seems no different from many others, apart from the highly successful scam.

Every language is interesting. What’s interesting about Piraha is that so many people fall for the scam. 

but i want obviously i want to see the facts so if there is a paper- particular paper you can cite not a vague comment but a real paper reference- that i can look at and show to her then that would be useful to show that this language is truthfully an outlier in some metric or another",1629702029,LinguisticsTurtle,57

So why did that end up happening instead of having a symbol for each sound? Especially that the supposed origin of arabic had distinctions between some of them. Also why is the letters that look like the ب are the sounds of the ت and the ث not, for example, the sounds of ف or ر. Same for ح, why does the ج and خ sounds get the ح symbol rather than م or ك.

I heard some letters started representing two sounds when Arabic got additional letters over the semetic language(like how ذ was added and given the same shape as د) so that explains why some symbols denoted 2 sounds but other sounds were always there in the semetic language yet just became one symbol in Arabic so why is that and what is the basis that relates them(like د and ذ are close in pronunciation but not ب and ت and ث).",1629630409,MegaMoh,8

linguistics,Is it possible to randomly generate a sensical language beyond just a word swap?,"This is a bit out there, but something that popped into my mind recently. After seeing a video about that game eternal darkness for the gamecube, I wanted to know if it was possible to randomly generate a novel language using some basic rules of language. 

Part of that game is using gathered magical runes to cast spells by combining them in groups of ideas - i.e. putting up a barrier around you by combining the protect and area runes. What I heard recently though was apparently in early development the game was supposed to have essentially a new language that you'd have to piece together using context or translations provided in game that was going to be more than just some word swap, but that feature eventually got cut. 

What I'd like to know is if it's theoretically possible to have a completely new language (not just ones based on alphabets but writing systems of all types) be generated algorithmically. The idea of every player having to actually try and learn a language to put together spells in a horror game like eternal darkness was intended to be  seems like it'd fit very well, especially as it would put a cap on how powerful a player was unless they really tried to work on it. 

Also, if it's possible to do something like that, would there also be a way to allow someone to be able to learn that language to the point of being able to string together basic sentences using a limited vocabulary, or would that be just too far beyond what's possible?",1629592669,Lancashire_Toreador,12

linguistics,Why don't any French adjectives end in /m/ or /ɲ/?,"In French, when we add suffixes that start with a vowel to words that end in a nasal vowel, the nasal vowel becomes an oral vowel and one of the three French nasal consonants: /m/, /n/ and /ɲ/. Examples are ""nom"" /nɔ̃/ &gt; ""nommer"" /nɔ.me/, ""son"" /sɔ̃/ &gt; ""sonner"" /sɔ.ne/ and ""loin"" /lwɛ̃/ &gt; ""éloigner"" /e.lwa.ɲe/. This is also the way to indicate the feminine with many adjectives, like ""fin"" /fɛ̃/ &gt; ""fine"" /fin/ and even the indefinite article ""un"" /œ̃/ &gt; ""une"" /yn/. 

This is because French nasal vowels originated from a nasal consonant that nasalized the preceding vowel, then disappeared in coda position. But, if there is a following vowel, the nasal isn't in coda position, so the same changes didn't happen, and the historic nasal and oral vowel are revealed. 

However, with adjectives, we don't find any examples of a historic /m/ or /ɲ/ that reappears when we add the feminine suffix. This means that the only option when an adjective ends in a nasal vowel is that there is an /n/. 

Perhaps this is an example of regularization, but I doubt that since I've looked that the etymology of many French words, and haven't found a single example, nor have I found any documentation for it.

Hi all,

I just stumbled upon this subreddit and am wondering if any of you had any advice to give. My wife and I are expecting and we are just getting started researching what may be the best strategy for our newborn.

For background: I am bilingual German-French and my wife is Spanish speaking. We live in the U.S., so the ""outside world"" language is English (with plenty of Spanish, but still majority English). My wife and I speak Spanish to each other.

We are 100% sure that we want to raise our kid multilingual, and that my wife will speak Spanish to the child. The question I have is whether I should focus on one language, meaning I choose French or German and speak this exclusively, or whether I could actually speak two languages (French and German) to the kid. I haven't researched this a great deal yet, as we still have 6 months to go, but I would love to hear from some parents if they had any experience with speaking two languages to their child, knowing that the child will already be exposed to another two languages - Spanish from the mother and English from the outside world, nursery, etc.... I am thinking I could speak one week French, one week German, but obviously don't want to overwhelm the kid.....

linguistics,About Mongolic....,"So I was just browsing Wikipedia and I like language families and all the hypotheses. I am a off and on biblical literalist (I debate it myself) for context so I always feel language families can be grouped. With that in mind my mindset is more practical and I don't believe in discredited groupings such as Altaic, and I am not going to go all Conservative on you in any discussion, as obviously it should be discussed in a secular manner and approached as such. I'm just disclosing my own potential biases.

With that context out of the way, let me delve into this as a amateur hobbyist. I'm typing on phone so pardon my lack of link, and it's just a question anyway

I ask what language families does it seem closely related to? 
Initially I considered Proto-Sino Tibetan however among further study, it has more geographically in common with the Indo European languages, and religiously as well. However that doesn't feel quite right. 
Genetically, wouldn't they, if from Proto Proto Indo European, be more white(I admit I don't exactly know how that works), but we don't to my knowledge have any DNA evidence.
Thus,  that feels odd. 

Yenisean and Tungusic lack much evidence. Turkic has some similarities. 

However after scrolling through a lot, I would like to ask the possibility of a Koreanic connection. This admittedly lacks much evidence whatsoever, however studying the Mongolic, Turkic, and Koreanic, there seem to be links, though not enough nearly to justify a Altaic family.

I'm not really coming into this with anything in mind except having been interested in this, so this is more of a question and not a hypothesis. As a filthy casual, I would like to hear some discussion on this to better understand that ill defined area.
Do we know the languages of the people that the Mongols descended from? Is there any discernible lineage? I know Proto Mongolic is debated, but do we have any idea of who they were, even if not what they spoke?

linguistics,"Is the concept of individual words innate to human language, or does it arise as a result of written language?","We can very intuitively pick out what makes up a single word in our language ... or at least most of the time. Highschool is one word but ice cream isn't, even though the stress pattern is the same and they're both compound nouns. This can be hard to predict and I second guess myself (of course this is anecdotal but it makes me wonder).

So, is it writing that makes a word a word? Can illiterate people discern what a single word is as easily?

languages with different levels of synthesis have vastly different boundaries for where words begin. Polysynthetic languages count whole sentences at words, but do they? Why couldn't 'inuktitusunguvit' (do you speak inuktitut, probably spelling it wrong) be spelled 'inuktitu su ngu viit'? the typical answer is that the individual parts it the word change from the roots, but in what way is this different from inflection? su could be described as a form of 'suuq' depending where it occurs in an utterance. (in the above word/ sentence suuq becomes su in that context, disclaimer: I don't speak inuktitut) Why is suuq becoming su grounds for it not being a word because of its dependency on surrounding sounds, why not the indefinite a/an in english? 

I suppose what makes a word a word is the underlying stress patterns, but Is this universally recognized? Why would the concept of a single word as we know it mean anything to an illiterate speaker of a polysynthetic language? Wouldn't they be more likely to understand their language in terms of the individual roots? 

How much research has been conducted on how language itself is perceived by speakers of very different languages, as well as illiterate people and people of varying socioeconomic status?

It wouldn't surprise me if many languages had no word for 'word', and what we've translated into english and the modern written world was something different.

I could be wrong though. Does anyone know much about all this?",1629146709,Strobro3,45
linguistics,How trustworthy is Ethnologue?,"I'm getting seemingly inconsistent statements from a paper and from Ethnologue.

Bennett et al. (2015) say:

&gt; Official census estimates suggest that about 40% of Guatemalans speak a Mayan language natively; this almost certainly underestimates the actual percentage of native Mayan speakers in the country, **which is likely 50–60% or higher** (Fischer and Brown, 1996a; England 2003)

(emph added)

In contrast, Ethnologue 2021 says this about Spanish:

&gt; Spanish [spa] (Castellano, Español). Autonym: Castellano, Español. Users: 15,840,000 in Guatemala, all users. **L1 users: 12,100,000 in Guatemala** (2018 World Factbook). **L2 users: 3,740,000 (2018)**

(emph added)

So Ethnologue says that only 23.6% of Guatemalans speak a language other than Spanish as L1. 

How do I explain this apparent discrepancy? Does it have to do with a distinction between “native language” and “L1”? Is it just that Ethnologue has a more recent source? Is such a big difference (50-60% down to 23%) possible?

When a great scientist leaves us, the temptation is strong to say that she was a giant in her field. That doesn’t quite work for Lila Gleitman. The study of language acquisition, her primary scientific concern, was her field in a special sense: she virtually created the field in its modern for and led in its impressive development ever since.
 
Others had studied child language, but Lila was really the first to raise probing questions about what children know and how that knowledge is attained, questions informed by theoretical understanding and directed to issues of far-reaching importance. More than that, Lila developed elegant experiments to answer these questions, devising models that have guided experimental research throughout the years.
 
Many of the conclusions that Lila firmly established are quite startling. She and others working under her guidance were able to show that the child attains rich knowledge on the basis of very slight data, far beyond what the very young child exhibits in performance, suggesting that the data serve in fundamental ways as a triggering device. Her research also elucidates the means by which this remarkable achievement takes place.
 
Lila’s work constitutes a fundamental and highly original contribution not only to the study of language and its acquisition, but to the understanding of the human mind and its unique capacities far more generally.
 
Another reason why it is hard for me to write about Lila’s leaving us is that she was a close personal friend for 60 years. But those feelings hold for just about everyone who was lucky enough to have known her. Lila was one of those rare people who becomes a close friend virtually on first contact — an immediate reaction to her warmth, her wit, her sympathetic understanding. These qualities persisted unchanged, even amplified, through adversity that seemed only to heighten her rare personal qualities. It made her seem immortal.
 
And in important ways, she is.
 
-Noam Chomsky

Lila Gleitman died a week ago Sunday, a sad event for everybody who knew her as well as our field. Lila had an extremely distinguished career in the study of language. It is not easy to think of a more distinguished psycholinguist. Her work was always characterized by an intense focus on careful and telling empirical analysis of fundamental issues. She never forgot her linguistic roots, and this interaction helped to mold her career’s work.
 
Her career is full of probing experimental questions on the most important issues. Who can forget her beautiful experimental take-down of the famous claims of Amos Tversky and his colleagues that seemingly precise terms were actually represented in the human mind in a much more approximate way, with all sorts of strange results. This extended all the way to the number system. “Which numeral is the most odd?” was an answerable experimental question in the view she was arguing against, a view that was beginning to dominate the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology at the time. Lila knew that how you asked a question was as important as the statistical analysis of results.
 
When I searched the literature for useable studies of the linguistic input to the child developing language for my 1980 book with Peter Culicover, the most useful and careful one I could find was the beautiful empirical demonstration by Elissa Newport, Henry Gleitman and Lila that the input didn’t include a kind of “teaching language,” contra to the standard psychological claim at the time. This helped to establish the need for the child to have some prior knowledge of the nature of language. She pushed the view that the input to the child was extensively from surface information, reflecting, I believe, her studies with Harris with its emphases on distributional analysis. She produced quite a few empirical demonstrations of how this input could be used. In a beautifully simple experiment, she showed that even adults (and thus presumably children) couldn’t figure out the meaning of a verb from context, although they could for nouns. In Noam Chomsky’s terms the meaning of a verb is then not “epistemologically available.”
 
My comments barely scratch the surface of Lila’s work. She produced generations of students who filled psychology departments around the country and who were strongly devoted to her. When we first met we hit it off instantly, becoming good friends. I will miss her and her constant interest, ideas, conversations, work and general support for our great enterprise. Who will be that thinking psychologist who allows for the hope of integration of our fields?

linguistics,"Instead of Changing English Spelling, What If We Teach the Dialect of Standard English alongside Someone’s Regional Dialect?","From what I can tell, there are certain orthographic clues in written Standard English that evince the sounds words should make. As an example, I highlight the use of yods.

In written Standard English, there are various orthographic clues that a yod is present in a word, including but not limited to the following:

XCion, like union, nation, and mission

XuiX, like suit

XueX, like fuel

XuCV, like pure or yule 

Xew, like new or few or ewe.

where X is any given letter or string of letters in English including the null string, C is any given consonant, and V is any given vowel.

I find there are other orthographic markers in English that imply a certain sound or otherwise. It makes me think that Standard English is supposed to be pronounced a certain way, and that this pronunciation isn’t necessarily the same as a regional dialect, like Hiberno-English. 

Thus, I think it would benefit all English speakers to learn a Standard Dialect for all English speakers to use as a method of common tongue, and that the Regional Dialect would exist alongside it for use during informal situations. However, I must admit that I have thought this through little comparatively to actual linguists in the field. I also recognize that some phonological features are just hard for some dialects to mimic, like the /th/ phonemes in Hiberno-English, or an un-coalesced yod in American English, and that such differences could breed feelings of elitism. Although, I also believe through anecdote that no one dialect could pronounce English as it is actually written, so a Standard English Dialect could also equalize the playing field for speakers of other dialects.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1629111620,AutoModerator,196

linguistics,Is learning Italian first the best basis for Moving onto other Romance Languages? Also is Italian (or the various languages of Italy) the closest of the modern Romance family to Latin?,"I was told by a few multilingual language that Italian gives a basic middle ground between all the romance language in that for example while a Spaniard will understand a lot of Portuguese easily without any prior study,  he'd have a much harder time with French and won't understand most Romanian basics.

Italian on the otherhand not only has a lot of similar pronunciation to Spanish in addition to word but also shares a lot in common with French structure and in addition was deemed on a quick google to be the closest language to Romanian of the Romance family. And its a big help plenty and plenty of other romance languages such as Sicilian are within the modern Italian borders and islands nearby Italy as well as also in regions cross Spain like Catalan and various islands and port locations in the Mediterranean that were major trading hubs dominated by Italian merchants in the Medieval Ages.

So plenty of people tell me Italian is the best starting point as a result of being in the absolute center ground if you plan to specialize in romance languages. And its a big help that Italy is the capital of Catholicism and most cultures with Romance tongues are primarily Catholic and that Italy is one of the economic superpowers of modern times.

It is all for this reason I was also told that Italian is the closest to Latin of the existing Romance languages in their current form. So I was told specialize in Italian first if you intend to go deep into Ancient Roman studies because its the closest (and it does't help Italy is where the Roman Empire's heartland was so you'd have to learn it anyway if you start Latin language as a hobby).

linguistics,Can advanced literature be effectively translated into a language without an extensive literary tradition?,"For example, could one take ""Anna Karenina"" or ""One Hundred Years in Solitude"" (arbitrary examples) and translate it into Maori or Inuktitut and have the translation be effective? I've never studied linguistics as a formal discipline, which is why I'm making this post to get answers from people who actually know what they're talking about, but my personal hunch would be ""no"". Maori or Inuktitut are languages with rich oral traditions centered around storytelling, which is a distinctly different medium from literature, therefore I conjecture that they would be ill-equipped to handle translating something like the above examples. I think you could tell the events of the plot effectively in these languages, but they would be missing several finer details and nuances, as well as more complex and abstract idea, that actually make the book worth reading. I also think that some concepts might be hard to translate across cultures. For example, ""Don Quixote"" probably won't make a lot of sense to a collectivist culture because of its existential/individualistic themes. 

On the other hand, I know that the Bible has been translated into Inuktitut and Cherokee and several other North American indigenous languages, and translating the Bible is no easy feat to say the least. These shows that complex topics and abstractions can be translated effectively. Even then, I still feel like the Bible is different then the other works mentioned above. Even the Bible itself originally came from passed down oral storytelling that eventually became transcribed. But I'm no scholar on the matter and could easily be wrong. 

I also feel like I have to make a disclaimer: in light of stuff like cancel culture and increased sensitivity, the ""position"" (i.e uneducated guess) I've taken can easily invite sanctimonious accusations of westerncentrism and racism. First of all, the two books I listed are western because I am ignorant of literature outside the western world. You can easily substitute those books with something from India or Japan. Furthermore, there's nothing about the idea of ""it's hard to translate books into languages that don't have a history of writing books"" that is racist. One has to think of the social context of how these languages emerged. Additionally, I'm not concerned with arguments over aesthetics about what qualifies as ""high"" literature; rather, I only care about the practical matters and linguistic analysis of this topic. Regardless of subjective assertions about aesthetics, ""Anna Karenina"" is harder and more complicated to translate than ""Harry Potter"" is just the straight facts, and not really a matter of opinion.",1628851611,FlaccoPastorius,1

linguistics,Bangla vs Sylheti,"Not sure if this is the place to ask this, but was hoping someone could point me in the right direction. 

I am a British-Bengali who, like most Bengalis in the UK, speaks Sylheti because my grandparents came from the Sylhet region of Bangladesh as did most other Bangladeshis living in the UK. 

At school, I learned French and Spanish and studied a little Catalan while studying in Spain. 

I noticed the differences between many of the Romance languages and realised that Sylheti was very different to Bangla, the official language of Bengal and Bangladesh. Officially, Sylheti is a dialect of Bangla. 

Sylheti once had its own alphabet and often has very different words and grammar. However, most Bengalis seem to believe it to be a dialect and not a separate language. 

I was wondering if anyone had any resources or academic papers which prove that Sylheti is indeed a distinct language on its own and not merely a dialect.",1628631295,Nish786,8

linguistics,Research on how taboo words like YHWH change (or don't) over time?,"Hi! Like anyone I was spending my Tuesday evening watching a debate between an Orthodox Jew and Messianic Jew on the divinity of the Jewish ""Oral Law"" in Hebrew with subtitles. Although not speaking any Hebrew, I do know a few basic words like brit, Elohim and Hashem. However, what I realized was that I had never heard a Jew say the name of God, YHWH, and I seemed to remember that it's this sort of thing that ""no one has ever heard a Jew say the name of God because it's too holy"". So it made me think: if a word is borderline taboo to speak, like the name of a deity, how is it passed on? Sure I get that a Jewish mother might whisper the name to the young son, but unless a word is used often, surely it will change over time? Especially in an oral tradition, but maybe (probably?) within a written one as well? Or? What about things like intonation, does where you put the emphasis change quicker than for other words? In Hebrew specifically, where the vowels are not written down, is there any certainty that YHWH is pronounced the few times it is today as it was just 200 years ago? 100 years ago? What is to say that it doesn't start with an A before the consonants, like AYHWH? Or that all vowels are O, so it's YOHOWOH? Etc.

And a second, offshot question: 

During periods of time when one Romance language (Italian, for example) pronounced &lt;SC&gt; as /ʃ/ before front vowels but another Romance language (Piedmontese, for example) did not, how would the second language transcribe the first's sound?

For example: let's say a Piedmontese speaker, an amateur linguist, in the 1300s wants to transcribe his Italian friend's speech in order to see what sounds come up. The IPA isn't invented yet.

linguistics,What are some features that are common in your dialect of English that differ from Standard English?,"I’ll go first. I’m from the South with a big Southern family, and many people know about things like “y’all” and the pen-pin merger. However, one feature of Southern American English that I rarely see commented on is our use of the word “yonder.”

In Southern talk, we have “here,” “there,” and “yonder.” Yonder is used to mean objects or places in the far distance, like over a hill or cross a field. Then we can increase the range even further by using the phrase “way over yonder,” meaning far off past where we can see; past the horizon, even. 

Unlike its archaic use, though, I haven’t heard “yonder” or “yon” used as adjectives used in everyday speech, like “what light through yonder window break?” Instead, people use “that”, “those”, or a possessive adjective in conjunction with the adjectival phrase “over yonder,” which is used exclusively after the verb exclusively. Such I have often heard include sayings like 

“Hand me that book over yonder,” 

“What are those shadows over yonder?”

“Would you please pass me my keys over yonder?”

While being a common word in Southern talk, it’s not often portrayed in pop culture and standard English, at least from what I can tell. Most recently, I saw this word used in The Green Knight since it is an artifact of older English. Before that in title of the Disney show Wander over Yonder, where the titular character Wander voiced by Jack McBrayer has a southern accent himself.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1628506816,AutoModerator,207

linguistics,I propose a name change for the collective group of supplements and minerals.,"Vitamins, as we all know and love, is a catch all term for supplements and minerals that are *vital* to staying healthy. The etymology of vitamin is as follows:

&gt;vita (latin for life) + amine

The reasoning for this is actually very interesting. Originally, scientists believed that vitamins contained amino acids, which if you’re unaware, are the basic building blocks for proteins, and well, life. This eventually turned out to be false when we learned that not all of these necessary nutrients were amino acids, however, the name stuck. 

Therefore, I propose a new name to replace “vitamin”. 

It is: vitamin

I know, it’s spelled and pronounced the exact same way, however, it is not the same word. 

New vitamin was coined from a more fitting definition of vitamins:

&gt;vital + minerals

It is exactly what our beloved vitamins are, vital minerals. This change is exactly what the English language needs in order to become more sensible to non native speakers. Another positive is the fact that we wouldn’t even have to change the word in any sort of prints or media, we’d only have to change the wikipedia etymology section of vitamin.

How our ability to express them change our understanding and knowledge of that idea? For there are abstract entities that we experience that we have no words for them; we have ineffable, which is a catch-word for everything that we don't have a word for, or we try to express it through comparisons and made-up words (that also rely on comparisons).

Is it that the more you go back, the more primitive/basic (I can't think of a better word right now) the inner world of the 'people' would be, if so, how the ability of language to share complex ideas, through structure and vocabulary, impact and hinders/helps the growing complexity of the inner world?

① What are examples of these phonetic innovations ? (please use the IAST, I can't read Sanskrit written in Devanagari script).

② Is there anywhere i can listen to different hymns/verses both in reconstructed R̥gvedic pronunciation (i.e. as we think their composers would likely have recited them) and in traditional recitation (i.e. as they were later recited in, say, the Śākala Saṃhitā) ? I'd like to get a sense of the difference.

③ How did we (i.e. moderns) figure out the Śākala Saṃhitā showed these innovations to begin with ?

④ Were the classical grammarians (e.g. Pāṇini) aware of these innovations ? If so, what did they say about them ?

Languages outside this language family, such as Japanese and Korean, attach different morphemes or make use of different conjugation patterns as well as through meticulous choice of words to denote distinct levels of speech, and this isn't even touching on the astonishing ways how many Australian languages have a register of 'avoidance speech' in the presence of a specific relative, constraining a speaker's vocabulary by doing so.

Languages in Southeast Asia such as Javanese even have entire different sets of vocabulary (three, in the case of Javanese) depending on who the speaker is talking towards, resulting the separate registers to be almost mutually unintelligible with each other.

However, from what I know of, I have yet to seen any language that demonstrates different levels of politeness/honorifics through syntactic variation (contrasting styles of word order, unique patterns of forming clauses, etc.), although I do admit that I have yet to be exposed to even the most basic literature on the topic of 'politeness', but I'm just wondering if it is theoretically possible for it to happen or not and whether this phenomenon has already been demonstrated in specific languages which linguists have researched on so far?",1628166891,PortalandPortal2Rock,36

linguistics,"Is it possible for scholars to know a language enough to translate spoken word to written word, but not enough to translate the spoken word?","For context: in Brandon Sanderson's ""Stormlight Archives"" series, one of the characters ends up speaking an ancient, lost language called dawnchat due to magical reasons. When he does so, he knows what he is trying to say in his native language, so his wife ends up using that information to translate the written works they have that written in dawnchant. Clearly, to do this, she must be able to phonetically translate words spoken in dawnchant to their written form. Considering this language is so old (well over 5,000 years old when it was last used), it seems unrealistic to me that she would be able to accurately figure out what words are being spoken, since it would seem likely to me that the script would have changed drastically, and if they knew it well enough to know how to phonetically translate the script, they would probably be close to translating the language as a whole?

linguistics,Translating as a job.,"Hi!

Lately I’ve been researching a lot about translation as a professional carreer. I’ve been very indecisive about the subject, specially since whenever I ask the question: “Should I pursue translation as a job?”, there seems to be very contradictory opinions.

I’ve heard people say they are really well paid, others the opposit. Some have told me that I won’t go far if I only know two languages, mostly because I’m Portuguese, and the only other language that I can safely say that I’m fairly fluent at is English (I hope…). Moreover, some even suggest that in 10 years translating will be a dying job.

I’m split and I don’t know what to think. Today I asked some people in r/portugal what they thought about it, since I wanted to know the perspective from some people in my own country, and let’s just say that the replies were demotivating at best.

The only reason why I even considered this job is because I’m currently studying sciences at highschool. However, since last year I’ve been questioning if I like these subjects enough to find a job related to them. It’s not that I dislike them, I just don’t know if they’re what I want.

Translating was suggested to me by one of my parents acquaintances, at the beginning I didn’t put much thought to the idea. Nonetheless, once I thought more thoroughly about it, it started to become more and more appealing. This happened because I know that I love learning new languages, I don’t particularly like to study the intricacies of the language grammar and vocabulary, but I definitely enjoy to learn them.

In 1 or 2 years I think it’s fairly safe to say that I’ll have achieved proficiency level at English. I was just wondering if I could potentially put one of the only subjects that I excel at to good use.

If some people could give me some advice I’d really appreciate. Thank you very much to those who bothered to read all I had to say.

&gt;The [Divergent Association Task](https://www.datcreativity.com/) is a quick measure of verbal creativity and *divergent thinking*, the ability to generate diverse solutions to open-ended problems. The task involves thinking of 10 words that are as different from each other as possible. For example, the words *cat* and *dog* are similar, but the words *cat* and *book* are not. People who are more creative tend to generate words that have greater distances between them. These distances are inferred by examining how often the words are used together in similar contexts. Still, this task measures only a sliver of the complex process of creativity. See the [frequently asked questions](https://www.datcreativity.com/faq) for more details.  
&gt;  
&gt;We have validated this task on around 9,000 participants from 98 countries across the world. People who score higher on the task tend to be able to:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- think of novel and more varied uses for common objects (Alternative Uses Task)  
&gt;  
&gt;\- find associations between related words (e.g., *giraffe* and *scarf*; Bridge-the-Associative-Gap Task)

Proposal A connects 7 families and 3 isolates, which are located in 6 different non-neighbouring regions, spread across 2 neighbouring continents. Most of the populations who speak these languages have different origins, with little or no archeological and genetic evidence in favour of a connection between them. In contrast, there are numerous possible cognates between the languages, and some grammatical and phonological similarities too.

Proposal B also connects 7 families and 3 isolates, located in 6 regions (of which 4 are neighbouring each other), spread across 2 neighbouring continents connected by land and sea. Almost all of the populations who speak these languages share a common origin, with archeological and genetic evidence in favour of a connection between them. These languages also have some grammatical and phonological similarities, but (differently from those of Proposal A) they have less possible cognates, also because some of the languages are extinct and not extensively attested.

But I think it might be useful to other people, so I'm wondering what format the linguistics community would find helpful.

It consists of:

* The 161 Koine Greek nouns (with their case and gender)
* Manual translations of those lemmas into English with notes
* For each of the 1471 languages, what my software and algorithms suggest is probably the correct translation, and a confidence score about how likely it is to be correct. (Not all languages have translations for all 161 words). Many languages have multiple documents I'm working with, and they don't always agree on the right way to translate a Greek noun.
* Information about the language, mostly extracted from Wikidata (e.g. countries that it is present in, sometimes some grammatical features, some information like that).

What would be useful?

* I can create a sqlite database, but I'm not sure how comfortable everyone is with writing SQL queries to get the data out.
* I can create a spreadsheet for each language with all the information available as columns (so it will be very wide). Or I can create a spreadsheet for each language and document combination. If you would open it in Excel, I think this is the only option.
* I can create one giant spreadsheet that has the whole vocabulary in it in a single sheet, but as I have 5.7million items, this is too large to open in Excel. If you are using Python or R this wouldn't bother you.

linguistics,"Does Jeff Hawkins' 1,000 brain hypothesis solve a mystery in language?","To me, one of the great mysteries in human language is how people are able to hear a word that can have dozens of potential meanings, and effortlessly hear only those meanings that apply in a given sentence, ignoring all other potential meanings. This talent is impressive enough when parsing the difference between everyday expressions, like ""a game of chess"" versus ""the great game of politics."" I find it most impressive when people hear a word used in a wholly novel way, but still understand the relevant meanings. For example, if I write, ""A table of myst floated above the lake,"" you understand that the myst is flat but that it doesn't have table legs. The brain can't have a rule that explicitly states, ""tables have legs except when made of myst,"" since the reader's brain has never seen ""table"" applied to ""myst"" before. I wrote my poli sci undergrad thesis on this subject years ago (as it applies to ""nation"") so have long wondered.

In Jeff Hawkins' book, A Thousand Brains, he offers a model for how the neocortex recognizes objects, and it seems like a great fit for explaining how we parse meaning in this way. I will try to explain the concept briefly.

The neocortex has roughly 150,000 ""columns"": groups of neurones arranged vertically. Cortical columns have roughly the same architecture everywhere in the cortex, so it seems like the whole cortex functions by the same underling logic. 

He proposes that each column models objects (and everything else), with each focusing on different aspects. So, when you feel a mug with your hand and recognize that it's a mug, one column focuses on its texture, another focuses on its shape, and so on. He argues that when we touch a mug, the sensory input is distributed to all relevant columns, and those columns send signals for every potential object that would match that sensory input: maybe it's a computer mouse, or a porcelain doll, etc. However, signals only get amplified if all the columns agree that the sensory input matches a given object. So, if its shape matches a computer mouse but its texture does not, the computer-mouse signal is dampened. The only interpretation that remains is the one that matches every column's input. The brain therefore eliminates thousands of potential wrong interpretations through a horizontal kind of voting, and comes up with the right interpretation with amazing speed. 

This gets pretty interesting when applied to words. When I write, ""A table of myst floated above the lake,"" various columns highlight the potential meanings of ""table"" and ""myst."" Some columns (or maybe parts of columns) may send a signal for ""table legs,"" but the columns that model ""myst"" do not match ""legs"" and so the ""leg"" signals get dampened. Only the meanings that match both ""table"" and ""myst"" survive the process, and we effortlessly understand the relevant meanings.

His theory has a long ways to go. But if something like this is true, it sure would offer insight on how humans parse words — with all their dozens of potential connotations and family resemblances — into obvious meaning, even when the words are used in entirely novel ways. It would provide a much clearer model for how this works than tortuous rules-based explanations or vague statistical notions.  It would be awesome if a linguist could collaborate with his research institute to hone the idea.",1627926558,Tristan_Cleveland,52
linguistics,I need a software/website to convert speech into IPA,"Hello there!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm entering my first year of master's degree of English (I'm French) and I'm really into linguistics, particularly phonology. Therefore, I plan to do my dissertation on the errors late French bilinguals may make when speaking English. To do so, I'll be needing something that helps me convert samples of speech into IPA, but I must admit I have no idea of what software could help me in that...

linguistics,I tried making the current spelling of English regular,"I like playing around with the English language, trying to fix one of the major problems it has: the completely irregular spelling. I did this a few times, six in total, and the first five were based on the pronunciation of words (the General American in particular). This of course couldn't work, because in English you reduce unstressed vowels, so ""photo"" and ""photographer"" had different roots. Then yesterday I tried changing the current way of spelling English instead of making a new one, and I came up with an interesting system whose goal was to apply some existing rules to everything, remove other rules, make new ones and cover pretty much most of the English sounds. This is far from being perfect of course, but I think it's a nice start.

If you have any suggestions (as it doesn't include every single sound, as of now), write them in the comments.

Also, if I got something wrong, tell me.

Will it ever be adopted? No, probably not, it may be that some group of people will start writing this way, but I don't think it'll be ever approved officially.

Is using K for the hard sound and C for the soft sound a good idea? I guess so, maybe not if you think of the current C+A/O/U and C+E/I system based on the Romance languages system and you're not used to this one.

Will someone hate this attempt? For sure.

Here's the list of rules:

""L"" stands for ""letter""

""C"" stands for ""consonant""

""V"" stands for ""vowel""

The letter or group of letters after ""→"" indicates how to write the sound preceded by it. If it's part of an example (the ones between parentheses), it indicates the respelled word for the standard English word.

Okay so I’m kinda confused in using this phrase. 

Does, for example, “soldier turned criminal” describe a soldier who turns into a criminal? Or does it describe a criminal who turns into a soldier? 

Because my brain kinda jives with the latter interpretation as it kinda views the phrase as “soldier-turned criminal”, and “soldier-turned” kinda implies that the character is now a soldier. But I’m not sure if this the intended interpretation of the phrase and I’ve only ever heard people use this phrase in a different manner. With “soldier turned criminal” the phrase would indicate a criminal who turns into a soldier, going by how I often see it used.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1627902020,AutoModerator,207
linguistics,I need to make a word for a political phenomena,"Disaster comes to mind, but we'll get to that.

When a group of people revolts to have a government owned by the workers is called something like communism. When they start to plan the economy, it becomes socialism. When they install their chosen dictator they still call it socialism, but it's in fact an autocracy. With sufficient indentitarian violence we call it fascism.

That is a progression. I am making the claim that that is all the parts of one thing. What would you call it?  It seems to be sufficiently complex that it needs a name. The ideology tat spawns it might be called Marxism or Communism or Leninism, but the events (violent revolution, re-establishment of power, mass extermination of the unmentionables in the middle and lower class, transition to autocracy within months or weeks) happen enough that I feel like there needs to be a word for it or even just two.

Do we have something like that? Like... Proletariat Armageddon? It's not quite a cycle because it usually lasts a long time if the dictator stays alive, but it's a moment where stability is en mass sabotaged and then you wind up in a dictatorship via Communistic argumentation and military action.

I’m not sure if this is the type of question you answer but I was hoping to get some advice about potential career paths for my friend. I’d love to hear about where linguistics has taken others and what (if any) jobs you think may suit her. 

She has never studied phonetics or linguistics but can immediately repeat words she’s never heard before perfectly. She can also explain where your tongue and lips should be and where the sound should be in your throat. She can tell what’s wrong with the position of your mouth when trying to pronounce certain words without even seeing you. This is with words and noises that don’t exist in the languages she speaks. She seems to be able to hear sounds that I can’t. 

In addition to English, she speaks 2 languages fluently, 1 at conversation level.. What stands out to me is that she’s learned these languages in Australia, has never been to the countries of origin, but native speakers have mistaken her as being from their country. Her pronunciation is perfect, she understands colloquialisms and double meanings. 

There are probably other things she can do I haven’t even picked up on, I know she can read philosophy from any period and seems to immediately understand their intent.

I have a problem regarding the possessive 's.


In my course I just couldn't clearly understand whether the possessive 's is a form of inflection or not.

But in the summarizing handout it listed the 's as a form of inflection...

I already googled the problematic but I just couldn't find a clear answer.

To me as a German, that felt weird, because in **German**, we just use the adjectives hard and soft synonymous to voiceless and voiced.  
In **English**, as I understand it, the letters &lt;c&gt; and &lt;g&gt; are called hard when they are pronounced \[k\]/\[g\] and soft when pronounced \[s\]/\[dʒ\].  
And in languages with palatalization like **Russian** and **Irish**, I think I have heard palatalized consonants called soft and non-palatalized ones called hard.

The language with the name *Kåltschpræk* of our Germanic tribe has the word *Schtroum ""river""* written down in old scripts written by mainlanders*,* but nobody knows what it means nowadays, because on the Island are no rivers.

2. How to make the same sound yourself (required)
3. Explanation of what “fricative”, “voiceless vs voiced” means (preferred)

linguistics,What Arabic speakers tell me about pharyngealised consonants and what Wikipedia tells me don’t match and I don’t understand why.,"Years ago, I was studying Arabic and the teacher was trying to explain what differentiated dāl and ḍād. His explanation, translated into technical terms, was that ḍād is an interdental consonant. This surprised me, because I had understood (from Wikipedia) that the phonologically relevant difference was that ḍād is pharyngealised.

Remembering this interaction, I had the opportunity today to ask an Egyptian coworker about Arabic phonology. And when I asked him to try to explain the difference in what the mouth is doing when pronouncing these sounds, he gave the same explanation as my erstwhile teacher. But he also said, when I presented my own pronunciation of ḍād (which is pharyngealised and alveolar) that my pronunciation was very good, and that I shouldn’t change anything about it, whatever it was that I was doing (I tried to explain pharyngealised consonants, he didn’t really seem to follow).

This isn’t an Egyptian thing. I don’t remember where my teacher was from but I remember he specifically denigrated Egyptian food as too garlicky, and related a story once of seeing a friend getting blown up by a car bomb (which the coworker says indicates Iraq or Syria).

So this leaves me a bit confused. I am inclined to believe that what Wikipedia indicates (that the phonologically relevant difference is pharyngealisation) is correct, but this seems to leave me in the odd position of claiming that at least some native Arabic speakers are wrong about how some of the sounds of their own language are pronounced.

The person “just saying” something finds it awkward to come out and say, “It is important to me that my feelings are considered when making decisions about where to eat.” So, they meekly conceal their feelings with “just saying.”

The term has been around for awhile but it has become more and more popular and is more often used by people who have less perceived power in a situation. Maybe its rise reflects a growing sense of powerlessness among young people, an aversion to conflict, and a love of ironic humor.

linguistics,"""Ass"" as a postpositive particle","I'd like to discuss a really interesting development in colloquial American English. I think this originated in AAVE and is still most prominent there. Maybe this construction has been around there for years and I just never picked up on it, but anecdotally it does seem to be popping up more frequently.  

So we're all familiar by now with ""ass"" being used as a postpositive intensifier of adjectives:

* *That was a* ***long-ass*** *movie.* 
* *I just heard a* ***loud-ass*** *bang outside.* 

Then there's a related usage I come across occasionally where the \[adjective + ass\] essentially creates a noun from the adjective : 

* ***Inconsiderate-ass*** *didn't even wish me a happy birthday.* (NOTE: this is not the same as ""inconsiderate ass,"" where ""ass"" is a noun instead of a postpositive particle. The stress sounds completely different. The speaker here isn't calling the other person an ass, they're simply calling them ""person or thing who is inconsiderate."" 

Now for the really interesting construction – could this have evolved from one of the previous two? The ""ass"" postpositive particle freely absorbs whole sentences to turn them into modifiers. Below is sourced from a screenshot of a text message conversation I saw online, edited slightly for presentability: 

* Person A: *You good bro? Just checking on you.* 
* Person B: *Oh shut up. Ole positive* ***let me check on a n\*\*\*a's well being-ass*** *n\*\*\*a. Get outta here.* 

I find the above incredibly interesting because from what I can tell, up until this was developed, English syntax had nothing like this (please correct me if I'm wrong). Having studied some Indo-Aryan languages for a bit, the development of ""ass"" is reminding me more and more of the *waalaa* particle found in Hindustani and Punjabi – a super versatile postpositive particle that often acts like a modifying adjective but can encompass whole phrases within its scope: 

* ਪਾਕਿਸਤਾਨ ਵਿੱਚ ਇਹ ਸਭ ਤੋਂ ਵੱਧ ਬੋਲੀ ਜਾਣ ਵਾਲੀ ਬੋਲੀ ਹੈ। 
* Pakistan-in 3.sg **all-from more speak.perfective go.infinitive \[waalaa\]** language is. 
* In Pakistan it is **the most-spoken** language. 

It could be interesting to see how this evolves, as it already seems pretty versatile. Any thoughts? Have any of you noticed this or any other cool usages of this particle or something similar?",1627543668,thirddegreebirds,64

linguistics,Etymology of sardinian pisittu and missittu?," I am very interested in these 2 words, I wish to know their etymology. How were they formed? Are they some onomatopoeias or they are simply derived from some vulgar latin words?

  The main reason why I question this is because my language (romanian) has the word pisica for cat and motan for male cat (which looks like the french word for it, matou). It is quite interesting that the latin word for cat is present in aromanian, a latin based language from the balkans (cat=catusha). Catusha is still found in romanian but with another meaning, handcuffs. 

  The most reasonable theory for me is that it comes from some turkish language, for many years the romanians were under the political influence of the cumans, pechenegs, bulgars and ottoman turks so it is reasonable to suppose that it comes from some turk word. In turkmen it is pisik. Other forms can be found in many indo-european languages.

Before \[i\] and \[j\] all the sounds are palatalised, as far as I understand, but before the back vowel there can also be a palatalised labial, depending on the text, as in \[pʲasɛk\]. But other authors transcribe \[pʲjasɛk\] or \[pjasɛk\]. Does anyone know whether these sounds are assumed to be phonemes or allophones?

linguistics,Communication gap between generations,"Hi all! 

I recently came across the peculiar fact that ellipsis, i.e. the three dots ""..."" at the end of a sentence, are perceived differently by the older and younger generations. 

For example, after sending in a lengthy piece of work, your superior replies: *""Thanks... Great Work..."".* 

Millennials/Gen Z would take this as a red flag, and they would be asking themselves what they've done wrong. Whilst Baby Boomers or Gen X would simply use the ellipsis as a filler, in place of a comma to indicate a casual conversation. 

I thought this was super interesting!  I'm curious to know if you guys noticed any other examples (other than the ellipsis) of such a written (or other) communication gap between generations.

I'm not a linguist, but these two questions have been lingering on my mind for some time. I find the reconstruction of these Proto-languages, but also just poorly attested ancient languages, to be fascinating.   


Especially PIE and Proto-Germanic are interesting to me, since PIE is the ancestor of all languages I speak/learn, and Proto-Germanic the ancestor of my native Dutch. However, I have no idea how accurate they actually are, or how sure we are about them. I know pretty much nothing on the process, so I figured I'd ask here.

In Ireland there are 32 counties all with distinct accents, phrases, vocabulary, but not grammar. Why isn't the English in these 32 counties given their own dialect status?

The Igbo language for example, if you look on Wikipedia ( I understand it may be seen as an unreliable source), it lists the dialects of Igbo, and the names of the dialects are all names of villages in the area it is spoken. I thought, that must mean every village speaks a unique dialect of Igbo, therefore there is a separate dialect for every village, but that is not true apparently, as there are many more villages that do not appear to have their own dialects on Wikipedia.

linguistics,What exactly are the fixed stages of language learning according to SLA theory?,"Dear all, 

So according to Second Language Acquisition researchers, human beings learn languages according to fixed stages which are the same for everybody. E.g. I remember Bill VanPatten mentioning that the singular is ALWAYS learned before the plural [after minute 54 in this video https://youtu.be/vsX7ADtB2Pg ]. 

I recall Krashen making a similar case, i.e. that it is futile to ""learn"" and ""correct"" (consciously) say the instrumental case, when you haven't yet ""acquired"" it (subconsciously). And if you haven't acquired the instrumental case yet, this is only because your level of proficiency hasn't reached the stage where it's ready to incorporate said instrumental case within its subconscious map of the language. 

Long story short: there are certain fixed stages of language acquisition. My question is: What EXACTLY are these stages? 

When I look around on the internet, I find e.g. that babies start ""recognising words at 9 months"" or that they start ""babbling loose words"" at X months. But this is not what I should like to know. I want to know the EXACT stages of syntax/morphology/grammar that learners go through according to SLA-theory. E.g. the singular always comes before the plural. What about tenses? What about verb modes? Does the imperative come before the indicative? Where do pre-/postpositions come in?

I remember that when I was in school we were being taught the ""Have you got"" version only, as in ""Have you got a pen for me?"". Back then I gained the impression that ""Do you have"", at least in British English, was considered informal and that we as students would be encouraged to use the former construction. After graduating from high school, however, I felt like the ""Do you have"" version was in fact much more common in almost every area where I came in contact with English (social media, interviews, meme culture). In 2018, I spent 10 months as an exchange student in the US (Huntsville, Alabama) and kind of felt like there was virtually no use of the ""Have you got"" version at all.

For example “I’m going to the office.” However, there seems to be a group of nouns where this formula is ignored and the article is deleted before the place name. The set of such nouns seems to be very limited. These are the examples I could think of:

Go to bed
Go to sleep
Go to work
Go to school/university/college/class
Go to church
Go to practice
Go to rehearsal
Go to heaven
Go to hell
Go to space
Go to sea (maybe?)
Go to base
Go to Kansas (or any other proper noun)
Go to jail
Go to prison
Go to court

And then there’s this one word where you don’t need the preposition or the article:

Go home

Also, there is a similar interaction that happens with these words and the prepositions “in” and “at.” When these prepositions are present, no article is required. Interestingly, it seems that the list of nouns above can be divided into three classes. One class can only be paired with “in”, one class can only be paired with “at”, and the final class can be paired with either.


I’m at work
I’m at home
I’m at sea
I’m at base (maybe)
I’m at Mount Olympus [or other proper nouns that don’t have large borders or areas maybe?]

I’m in bed
I’m in jail
I’m in prison

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

linguistics,'Strong features are phonologically indigestible',"I posted this earlier in the Q&amp;A thread but got no replies, so I thought I'd bump it up here. My apologies if it's inappropriate for the main subreddit.

I'm working through Norbert Hornstein, Jairo Nuñes, and Kleanthes K Grohmann's *Understanding Minimalism* after having worked my way through a few G&amp;B textbooks, and I'm having a little trouble understanding what the phrase in the post title means. I've searched the Net, and only found the phrase in reference to this textbook. Hornstein, Nuñes, and Grohmann say:

&gt;*Strong features are phonologically indigestible* and so must be checked before the grammar splits; weak features, on the other hand, are phonologically acceptable and need only be checked by LF. (p 39, my italics)

I've only encountered the notion of feature strength in passing thus far, but digging into the literature I've been able to find, I think I get the basic idea. What I'm not following is the *causal* relationship ('…and so must be…') driven by some phonological aspect of the feature. As I understand it from other sources, elements with strong features need to get checked within a local configuration derivationally as soon as they appear, leading to movement before SPELLOUT; weak features do not demand immediate checking, so they can stay put in PF &amp; move covertly in LF, courtesy Procrastination. The other material I've been able to find on this seems to treat strength versus weakness as essentially arbitrary.

HNG seem to be saying that there's something phonologically unacceptable about strong features. I can't figure out what that means. How could phonology be at play in D-structure? What kind of rule might determine indigestibility? The metaphor is employed a few more times in the book, but not in a way that clarifies the matter for me. (It's also expanded: '…if strong features aren't checked before the grammar splits, the derivation will gag.')

Can anyone help me understand what's going on here? And if I'm getting some aspect of this wrong, please correct me!

In an experiment, people are put in a social ""vacuum""/isolation. So they may be in a room by themselves. If everyone speaks their native language out loud for a *large* amount of time, will they all eventually speak in a lower state of pronounciation inherent to the language? 

This question is partly inspired by Orwell's notion that language simplifies into 'simple-speak'. However, simple speak largely has to do with interaction in society. Rather, I'm curious if languages break down to a predestined simpler form over time. 

For instance, a vowel sound 'ah', may reduce to grunting noises resembling 'hhehh'. I could argue that over time, people would resort to that grunting as a method which requires minimal effort while still resembling the speech. Or, perhaps the consonant 'p' eventually resembling 'b'. So in that example, people would pronounce 'pack' as 'behk', or 'backpack' as 'behkbehk"".

I'm writing a phonology paper but I'm kinda stuck because there's not much literature on Kuridish phonology.

So I'm asking for help here hoping there's any chance to get a help from a Kurdish expert or a native speaker.

My question is this: In the dialect of Kurdish with the dark ""l"", can the dark l follow a consonant in the middle of a word or morpheme? (e.g. /...C+ɫ.../)

I think this dark l is often romanized as barred l (ł) or double l (ll), and occurs in words like gʊɫ 'flower', which is distinguished from the clear l as in gʊl 'leprosy'(I referred to McCarus 1997, Kurdish phonology in ""Phonologies of Asia and Africa"")

I know that Kurdish has a maximal syllable structure of CVCC. But there's almost no information about the licit word-medial consonant clusters in this language. And I want to exclude cases where lax vowels get deleted as in the superlative suffix /-tɪrin/ is realized as \[-trin\].

linguistics,Has this vowel in Canadian English been studied?,"I haven't kept up with research in English phonology (or linguistics in general tbh) for the last 10 years or so, but when I was following the subject I never saw this vowel mentioned in any descriptions of Canadian English.

(Disclaimer: this is primarily based on my observation of my own speech, so it's not very scientific.)

Canadian English has a merger of the three historic vowels in the low-back corner of the quadrilateral, corresponding to RP  /ɒ/, /ɑː/, and /ɔː/ (lot, father, talk). The merged vowel is realized as \[ɒː\] or \[ɑː\] (rounding seems to be variable). But I've noticed in a few words, which seem to all be foreign borrowings written with &lt;a&gt;, there's a distinct vowel realized something like \[a:\]. It's backer and longer than /a/ (trap). (Canadian English, at least among younger urban speakers, has /a/  instead of /æ/, but that's a different sound change that I know has been described.)

Some words that have this vowel for me: drama, Mach, Bach, llama, macho, nacho. There's even a minimal pair: Mach vs. mock. (Note that words like 'father' or 'palm' with RP /ɑː/ *don't* have /aː/ for me.)

I recall first noticing this vowel when I read what I think was the title of a blog on punctuation called ""The Comma Sutra"" and it took me a second to realize that it was a joke on the ""Kama Sutra"", because the former has /ɒː/ for me whereas the latter has /aː/. Presumably the author was an American who uses /ɑː/ for both.

My hypothesis/guess is that this apparent /aː/ phoneme occurs in words that used to have /æ/ (before the sound change to /a/) in Canadian English, but /ɑː/ in American English, so that /aː/ resulted as a sort of compromise. Though a couple of counter-examples are 'pasta' and 'Mazda', which both have /a/ for me rather than /aː/, even though they have /ɑː/ in American English.

So have any linguists studied this vowel, its social/geographical prevalence, done an inventory of what words it appears in etc.?",1626995539,n0nmanifest,23

linguistics,Recommendations for where to look for (Pre-)Classical/Epigraphic Maya syntax?,"I have recently become interested in becoming more familiar with Mayan syntax. While grammars of the contemporary Mayan languages do usually cover syntax to a greater or lesser degree, I have noticed a paucity of information on the syntax of epigraphic Mayan. The main focus has always been on morphology, probably because it is very readily extracted from the inscriptions and codices. So far of books, papers, handouts etc. I've reviewed:

1. D. Law &amp; D. Stuart's chapter on Classical Mayan in *The Mayan Languages* (2017): only a handful of terse pages on syntax.
* D. Law's *A grammatical description of Early Classical Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions* (2006): one paragraph
* I. Calvin's *Maya hieroglyphics study guide* (2004): nothing
* J.K. Josserand &amp; N. Hopkins' *Workbook for a short course on Mayan hieroglyphic writing* (2011/2nd ed.): some scattered information, a total of maybe two pages' worth of text
* H. Kettunen &amp; C. Helmke's *Introduction to Maya Hieroglyphs* (2019/16th ed.): one paragraph
* S. Johnson's *Translating Maya Hieroglyphs* (2013): two pages
* А. Daveltshin &amp; A. Lacadena's *Grammar of Hieroglyphic Maya* (2013): very short, scattered snippets, not more than a page's worth on genuine syntax.
* M. J. Macri's *A descriptive grammar of Palenque Mayan* (1988): a solid 25 pages of syntax, but with a dialectological/comparative investigation of complementisers, and suffering from age somewhat.
* D. Mora-Martín's *The grammar, orthography, content, and social context of Late Preclassic Mayan portable texts* (2001): some 15 pages of text with a classification of independent clauses that appear on portable items.

Most of these are offhand remarks or short references to the elementary word order of an independent clause, and only #1 and #8 give a (however brief) overview of subordination/relativisation. Furthermore, only #1 talks about argument fronting, and even then very tersely.

Am I missing something? Is this really a field that has genuinely not been explored practically at all? I don't know enough Spanish to have searched through sources in that language, so I have probably not come across works on epigraphic Mayan in it—but I doubt that the English sources would just not reference that at all.",1626872310,Gassus-Hermippean,4

linguistics,What are the real voiceless consonant aspiration rules for English?,"A bit of background: I'm a non-native English speaker. I could say I understand English pretty comfortably and have been able to do so for a few years now. Buuut one aspect that I still need to work on is my pronunciation. I'm a native Spanish speaker, and trying to improve my English pronunciation is what got me into linguistics in the first place.

Anyway... I think somewhere along the way I unconsciously picked up the /t, p, k/ aspiration. But given that recently I've been working on other parts of my pronunciation (mainly the vowels), I decided to search for the ""proper"" rules for the aspiration of these consonants.

According to a large number of sources (I've seen it practically everywhere), they are as follows:

1. They are aspirated when at the beginning of a stressed syllable 
2. They are unaspirated when at the beginning of an unstressed syllable
3. They are unaspirated when at the end of a word
4. They are unaspirated when they come after /s/

So far so good, right? I noticed I do follow these rules. Pot = [pʰɒt], lucky = [lʌ.ki], stop = [stɒp].

But then I stumbled upon the word ""potato"". Such a simple and basic word, but it's giving me an accent crisis right now. 

Potato has three syllables right? /pə'teɪ.təʊ/. The middle one is the one that's stressed, so it's the only one that should be aspirated, right? 

Wrong. According to [Wiktionary](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/potato), my own speech (which may or may not be right) and the million times I've heard the word, the third and final syllable also has an aspirated [tʰ]. 

So instead of being [*pə'tʰeɪ.təʊ], as the ""rules"" would predict, it's actually [pə'tʰeɪ.tʰəʊ].

So what gives? Am I missing something here? Did I forget something? Are there caveats to these rules?",1626830753,PsycakePancake,34

linguistics,Search engine over 370M YouTube subtitles (Automatic and Manual) in over 100 languages,"Hello,

I've built a website https://filmot.com which is a search engine over YouTube videos and subtitles and allows searching in more than a 100 languages. You can look up phrases, listen to pronunciation by different people and find videos with specific language subtitles. 

The basic functionality is to find videos where a specific word or phrase is said in the subtitles. For example:
https://filmot.com/search/tropicore/1
https://filmot.com/search/%22from%20russia%20with%20love%22/1?

You can also limit the result by channel country, category, view count, channel, publish date and other parameters.

If you wish to search automatic subtitles (this covers the languages: Russian, Spanish, Dutch,English,French,German,Indonesian,Italian,Japanese,Korean,Portuguese,Turkish,Vietnamese) click the ""Automatic Subtitles"" button, for other languages click ""Manual Subtitles"", this covers all the manually submitted subtitles (which may or may not correspond to the actual language of the video)

If the result is not in your intended language open the Filter Languages on the left and click your intended language/Channel country. (This is a design compromise otherwise you would have to select a language every time you search which might have been cumbersome).

It can be useful to understand colloquial usage when searching for particular phrases, expressions or pronunciation.

There are a few other options like searching videos that have subtitles in certain languages, for instance videos that have only English and Russian subtitles.
https://filmot.com/captionLanguageSearch?titleQuery=&amp;channelID=&amp;captionLanguages=en%20ru%20&amp;capLangExactMatch=1&amp;

If you click the flag the captions will display in different languages side by side for simultaneous translation. 

If you are a person who is triggered by flags you can turn flags off in the settings page. (I was banned from /r/Spanish for having the Spanish Flag represent the Spanish Language)

Feel free to suggest research ideas or reach out to me in regards to stuff that could be done on this corpus. I expect something useful could be done with this data and it would likely be useful for research.
I am also open to additional search/filtering requests that you may find useful.

Clarification on captions:
In YouTube there are two types of captions, automatic captions which are generated by YouTube with their speech to text system. (These are mostly correct but not always and some times don't even detect the language correctly or have poor quality due to poor sound or poor pronunciation) and manual subtitles submitted by the video owner (or before 2020 a volunteer contributor). The manual subtitles can be in the original audio language or in a different language. I don't have a sure way to determine if the manual subtitles match the audio language but I've implemented the ""manual"" search on my site with a heuristic approach, basically by default it only shows videos which only have 1 manual subtitle or has automatic subtitles in the language that matches the manual subtitles (and only that language is searched) In the hope that these manual subtitles match the audio.

linguistics,"Similar words to ""Moist"" in other languages.","My question isn't quite technical so it may be a bit odd for this subreddit.

For those who are unaware, in the English language the word ""Moist"" has an odd effect on a number of the population for reasons entirely unknown. In addition to some people not being affected, it was shown that words like ""Hoist"" and ""Foist"" did not invoke the adverse reaction and that changing the context of the word to indicate moist as a positive trait (such as a moist cake) also did not change the way people felt about the word.

My question is if there are words with similar effects in other languages and if those words have any similarity to the word ""Moist.""  
I want to make it clear, I'm not asking for words that sound like or words that mean something similar to ""Moist."" I'm looking for any word in any language that makes a certain subsection of the population uncomfortable for no apparent reason.",1626803585,Thorne-In-Your-Side,86
linguistics,How on Earth do you pronounce PIE for Tongue/Language: *dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s,"A similar question has been asked before on Reddit, but does not answer what I want properly.

How do you pronounce the Proto-Indo-European word for 'Language' or 'Tongue',  **\*dn̥ǵʰwéh₂s**. I wouldn't mind an IPA transcription or something, because, damn- the Proto-Indo-Europeanists are a real weird bunch of Linguistics. 

Apparently because they begun constructing PIE before the IPA had been made, they use a different system of transcripting PIE words. 

According to what I found, the second letter is not a voiceless n (alveolar nasal), despite having a voiceless diacritic- but in fact the diacritic used represents that the n is syllabic, even though... syllabic consonants use a... different diacritic? Idk, PIE Linguists are weird.

&amp;#x200B;

\[ɹ\] and \[l\] --&gt; \[w\] 

\[θ\] --&gt; \[t\] or \[f\]

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1626692419,AutoModerator,257

For the latter two I guess this makes sense since the proto language is reconstructed with the same word order and so any earlier word order would be hard to determine.

I have recently left nursing school and returned to the university I did my prerequisite work at. I am now trying to decide on a major. Linguistics came to be of interest to me when I was looking into majors that I could apply my 2 years of Japanese to. 

I am really interested in language and how it works, and I have also considered one day going the SLP route, but that is something to worry about in the future.

I also have access to online classes that teach SQL, Python, etc, for free (as a perk of being a student at my uni).

linguistics,Smart writers should write words borrowed from Latin in their correct Latin forms,"Long time ago, Americans did a good thing by changing the spelling of *-our* to *-or* in words such as *colour*, *flavour*, etc. The reformed American spelling is more correct etymologically; it is the Latin spelling, whereas the *-our* spelling is the Old French spelling; and of course, the reformed American spelling is simpler and more economic. Every time you write *color* instead of *colour*, you save one byte of memory, or possibly more than one byte if you are using an encoding such as UTF-16.

Unfortunately, however, it seems that the spelling reform movement stopped there. English is still filled with Latin words that are misspelled under the influence of Old French.

In my opinion, spelling reform does not need to wait until some decree is issued by some authority somewhere. We currently live in the information age. It will only take you a few seconds to find out what an etymologically correct spelling should be. People writing on social media, blogs, etc. should try and spell Latin words in their etymologically correct forms.

One good place to start is to abandon the spelling *-ous* in favor of the more correct spellings *-us/-os*. For example, instead of writing *continuous*, *ambiguous*, *ridiculous*, etc., smart people should write *continuus*, *ambiguus*, *ridiculus*, etc. Instead of *religious, fabulous, poisonous*, etc., they should write *religios, fabulos, poisonos*, etc..

What can possibly happen if you use the correct Latin spellings? I don't think there will be any misunderstanding. People will know what you mean. Nobody should be able to criticize you for using a spelling that is more correct and more efficient.",1626639007,HD86000,1

But I was raised as a kid in America, went to school there, spoke in English with my brother and cousins, and when I eventually returned to my home country, I kept using English and etc. I did look on Wikipedia for the criteria that linguists use to classify a native speaker:

1. The individual acquired the language in early childhood and maintains the use of the language.
2. The individual has intuitive knowledge of the language.
3. The individual is able to produce fluent, spontaneous discourse.
4. The individual is communicatively competent in different social contexts.
5. The individual identifies with or is identified by a language community.
6. The individual does not have a foreign accent.

linguistics,Question about accents/dialects on different regions in the United States.,"Hopefully these questions can be answered here, they are two totally different stories.


1.) I’m a Californian (born and raised) and I have a standard American accent. I just got back from a week trip from the Deep South, specifically Mississippi and Alabama, where I met one of my moms old friends from California. This lady was born and raised in California, she attended college in Alabama. Her accent is southern, not heavy, but definitely noticeably southern! I was shocked when my mom told me she went all throughout grade school and high school with this woman because she has a southern accent.


Is it possible to pickup an accent if you live in an area for so long? I might go to college in Alabama or Mississippi and end up living there afterwards, I cannot imagine myself with a southern accent. It was kinda trippy to hear her talk knowing she was born and raised in California.


2.) As stated, I’m a Californian. My parents were both born and raised in California, as were all my grandparents too. However, my dads parents have this weird accent/dialect (idk what the difference is) with the way they say certain words.

For example, the days of the week. My parents and I pronounce Monday as “Mun-day” however, my grandparents pronounce it as “Mun-dee”. Kinda weird, instead of “day” they pronounce it “dee”. This goes for all days of the week.

Another example is the word potato. My parents, I and most people would say “puh-tay-tow” however, my grandparent would pronounce it something like “puh-tay-tuh”. They use an “uh” instead of the “oh” sound.

My grandparents were born in 1940, not sure if that would have anything to do with it. My grandpas mother’s side of the family was from Kansas,Missouri,Indiana and moved to Bakersfield, Ca in the 1930s, they were part of the dust bowl migration. His fathers side was from California.

I have a Bachelor's in English Language Teaching. The problem is I have a stutter, moderate-to-severe one, since my early childhood. This causes me to receive almost no positive response from most of the educational instititutions who interviewed me for teaching jobs in my country. I tried speech therapy twice with two different therapists. The benefits were only of the short-lasting type, unfortunately. Therefore,  I'm thinking of changing my sector. I didn't want to be a teacher at all from the beginning anyways. 

Currently, I'm doing an MA on psycholinguistics. I'm also thinking of doing a PhD, which means I have to start earning my own money after some point. So, here are my questions.

linguistics,"Why are l (L), n, m and r not vowels?","I've been getting into music and so I've been thinking a lot about sound and wondering what distinguishes each of the vowels from one another, and questioning why I can seem to put a vowel name on various bird calls from crows despite our different vocal structures. 

While doing so I've found there seems to be a useful core distinction between harmonic and non-harmonic sounds, with all of our harmonic sounds just having different overtones being resonated/dampened (which is how we distinguish between them) and non-harmonic sounds being quite distinct. This satisfied my questioning of why I wanted to describe bird calls with letters, but I feel like if anything, shouldn't being harmonic be what distinguishes vowels from consonants?

I've heard the controversy behind y/j, and maybe w, but why am I not hearing controversy behind l, r, n, and m to name a few? Are l and r really as distinct from o as o is from p? 

Also, if all we were taught is the language, without being meta-taught about the various letters from a young age, would we really still think that w was a consonant? Like I think we could easily have treated 'o' how we treat w, but that's my bookend mini-rant.",1626431101,Five_High,28

Hello everyone! My name is Lizzy Naughton, and I am a linguistics student at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, and I'm looking for participants for my study about international gaming culture.

The study will be about how people learn new languages and skills because of their investment into MMO/MMORPG culture. Virtual reality, role play scenarios, immersive storylines, and interaction within the game and outside of the game all all factors that make the MMORPG community ideal for learning complex skills, particularly communicative language skills. My study will aim to be an **ethnographic investigation** into online gamer culture, specifically for those who are gamers who are non-native English speakers playing in a primarily English-speaking environment.

My background is of someone who loves studying linguistics, and who also loves observing how online culture and what gaming culture is changing younger generations.

All I will need is to conduct some personal interviews within the span of 4-5 months, and permission to observe your chat interactions in communicative platforms such as discord, reddit, etc. (This platform will depend on the participant.) The interviews will last no longer than an hour, and I will only need up to three interviews. **All names/ personal information will be kept anonymous.**

I am specifically looking for participants who are 19-years-old and older, who play an MMORPG regularly, and who do not speak English as a native language. English proficiencies do not have to meet a certain standard, but you have to interact in-game or online in *mostly* English.

The study will begin within August. The end goal is to have a **collection of opinions and experiences from non-native English speakers about their experiences as gamers**. What do you like about the community? How do you feel about your English? **We also want to have linguistic observations about how players communicate and chat in discussion-based forums,** looking for signs of code-switching, use of multiple kinds of English dialects, etc.

Please, help me out and reach out!! This will be an interesting and worthwhile experience. The study will help future researchers to understand the nature of MMORPGs and the MMORPG community in the context of globalization, internet culture, and youth culture.

But, I'm leaving this country baby! And I'm going back to my home country of New Zealand.

So, I was wondering what else can I do with the qualifications that I have? I'm halfway through a Ph.D. in foreign language education as well and when I'm back in New Zealand, I'm pretty sure there will be less of what I'm doing now (a university position) and more of .... other things!

So that's my question, what are the other job opportunities out there for people in our field? What are you guy's doing with your qualifications in linguistics? And most importantly, which jobs pay the most?! I've got kids to feed!

linguistics,Antivocative articles,"I was reading--as one does--about Westrobothnian on Wikipedia, the Swedish variety spoken in the province of Västerbotten and that includes this small section:

&gt;The pleonastic article is widespread among languages in the area, as far north as Troms. A pleonastic article, marking the opposite of the vocative, is put before people's names, pets' names, and words denoting the immediate family. The masculine form is n, and the feminine form is a. For example; “father is home” is n far jär hæ̀im’. In dative, n becomes om or o, e.g. ɒt om Jɒ̀nk’ “to John”.

I'm not sure why it's called 'pleonastic'. The word itself links to the article *Dummy pronouns*, but this seems like a separate phenomenon to me. Firstly because it's an article and not a pronoun, and secondly because it doesn't seem to agree with the definition there at all: *""fulfills a syntactical requirement without providing a contextually explicit meaning of its referent.""* (It *doesn't* fulfil a syntactical requirement, and *does* provide contextual meaning. Right?)

So, I feel like calling this usage the 'antivocative' (case?). And thinking about it there seems to be a parallel usage in many types of German (though not necessarily always Standard German), like this:

    Dieter (Vocative)
    Der Dieter (Nominative, antivocative)
    Des Dieters (Genitive, antivocative)
    Dem Dieter (Dative, antivocative)
    Den Dieter (Accusative, antivocative)

In these varieties you wouldn't use an article when speaking to the person (i.e. vocative), but it's more or less obligatory to do so when speaking *about* them. I think that also, in most(?) German varieties that have this usage, the use of the article is more frequent with referents that are more well-known to the speaker (and listener), but I'm not entirely sure of that.

Does that seem right? That the German article before a personal name (or sometimes also kinship terms: e.g. 'Der Papa ist schon daheim') has an 'antivocative' meaning? It's often described as 'redundant'; just as the Westrobothnian article had it as 'pleonastic' (i.e. basically 'redundant' as well). But that characterisation therefore seems wrong to me. 

Of course in some or even most phrasing the usage may still be technically redudant, i.e. when the person isn't present, the fact that it is the most frequent with familiar people, either their names or kinships terms, seems like this could usefully distinguish between speaking *to* or *about* a person.

It seems somewhat extraordinary then, that that would make the vocative the least-marked case, but perhaps it isn't.

Does this usage occur in other Germanic languages/varieties? (Or in languages from other families?)",1626168555,feindbild_,8

linguistics,Survey: which type of multiplication tables did you memorize as a child? (Trust me this is relevant to r/linguistics),"In most of the English speaking world, I've come across two variants of multiplication tables -  
One that accounts for ""phrases"" that have already appeared in a lower table and the other that does not.  
One example, say, you're learning the table of 3. You go 3-1s-are-3... 3-4s-are-12, and so on. When you get to the table of 4, you can have created fresh new phrases like 4-1s-are-4... 4-3s-are-12. Or, you can have reused phrases that you have already memorized before. (let's call this type A)  
  
For the latter, say, with 4's table you repeat things like 2-4s-are-8, 3-4s-are-12 (which are from 2's and 3's tables, respectively) and only after that you start creating new phrases. (let's call this type B)  
  
Please comment with the type that you have learned. More details below (if you're interested).  
  
The latter is much more efficient in terms having to rote-memorize new stuff, and has a better ""random lookup time"", as we computer scientists call it. I'm trying to research better methods of teaching young children in a variety of subjects.

That all made me wonder, is there any consistent semantic content to zero-derivations at all, or could - if we knew nothing about English or English-speaking cultures - ""to boat"" have any verbal meaning that might be associated with boats?

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1626087615,AutoModerator,250

linguistics,Ethnic Generic Singular Names (contains racist content),"This post is about the use of ethnic terms as generic singulars. I've cited some racist content. I don't want to offend anyone: The content is motivated by the nature of the linguistic usage that I'm asking about.

Recent events have brought Gil Scott-Heron's classic poem '[Whitey on the Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goh2x_G0ct4)' to mind, &amp; that in turn got me thinking about a phenomenon in English I've wondered about a couple times over the past few years: Intuitively it seems to me that there are a couple of related ways in which English-speakers use ethnic singular terms to refer to something other than individuals:

* In some instances, the singular is used generically to talk about characteristics attributed to all members of the group—eg Raphael Patai's book *The Arab Mind*, or almost any ethnography before the '60s (grabbing the readiest example, '…all the necessities of life are within easy reach of the Trobriand Islander'—Malinowski). This usage tends to be racist, but it also sometimes occurs from people *within* a group: Malcolm X in a 1962 interview with Robert Penn Warren: '…the implication is that the Negro is something distinct or different and therefore needs to learn how to improve himself'. This needn't be ethnic, I suppose: *Time* in 1966 ran an editorial essay on 'The Homosexual in America'.
* In some instances, a generic individual is made to stand in for the population as a whole. Here, I'm thinking of 'the Hun' to refer to Germans during the First World War, or 'the Boer' in 'Kill the Boer', or 'Fuzzy-Wuzzy' in Rudyard Kipling's poem.

I think these bleed into each other, but the core difference I'm getting at is reference to individuals (perhaps all of them) in a group versus referring to a group as an unindividuated whole. When Saint Nihal Singh writes: 'The hide of the Hindoo varies from the dull, pale, sallow-brown of a Mexican to the extreme black of an African.', he is clearly making reference to a variety of individuals despite the singular noun. When Evans-Pritchard writes 'And if the Nuer has no law, likewise he lacks government.', he *can't* be referring to individuals—even generic ones. It is the Nuer as a whole who have or do not have government. The poetaster who writes 'The Jap is at thy gate, England' is well aware that the overwhelming majority of Japanese people are on their home islands, with no intention of leaving. Gil Scott-Heron knows that only a tiny fraction of white people were accepted to the Apollo 11 Mission.

Are there terms for these usages? I haven't been able to find anything by Googling, tho I think it's likely that that's because I haven't been able to think up the right search terms. Is there any literature on this?",1626081524,Pathawi,11

TL;DR: Mainstream theories of syntax make a bizarre prediction: that under certain circumstances, language learners should be able to acquire syntactic structures they've never been exposed to. We designed 3 artificial languages with the properties thought to facilitate this type of acquisition-without-exposure, taught these to participants, and then tested the participants on the structure they hadn't been exposed to. In 4 experiments, learners spontaneously produced the unexposed structure. (For the linguistically savvy: we trained people on different combinations of relative clause types, e.g., subject &amp; indirect object relative clauses, and then tested them on other types, e.g., direct object RCs. Theories with operations like ""movement"" (GB/minimalism) or ""slash categories"" (HPSG) hold that knowledge of 1 RC type amounts to knowledge of all, and therefore predict that people should be able to produce structures they've never heard.) The finding supports the idea of an extra level of abstraction above ""tree structures,"" and is evidence against surface-oriented theories like those espoused by usage-based theories of language acquisition.

Obviously, my friend laughed at me and said I sounded pretentious.  


This got me to thinking about other proper nouns. English speakers say ""Paris,"" and are often considered by others to sound pretentious when they say ""Pa&lt;r&gt;ee."" But with less common places, I would feel ""boorish and uncivilized"" if I pronounced it as ""the Treaty of Troyes"" instead of ""the Treaty of Twuh.""  


Is it simply the case that more culturally significant places get anglicized by exposure? Or is there some other factor affecting it, such as the language of origin?",1626020880,TheMcCleaver,13

linguistics,Should the “speech” used by Sardinian shepherds be considered something of its own?,"I tried asking the same thing in ask linguistics but I didn’t get any answers.

A great introduction to the topic: https://www.google.it/amp/s/www.lanuovasardegna.it/regione/2013/01/16/news/notte-dei-fuochi-i-pastori-parlano-con-gli-animali-1.6359821/amp/ (it’s Italian, there’s no English document regarding this).

Growing up I always heard (and still hear) my grandma call animals (as in calling them to come or to call them to get their attention) in a different way from the name she gives them when talking about them to humans (and the terms weren’t interchangeable, for example: “cat” is /muç/ when called, but /‘gat.tu/ when talked about or in general).
To me that was usual and I didn’t think much about it, even to my mum they were only sounds with no meaning, this until I got interested in linguistics and I started to think about the fact that these sounds were used on specific occasions to define a certain animal rather than another, if you used /muç/ when calling a dog it would be wrong, which is similar the definition of “word”.
Some of its characteristics that differ from Sardinian (and that can also be seen in the article) are:

-one verb time (present) and one mood (imperative) e.g. “pru!” “tru!” (As said in the video) or “tzéule!” (word used in my dialect to tell an animal to shut up, it doesn’t have a infinitive form or a present one, so it’s most likely a word that was also borrowed in normal dialect) vs. Sardinian that has many verbs moods and times

-no marked plural vs. -os/-as in Sardinia

-reduction of words e.g. ervé for erveghe 

-the vocabulary isn’t necessarily related to the Sardinian counterpart, I’m gonna compare 5 words and one verb in the shepherd speech of my dialect and in my dialect:

•muç/ˈmu.çi/mu.çit.ˈteɖ.ɖu-gattu-cat

•ˈti.ka-pudda-hen

•Wɪ/tε/dε (unsure about all of them)-cane/catzeddu-dog

•ʧɔ-porcu/erre,sughe-pig

•tʰɘ̞/tε-erveke-sheep.

•ˈtseule-ista muttu/ muttu- (you) shut up!

Note: the words and the amount of difference between them and true dialect depends from place to place.

So after looking at this I’m here to ask, should it be considered as something on his own, and if yes, as what (dialect, cryptolect, pidgin...)?

What I mean by that is, the spelling for the verb comes from French and the spelling for the noun comes from Latin (there are other examples for this such as enjoin → injunction and possibly pronounce → pronunciation, for which the same question as profundity could be posed).

Etymonline suggests a spelling with ""ou"" never occurred in French, but regardless of whether it did or not, it could have caused the ou/u discrepancy as well as the oin/unct (also found in point/punct). But it also suggests the words originated from French separately, with profound joining the English language with the primary meaning of  ""characterized by intellectual depth, very learned"" whereas profundity was first attested in early 15th century with the meaning ""bottom of the sea"".

The Sardinian language didn't have cases, neither do most of the modern Latin languages. Romans would have manipulated their origin to fake a blood ancestry with Greeks. Also, there would have been a Sardinian history that lasted 4000 years before Roman history, there were some documents in Sardinian, and even Rome and Athens would have been founded by the Sards.

Her ""bark"" was ""get THAT free spin.  Come on over and get THAT free spin"".  Not get ""your free spin"", or ""a free spin"", but ""THAT free spin.""  The usage of ""that"" in this context, has a very informal tone to it.  As if the masses are assumed to be in tune with a ""spin"" being a common enough concept, to deem using ""that"" to describe the spin.  

Another example was when I was on a flight and the stewardess told us to ""check THAT seatbelt"".  Not ""check your seatbelt"".  Again, the usage of ""that"" in this context is in this very informal manner and said in a way, where there's almost an unspoken rule that it's understood that if a person is using ""that"" this way, then there a consensus to converse with the person in an informal manner likewise.

&amp;#x200B;

""never had  Greek (a name that placed Romans), there are ""ellin = illin = illir""; -''illin= illir'' but is with the albanian north dialekt(tribe Dor = gegeni); -Greek language is Albanian (= illire) language with conjunction of words, a phenomenon that occurred at the time of writing (7-3 BC) when the language was written for the first time. What previously was said in a sentence at the time of writing was introduced in a single word.  A few from the latin(roman), greek and russian etymological dictionary(=Pak nga fialori etimologjik mbi greqishten, romaken dhe rusishten). You will see elements of word formation and will understand that is Albanian language(= Illyrian language) that participates in the building of the words of ancient Greek and Latin(Roman). The issue which we have dealt is word formation. Until today, the word is treated as a unity of phonemes or syllables with a certain emphasis. In fact it is not so. The word is a whole sentence with small Albanian(=illire) words that explaining its own word, and that sentence was superimposed in a single word at the time of writing of language (centuries 7-3 BC when is done the writing of the language). So what had been said before in a whole sentence at the time when the language was written is introduced in a single word, and then the Greek and the Roman(latin) were distinguished from illir(= Albanian) language. So albanian is the language that has created other languages, by merging the Albanian(= illire) short words from a whole sentence by summing them into a single word. like:: kallos(=i mire = good) = k - all(ill) - os = k(q) - yll - os = that - star - is = is star, is very good like a star. We and today say: he is yll(star), is very good. With greek it will be: pu - asteri - ine; -but is in albanian language: k(q) - yll - os = q - yll - esh.  example from latin language: gloria(=lavdi = glory) = g(= q) - lo - ri - a = q - la - ry - a = that - ap - enter - is = ryn la, ngrihet la, mburret, i thuret lavdi(=rise ap, enter ap(to the sun), glorify; -with himself latin(roman) language would be: ''qui - sopra - intra - e'';  -as you see, complies is only with Albanian language(=illirian language)  ''g(q) - la - ry - a''. or: example from ancient Greek: ''dramatopios(= ai qe ben drama = he who made drama) = drama - to - pi - os = drama - te - be - esh = drama - to - do - is''. -with Greek language is: ''drama - na - kani - ine '', as you see, complies is only with Albanian language.  As I told you at the entrance, linguistic elements that participate in the word formation from the ancient times are: All the base simple words have in their composition one name of the sun in ancient times, as ''ili, illi, eli, elli, oli, olli, ali, alli, uli, ulli, tili, tilli, teli, telli; dilli, dili, delli, deli; te, teu, teo, deo, die, dio; eri, ori, oni, ini; Asi, Ati; a, au; e, eu; i, iu = y, yu (star; sun); koku; -api, opi, ipi, epi, upi; siri, sari (zari, ziarri); -etc'' build these designations of the sun with all kinds of vowels. Or have one of the qualitis of the sun, like the heights, the distances, etc (designations that comes from itself quality of the sun). In ancient times for Egiptians and for the peoples that had related with Egipt:  ''Dilli(=Apolloni = zoti) = sun(= God)’’. Every base simple word has in compose one of denomination of the Sun in ancient times, or one of elements that are linked to the sun, and a base simple word take sense from the properties of the sun which explains the word that is in analysis.. Likewise, in the construction of the base simple words also participate ancient Albanian verbs 'i, in, ir, is (= hysh; ish); ri, rin, rir // e, en, er, es; re, ren, rer; -etc that are the same verbs but are made with the other vowels = hy, hyn, hyr; ry, ryn, ryr = enter', and from auxiliary verb ''e, es, et, est = is / i, is, it, ist = is; -etc verbs, built with all kinds of vowels, to increase diversity between the words, that the words to be distinguished each from the other. An important role in word-formation have played the nodes 'k; t', especially Albanian node ''k = q, që = that'' which is the base node that supersedes all the consonants when they are in the role of a node (all the consonants take the role of the node when they are in the beginning of a simple word). This node in many cases is associated with different vowels. These words that we said above are tha basic elements for forming of the base simple words, but there are lots of other words and verbs of Albanian language who participate in formation of consisting words. Because(as we said), every word is a whole sentence(is not a simple word). Each base simple word is made up of a whole sentence, and every simple word(in generaly) takes the meaning from a characteristic of the sun (as height, the distance, etc); -or every word has in composed one of virtues of the sun. Shembull(=example): eg: gloria(=lavdi = glory) = g(= q) - lo - ri - a = q - la - ry - a = that - ap - enter - is = ryn la, ngrihet la, mburret, i thuret lavdi(=rise ap, enter ap(to the sun), glorify; -with himself latin(roman) language would be: ''qui - sopra - intra - e'';  -as you see, complies is only with Albanian language(=illirian language)  ''g(q) - la - ry - a''. here ''la'' is a characteristic of the sun(=al, il = dill), and means 'la = al, ill, dill'  that goes up(on high), deep(below) and far (like enters and the  'al = il, dill = sun'), in ancient times it was thinking that was the Sun he that rolling around the Earth. or: candela(=candle, light = kandili, qiri qe ben drite) = k - an(=hyn) - dela(=dili) = q - hyn - dili = hyn dielli, hyn drita = that - enter - dela(=dili = sun) = enter ''sun'', enter the light; -with the roman(=latin) language will be ''qui - intra - sol'' but that is in albanian language ''c - an - dela(=dili) = q - an(=hyn) - dili = that - enters - sun''; -as everywhere complies is only with Albanian language.  or: ''centila(=shkendia = spark) = c - en(=hyn) - til - a = q - hyn - til(=diell) - a = hyn til(=dill, diell), hyn drit, ben drit(dill = diell) = that - enters - dill(=sun) - is = enters sun(=til=dill = diell), enters light, is doing light''; -as everywhere complies is only with Albanian language.  or: dolce, dulce(=ambelsin = sweet) = dol - c - e = dol(=dill=sun) - that - is = sun - that - is = is the sun, is like the sun, it is very good (like the ''sun = dol = dil, diell''). With latin language it will be ''sol - qui - e''; -complies is only with Albanian language.  Example from ancient Greek: ''dramatopios(= ai qe ben drama = he who made drama) = drama - to - pi - os = drama - te - be - esh = drama - to - do - is''. -with Greek language is: ''drama - na - kani - ine '', as you see, complies is only with Albanian language. -and this is for all the words of ancient Greek and Roman.   -or the greek and roman word: latria(=λατρεια(in greek)) = worship; adoration, when you boast someone, you raises him very high = lat - ri - a = lat - ry - a = up(on high) - enter - is = enter up(on high), you boast someone, you raises him veri high(= e ryn lat, e mburr shume, e ngre lat). With Greek language would be: ''latria = apano(= on high) - to benis(to sikonis = to enter) - ine(=is) = apano - to sikonis - ine = on high - to enter - is''; -the word comply only with Albanian ''lat - ri(ry) - a''.   or: kallos(=i mire = good) = k - all(ill) - os = k(q) - yll - os = that - star - is = is star, is very good like a star. We and today say: he is yll(star), is very good. With greek it will be: pu - asteri - ine; -but is in albanian language: k(q) - yll - os = q - yll - esh.  -or: the Russian words ''rodill, rodit = lind, del nga erresira ne diell ose ne dit'' = ry - dill/ ry - dit = enter - sun/ enter - day = enter to the sun, enter to the day, enter to the light = born, emerging from darkness into light''. With today's Russian language would be ''vhodit - na sollncie'', but it is in Albanian language ''ry - dill/ ry - dit(= enter - to the sun / enter - to the day)''.   Russians are Illirian branch that opened up in the Caucasus and in Urals circa 1100-1200 BC, where crucified mainly with Mongols of Siberia.  As you can see, it is precisely this language(= illyrian = albanian) that has helped to create the other languages.  Someone says that I do the game with the sounds to fit the meanings of the words of other languages with the Albanian(= illyrian) language; - but this does not happen with 10 or 100 words; -Albanian(= illyrian) language gives the meanings of all the words. Let them test everyone and give the meaning of those words with an other language, with the Greek or with the Roman(=latin) language. It is impossible, the meaning comes only with Albanian(= illyrian) language. I say Albanian(= illyrian) language, because are exactly the words of today's Albanian: the verbs 'i, in, ir(= hy, hyn, hyr) = enter' and 'ri, rin, rir(= ry, ryn, ryr) = enters', is the auxiliary verb 'e, es, et, t, s, est(=eshte) = is', are the names of illi(=star) and dilli(=sun) and the nodes ""k, t(= qe, te) = that"" constructed with all kinds of vowels that we finds them in the construction of the words of all the languages from the early period. We say ''Albanian(= illyrian)'' because all elements of construction of the Greek and Roman words are elements of Albanian language.""

Well... I'm from Argentina, so I'm a native spanish speaker, and here I come with a dilemma about the slang ""**me voy a ir yendo**"" which **uses the same verb (to go) inflected in 3 different ways**.

*Seh... hablamos como se nos antoja, básicamente...*

It is used for expressing that one is getting out from somewhere (exit), doesn't matter the place, you're just getting out from your house, your work, the school, the square, a shop, etc.

Hi there,

I just joined Reddit so getting used to the platform. I am looking for HELP INTRO TO LINGUISTICS ONLINE QUIZ. I have until tmrw (Thursday, July,8,2021) to attempt and submit it! It'll be 10-15 multiple choice questions and I am willing to pay $15. I'm a non-traditional student that could use a helping hand!

More on the quiz's criteria:

Quiz 2 will be handled exactly like [Quiz 1](https://eclass.yorku.ca/eclass/mod/quiz/view.php?id=738764). You will have until tomorrow before midnight to attempt the quiz. You will get three attempts if you need them but your answers carry over! Each attempt is timed and once you start the quiz you will have 45 minutes to complete your attempt. The last attempt counts. Expect 10-15 questions.

As mentioned in lecture, it is on Transformational Grammar, Semantics, and the first part of Phonetics, i.e., what wasn't on the midterm up to last Wednesdays lecture on Phonetics. That includes the textbook chapter on Semantics—in particular pp 139-154 (Lexical Semantics) and 158-161 (Thematic Roles) which I did not include in lectures but you are still responsible for. (You won't have to draw trees involving transformations or do phonetic transcription. It's purely multiple choice.)

Anyone who can help, please get in touch ASAP!! I suppose you dm me. I'll be happy to share the textbook with you via EMAIL. I don't want to get too caught up trying to figure out Reddit atm.

Also, my uni's student portal has2factor authentication so for that I believe communiating via email would be most efficient - email me when you're about to log on and I'll approve the login attempt from my phone right then.

If I'm happy with your work, I'll hire you to do the remaining problem set and exam for this course as well! :)

Something like ""finish"" as in the paper by Spalek and  Sæbø (2019) I mentioned above. 

Assuming eventualities as a basic type *v* written as e or s (state) and verbs are *&lt;&lt;e,v&gt;,t&gt;* which I will write using P. Assuming a stativizing morpheme like in (i) from Spalek and Sæbø and that this combines with a predicate that involves sub-events as part of its semantics as in (ii) which is the lexical entry for ""finish eating"" from the same paper. 

(i) λPλxλs∃e RESULT(s)(e) ^ P(x)(e)
(ii) λxλe∃e′ eat(x)(e′) ^ FIN(e′)(e) where FIN(e') is true iff e is a final subpart of e' (there is no other subpart of e' which follows e; e is a final subevent of an eating event, e') 

By FA and beta reduction:

i. [λPλxλs∃e RESULT(s)(e) ^ P(x)(e)](λxλe∃e′ eat(x)(e′) ^ FIN(e′)(e))
ii. [λxλs∃e RESULT(s)(e) ^ (λxλe∃e′ eat(x)(e′) ^ FIN(e′)(e)) (x)(e)] iii. [λxλs∃e RESULT(s)(e) ^ (λx∃e∃e′ eat(x)(e′) ^ FIN(e′)(e)) (x)]
iv. [λxλs∃e RESULT(s)(e) ^ (∃e∃e′ eat(x)(e′) ^ FIN(e′)(e))]
v. [λxλs∃e∃e′ RESULT(s)(e) ^ eat(x)(e′) ^ FIN(e′)(e))]

Is the above correctly reduced or am I missing something? Thanks so much! (This is not homework btw, just trying to refresh my knowledge)",1625660859,natthrafninn,0

I don't know if this is relevant, mods please delete, but a while ago, someone mentioned George Bernard Shaw's desire to fix English spelling by inventing a new alphabet and seemed to think nothing came of it.

I have a book which was given to my father in 1962 which I think is the only example of a book published in that new alphabet. It wasn't invented by Shaw himself, it was invented in a competition funded by his will. There's lots of detail in the book but as you can see it's a very old book and scanning it isn't easy.

The Shavian Alphabet is a phonetic alphabet, intended to be:

&gt; a more efficient alphabet of at least forty letters than the existing one of twenty-six letters to enable 'the said language to be written without indicating single sounds by groups of letters or by diacritical marks'.",1625642534,Negative12DollarBill,1

linguistics,"""Mary Ann"" Vowels in North American English","I'm venturing a theory that the vowels in ""Mary"" and ""Ann"" are created by same phonological process, namely [/æ/ tensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//%C3%A6/_raising). The latter is commonly referred as such, but I've never seen any sources propose it for the former.

There are three pieces of evidence that I would like to put forward in support of this theory:

* The first is of course the plain phonetic similarity of their typical realizations, which seems too obvious a match to ignore: \[ɛɚ\] and \[ɛ̃ə̃\].
* The second is that the regions that don't merge ""marry"" and ""Mary"" seem to be roughly those that similarly don't tense /æ/ when the following nasal is intervocalic, so the distinction between ""marry"" and ""Mary"" could be taken as akin to that between ""planet"" and ""plan it."" 
* Lastly, it seems that no accent whatsoever with generalized /æ/ raising distinguishes ""marry"" and ""Mary,"" even though some of them are geographically pretty close to some others in which that distinction is very robust. In fact, I've never met a *single* native speaker with generalized /æ/ raising who nonetheless distinguishes ""marry"" and ""Mary.""

Additionally, the spurious g’s are pronounced in Bokmål-like spoken Norwegian only, but not in any other variant.

I can’t think of any set of regular changes that could have given this exact outcome. Any ideas?

| g in:   | Spoken |      | Spelling |      |

| Nynorsk | Yes    | No   | Yes      | No   |

2. if lj merged into lgj first then regained g through hypercorrection, why is it pronounced in Bokmål, when neither the Danish (where the spelling got its influence) nor the Nynorsk-like spoken norwegian variants do?

1. Kinship names and titles (mom, dad, teacher, etc)
2. Basic daily expressions and common set phrases (hi, thank you, etc)
3. Random isolated words and sentences made up of a few words (really?, I see, etc)
4. Distinction between formal and informal language (specific to Korean) in verb endings (먹어/먹어요/먹습니다 for eating, etc)
5. Other frequent names, titles, words and expressions but which are more complex 
6. Distinction between formal and informal language in nouns (집/댁 for a house, etc)
7. Adverbs, linking words and word endings related to grammar points (지만, 는데, etc)
8. Making links between similar words and 'basic etymology' (학 is in common between 학교, 하색, 학원, 수학, etc)
9. Basic idioms (키가 막히다, etc)
10. Abbreviations and slang (초딩, etc)
11. More complex titles and words to describe human relationships (talking about the in-laws for example) and vocabulary and verbs related to more complex situations (names of diseases, nuances between verbs translated the same but used in different contexts etc)

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1625482813,AutoModerator,279

linguistics,How to transcribe non-phonemic diphthongs,"Hi, I'm a new user here. I've always been puzzled abut the complexity of transcibing diphthongs, and the various systems that can be found.

Probably the first ones should be transcribed with two vowel symbols, while the second ones with a vowel and a semiconsonant (/j, w/), just like the so-called ""risng diphthongs"" that are always transcribed /jV, wV/, where /V/ indicates a generic vowel.

For example, suppose the first humans spread to Australia with a single language, covering the continent. After 15,000 years, there will be lots of different language families that can no longer be linked to each other. But give it another 15,000 years, and there's no reason to expect *more* language families necessarily, is there?

* Not a lot of colleges offer linguistics majors.

My list already includes MIT, Stanford, and other schools with a prominent impact on the world of linguistics research, and as much as I would love to bank on getting into one of them, it would be nice to have a fallback option and know that I can still study my passion.
* It's hard to tell linguistics programs apart. Which colleges are investing in their linguistics departments and funding research? Are certain programs more heavily focused on the computational aspect of linguistics, others more so on language preservation, historical linguistics, or things like speech and hearing sciences? What's the difference between as BS and a BA?

linguistics,"We figured out how Shakespeare sounded, but it's not as clear how Cervantes did. In this essay I will...","Hi all, last year I studied in Seville and took some linguistics classes as well as some literature classes. I thought it was really interesting how Spanish has evolved and I wanted to take a diachronic and diatopic approach to hypothesize what kind of phonemes Cervantes most likely used when speaking. I was really inspired to find this out after learning that Cervantes and Shakespeare lived in the same time period, but the way Cervantes spoke doesn't seem to be as well known as the way Shakespeare spoke.

The question is actually a lot more interesting than it sounds since linguistic changes were occuring on massive scales during Cervantes's lifetime. Around this time was when the dialect that we now associate with Latin America (and Southern Spain, the OG) became very distinct from the dialect we now associate with Central and Northern Spain. On top of this, further complicating matters is that Cervantes moved all over the place, had parents from different parts of Spain, and had exposure to many different social class environments.

The logic of the paper is that I tried to identify all the possible dialects Cervantes would have had significant exposure to, and then analyze his personal philosophies and linguistic background to hypothesize what dialect he most likely spoke. I was fortunate enough to find one article written by a scholar named Daniel Eisenberg who analyzed Cervantes's writing to find phonetic markers. At the end of my paper, I compare my theory to Eisenberg's analysis and see what similarities and differences we had in our conclusions. 

Just as a disclaimer, I did no ""original"" research and I did not go through all the original texts. All of my analysis was based on what more established scholars have written, and I just consolidated and analyzed them for my own project. I don't claim any expertise. I'm not entering academia least of all for Hispanic studies, but I am completing a Spanish BA degree. You can expect I don't have the depth of knowledge to be very sure that I haven't missed something, especially since my native language is not Spanish. I just did this because it was fun and very interesting. I think it was worth the months of research though!

Here's the powerpoint I made, accompanied by the essay I wrote. I think I took any identifying info out, but please let me know if I left anything in there. Oh, also the sources can all be found online, as I had to do this during Covid.

linguistics,Why does it seem like languages with historical spelling sound more like the modern form than the ancient form at the halfway point between the stage the spelling is based on and the present day?,"Intuitively it seems like there should be no good reason for this to be the case, but in all three languages with historical orthography I have some familiarity with the history of:

* English spelling is based more or less on early-to-mid 1400s pronunciation. But when I listen to reconstructions of early-to-mid 1700s speech (halfway between now and the present day) it sounds much more like Modern English than early-to-mid 1400s English- Great Vowel Shift mostly or entirely complete, postvocalic /x/ dropped, consonant clusters like /kn/ reduced, etc.

* Greek spelling as it comes down to us today is based essentially on the Attic Greek of around 400 or 500 BCE. Halfway between then and the present day, so around 800 CE or so, length and pitch distinctions had collapsed, diphthongs had become monophthongs, voiced and aspirated stops had long since turned into fricatives, and in general it sounded much more like Modern Greek than the Attic that the spelling was initially based on.

* For Japanese, I can't find exactly when historical kana spelling is based on beyond ""some time in the Heian"" period, but assuming the earliest possible date within that time frame, around 800 or so, then the halfway point would be in the early 1400s. By then /wi/ and /we/ had already disappeared, intervocalic /w/ and /p/ had already merged, many diphthongs had already turned into monophthongs, and in general it sounded much more like Modern Japanese than the Late Old or Early Middle Japanese the kana spelling was based on.

Is this just a random effect of the three heavily historically spelled languages I happen to be somewhat familiar with the phonological history of, or is there some deeper reason, like the spelling tending for some reason to have been based on a conservative variety when it was first codified or semi-codified?",1625234074,Terpomo11,12

linguistics,Can someone explain these examples of laboured enunciation of T sounds in American English? (links to videos in comments),"I've seen a few examples of speakers with otherwise normal American (or Canadian) accents, who for some reason really enunciate certain T sounds with the front of their tongue in a very unnatural-sounding way. 

An example is pronouncing both Ts in ""important"" as one would pronounce the T in ""tile"". It completely contradicts the usual more silent pronunciation and sounds really laboured and strange to me. It also results in surrounding vowel sounds changing in a strange way. 

For reference, the below speakers seem to make a marked effort to enunciate their T sounds (though they apply this effort quite inconsistently). 

* [Here](https://youtu.be/gA6L7pgcUbM?t=246), the speaker enunciates the double T in ""flattened"", yet pronounces other words like ""personality"" in a more typical way. 

* [Here](https://youtu.be/gA6L7pgcUbM?t=436) is the example I described above, of the same speaker enunciating the T in ""important"".

* [Here](https://youtu.be/aPkQ57cXrPA?t=518), the (Canadian?) speaker enunciates the T in ""heightened"" really strongly, yet later says ""hypnotic"" and ""repeated"" normally.

I was hoping someone here could tell me what this type of pronunciation is called, and offer any insight as to whether this is an accent or something they're doing intentionally, e.g. to sound more educated or authoritative? I'm from the UK so might be lacking context.",1625222714,patternboy,8
linguistics,Does my office have a pigeon language?,"I’m no linguist and I hope this doesn’t sound like a bad linguistics post! 

I’m an English speaker who moved to a German speaking city in Central Europe and have a lot of interaction with speakers of German socially and through work. 

I’ve become really interested in the way that communication works between myself and others when we don’t really share a large amount of overlap. This post is specifically about how I speak with my team who all speak intermediate English.

I’ve noticed a few things in myself when I need to speak. Unsurprisingly, genders fall away when I speak (aside for describing people), as does the importance of word order. The other thing is that I use a lot of English words for more modern words sort of germanified, as I assume they’ve carried over, and French derived English words for older things. It doesn’t always work but it functions quite well. 

I’ve also noticed that German speakers will plug german nouns into English grammar. Not just the occasional word either but essentially most nouns. 

I’ve noticed they also favour French derived words from German or clear cognates to the extent that you wouldn’t really see these word choices being used in proper German. Outside of my office I do think “okay, now you have to speak by the book.”

I realised during a meeting that the language bring spoken wasn’t really German and it wasn’t really English, it wasn’t really the Denglish that people in this part of the word would be familiar with either. 

It’s been a year and a half and it’s slowly become like this, it wasn’t the slow painful German we used to speak. It’s only slightly less fast than speaking in English and only slightly less nuanced in what we can express.

Another thing I’ve noticed is we all use the same little words or phrases peppered about the place.

Of course, the grammar would move between German and English as we felt more confident or careful or as someone gets passionate but it would come back to this sort of hybrid.

I’ve seen some argue that it was SVO. The biggest issue here in my mind is the frequency of VSO in Polynesian languages (a subfamily of Oceanic).  The SVO proponents that I’ve read argue that the Polynesian VSO originated from a POc locative marker being reanalyzed as an object marker, but then this would require that POc intransitives were commonly VS. I have not actually seen any supporters of this argument discuss the intransitive word order, so I can’t be sure that this was actually the case. Also, languages with VS intransitives with SVO transitives, while certainly not impossible, are relatively rare. So I’m not completely sold on this argument.

On the other hand, I’ve seen NO arguments for VSO in POc, only that such an argument has indeed been made. So I don’t know what to make of this theory either.

Hungarian is difficult because it isn't anywhere related at all to Indo-European 

Xhosa is difficult because it has ""clicks"" to represent different consonants

Greenlandic is difficult because it has strange and wacky grammar

Navajo is difficult because it uses something called ""aspect"" which stresses the way that something is done.

But I'm kind of confused about a lot of these things I see in codenames. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, the game allows compound words right? But there are different types of compound words. Hyphenated, Closed, and Open. Closed is like overboard, open is like Ice Cream, and hyphenated is like Father-in-law. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most people in codenames of course allow closed compound words, never allow open, and usually allow hyphenated. This is fine and its a flexible rule that's up to the server and codemasters. (House Rules)

&amp;#x200B;

But then I'm seeing people hyphenating phrasal verbs and saying its a hyphenated compound word when it isn't to me. 

For example Back up becomes Back-up or Wake up becomes Wake-up. But when I google Wake-up Call, it is spelled like this with the hypen.   


Do phrasal verbs have to be two separate words? Can **Back**\-**up** be Backup or Back up and are these all valid spellings? I was reading the verb ""Back up"" has to be two separate words and never hyphenated.",1625010624,HaeL756,2

They go on to say this:

\&gt; The above evidence is not partial or ambiguous. It is clear and sweeping: the elements of the culture common to the Rigveda and the Mitanni are not pre-Rigvedic (formed during some hypothetical period in Central Asia before the ""arrival"" of the Indo-Aryans ""into"" India). They are Late Rigvedic, i.e. they belong to the period of composition of the New Books.

linguistics,"Usage of ""Sunday"" versus ""the Lord's day"" by Christians in different languages","Something I've realized is that in Korea when Christians talk to each other the word 주일 (the Lord's day) is used in place of 일요일 (Sunday).

What I don't understand is why this same logic is not used by Christians, followers of the same set of theology, in other cultures and societies.

I have many English-speaking Christian brothers and sisters that casually use ""Sunday"" instead of ""the Lord's day"" unless if reading actual Bible verses (ex. Revelation 1:10).

Furthermore, the terminology by which he calls things ""retracted alveolar"" is something I don't understand. Namely, his (as seen in the appendix of attested inventories) use of the retracted alveolar terminology to describe every kind of lateral fricative implies he may have a non-standard definition of ""retracted alveolar"" that he uses to consider many sibilants retracted alveolar (making no destinction between contrastive retr.alveolar sibilants as in basque and old romance languages) and single-sibilant-PoA ""retracted alveolar.""

the basic principles are clear to me: constructions are pairs of form and meaning and can happen on various levels: morphemes (e.g. ""-less"", as in ""priceless""), words (""sky""), multi-word expressions (""kick the bucket""). 

however, i struggle to understand how construction grammar(s) would deal with sequences like ""colourless green ideas"" (GG says it's meaningless) or ""married bachelor"". we have basic constructions at a word level [married, bachelor] and they form a ADJ-N construction. 

but the contradictory meaning seems to stem from the meanings of its elements (married vs bachelor; colourless vs green), and not just the contradictory meaning of the higher level construction. 

would CG say ""colourless green ideas"" is meaningless? how about ""married bachelor""? how does CG get to contradictory meanings, if at all? any input is appreciated - thank you!",1624886339,radicalwash,4

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1624878015,AutoModerator,345

linguistics,a brief overview of Samoyedic words of Turkic origin,"so far some 30 samoyedic words are detected to be Turkic in origin . for this reading you can check out [here](https://www.academia.edu/36564880/Turkic_lexical_borrowings_in_Samoyed) and [here](https://kpfu.ru/portal/docs/F230999094/01.pdf).

anyway , a direct borrowing from Proto Turkic to Proto Samoyedic is doubtful , as Peter Sauli Piispanen correctly utters : 

&gt;to my understanding, all suggested borrowings between Proto-Turkic and Proto Samoyed represent several different chronological layers over many centuries of time.

for a better understanding , we need to go deeper in Turkic words of Samoyedic languages . Anna Vladimirovna Dybo has compiled 21 possible Turkic borrowing into Proto Samoyedic and 6 possible words as vice versa direction. Dybo categorized Turkic loans into two packs  , common turkic and proto turkic , this , however , must not make us think that these words entered samoyedic via some common turkic languages , because poor attestation of Oghuric branch cognates makes us point out to only common turkic attested words. 

from 21 Proto Samoyedic  words of Turkic origin listed by Dybo , we are not linguistically able to determine which post-Proto Turkic branch was the source of borrowing in many cases , anyway , such linguistic methods help us determine the exact Turkic branch in some cases as follows (underlined with Red) :

given these arguments and the fact that some of these Turkic words are Oghuric ,  many other unclear loans must be interpreted as Oghuric as well , this endorses the fact that proto Samoyedic or perhaps different branches of samoyedic had contact with Oghuric branch of Turkic languages , neither Proto turkic nor common turkic branches",1624870096,jaqdpanther,0

I did some reading and it looks like that the language of Old Prussians was actually a form of Baltic language rather than Slavic.

If anyone made a more thorough research on that subject and would like to say a few words about it?

linguistics,Do you think English is fundamentally changing all other languages on the planet?,"I'm not just referring to loanwords, but changing the structure of the language as well. As well as sound of the languages. I've spoken to several people from several different countries all over the world, and many of them say that youngsters are more and more phrasing their sentences in 'direct translation' from an English way of saying it, even if it doesn't really make sense in the native language. They also often know/use an English word more than native, and forget the native word. It may sound weird today, but it will probably be the default in a generation or two.

We've never had an age of information before.  English dominates as a lingua franca and dominates in business, science, technology, internet, tourism, media, music etc, and practically every other other thing, and no other language comes close. It's also spoken on every continent. Practically every country teaches it at school.

And because of all that, it's now in a 'self-sustaining snowball' effect and getting even bigger, as more and more people speak it.

linguistics,Suddenly understanding a language you couldn't understand 2 minutes ago.,"I'd like to share this story here because it seems to be the most fitting place to put it. Some background information about me, I am a Norwegian lad from rural western Norway, and I have had quite a lot of experience with Swedish. My family used to go to Sweden every summer so I can almost understand everything in a swedish conversation. 

So for the story: I was in my WW2 phase when I started to be very interested in the winter war, and especially Mannerheim (a prominent person in the war)
Thus I stumbled upon this video: https://youtu.be/RL852iEZ2zM
It is baisically just a copy of the famous hitler bunker scene.
Since Mannerheim was Finnish, I assumed the video was Finnish, and I could for the life of me figureout a single word. However, after the breakdown began I heard ""Vad i helvete är dette her?"" and was stunned. That was swedish. Then I remember a little fact about Mannerheim; he could not speak Finnish, only swedish. Thus, I rewatched the first minute of the video and I could understand everything perfectly. I cannot state this enough, I may have some trouble with swedish sometimes but I could understand all of it. I went from understanding nothing to everything. 

One thing to add though, they spoke with what I percieved to be a heavy Finnish accent. I know they were just speaking a Swedish dialect from Finland (with how they pronounced ""kärlejk""

linguistics,Ubykh orthography (just for fun),"Behold, the consonant inventory of Ubykh! This now-extinct Caucasian language is famous for having the largest number of consonant phonemes ever recorded in a non-click language (and, at the other extreme, having only two phonemic vowels.) Though it was well-document by linguists prior to its extinction, Ubykh was never a written a language and has never had any kind of official orthography. Various parties have proposed orthographies over the years, and just for fun I thought I'd try my hand at making my own. This is very much a work in progress that I just whipped together in a couple hours for shits and giggles, but I figured I'd post it and see what people thought. This will be an orthography using the Latin alphabet, designed for use by English speakers.  Representing the vast number of phonemes in the Latin alphabet will not be a simple matter, requiring many digraphs, trigraphs, and even quadrigraphs (tetragraphs?). While using four letters to represent a single sound is admittedly unwieldy, Ubykh thankfully almost never features clusters of more than two consonants in a row, which will prevent writing from getting \*too\* cluttered.

Many of these phonemes are also found (more or less) in English, so I'll start by simply assigning them the English letter which share their values (which are also often, but not always, their IPA symbols.) So the plain voiceless labial stop \[p\] will be represented by the letter /p/ and its voiced counterpart \[b\] by /b/, the plain voiceless alveolar stop \[t\] by the letter /t/ and its voiced counterpart \[d\] by the letter /d/, and the plain voicless velar stop \[k\] by the letter /k/ and its voiced counterpart \[g\] by the letter /g/; the voiceless labial fricative \[f\] by the letter /f/ and its voiced counterpart \[v\] by the letter /v/, the voiceless alveolar fricative \[s\] by the letter /s/ and its voiced counterpart \[z\] by the letter /z/, and the plain voiceless alveolar affricate  \[t͡s\] by the digraph /ts/ and its voiced counterpart  \[d͡z\] by the digraph /dz/; the labial nasal \[m\] by the letter /m/ and the alveolar nasal \[n\] by the letter /n/; the trill \[r\] by the letter /r/ and the lateral approximant \[l\] by the letter /l/; the palatal apprixmant \[j\] by the letter /y/ and the velar approximant \[w\] by the letter /w/; and the glottal fricative \[h\] by the letter /h/.

It also seemed logical to follow the IPA in using the letter /q/ for the plain voicless uvular stop \[q\], and in using apostrophes to mark ejectives, giving us /p' t' k' q' ts'/ representing  \[pʼ tʼ kʼ qʼ t͡sʼ\] . In terms of secondary articulations, labialization and palatalization can be marked by making di- and trigraphs with /w/ and /y/ respectively, giving us /tw dw tw' kw gw kw' qw qw'/ representing  \[tʷ dʷ tʷʼ kʷ gʷ kʷʼ qʷ qʷʼ\]  and /ky gy ky' qy qy'/ representing \[kʲ gʲ kʲʼ qʲ qʲʼ\].

Pharyngealization is the first place I ran into real trouble, as there is no standalone pharyngeal sound that I could use for digraphs. My first thought was to use /h/, so for example  \[pˤ\] would be represented as /ph/. I actually kind of like the look of this (though admittedly the particular digraph might be confusing to English speakers used to reading it as \[f\]). However, later in on the process I decided to use \[h\] digraphs for something else (we'll get to that.) The next thing I considered was using a dot beneath the letter, which often represents phryngealization in the romanization of Arabic. However, I could of disliked that for petty aesthetic reasons, and also decided they could be better elsewhere. I'm currently kind of between two options: using the letter /c/, which isn't used elsewhere, so  \[pˤ\] would be written as /pc/; or, because geminate consonants don't appear to be present in Ubykh, simply doubling the letter, so that  \[pˤ\] would be written as /pp/.  I'm eager to hear any suggestions on this front.

Now, on to the post-alveolars. There are three series here: standard post-alveolar, alveolo-palatal, and retroflex. I think the simplest way to do this would be to simply use a different diacritic to distingish the three. I think I'm leaning towards using a hacek for the postalveolars, so /š ž šw žw tš dž tš'/ representing \[ʃ ʒ  ʃʷ ʒʷ  t̠͡ʃ d̠͡ʒ t̠͡ʃʼ\] (and yes I'm aware that  \[t̠͡ʃ\] and  \[d̠͡ʒ\] are similar to the sounds represented by /ch/ and /j/ in English but for consitency's sake I'd rather use /tš/ and /dž/). The acute accent would be for alveolo-palatals, with  /ś ź św źw tś dź tś' tśw dźw tśw'/ representing  \[ɕ ʑ  ɕʷ  ʑʷ   t͡ɕ d͡ʑ t͡ɕʼ   t͡ɕʷ d͡ʑʷ t͡ɕʷʼ\], and a dot over top would represent the retroflexes, with /ṡ  ż t ṡ dż tṡ'/ representing  \[ʂ ʐ ʈ͡ʂ ɖ͡ʐ ʈ͡ʂʼ\]. I like the symmetry of it all.

For the lateral fricative  \[ɬ\] I considered /hl/, which seems like a good approximation of its pronunciation, and /ll/, which represents it in Welsh, but I think ultimately I'm going with /ł/, which represents the sound in the orthology of some Indigenous North American languages, such as Gwich'in.

And finally, the part that gave me the most trouble: the velar and uvular fricatives. I puzzled a bit over what to do with these. I briefly considered trying to somehow use /x/ and /j/, the only Latin consonant letters I hadn't used yet, but that seemed to be stretching things. Ultimately the reason I decided not to use /h/ to represent pharyngealizayion is because I thought it could be put to better use here. It's somewhat common to use the digraphs /kh gh/ to represent the velar fricatives  \[x ɣ\], and from that I extrapolated /qh/ for the voiceless uvular stop  \[χ\], and /qhy qhw qhc qhcw/ for its variations  \[χʲ χʷ χˤ χˤʷ\]. That last tetragraph (quadragraph?) is definitrly starting to get a little ridiculous, but I was running low on brain power by this time, and that what all of my previous established patterns gave me.This left another puzzle for what to do with the voiced uvular fricative  \[ʁ\], as there was no voiced uvular stop for me to add an /h/ to. Ultimately, I went with /rh rhy rhw rhc rhcw/. The uvular fricative is represent by an /r/ in languages like French and German, and its IPA symbol is derived from /r/. It's not a great solution, but it's the best I could come up with. 

And that's what I've got! A full orthography representing all 84 Ubykh consonant phonemes. What do you guys think? What might you have done differently? Please, let me know!

linguistics,Is there any general explanation or theory as to why interjections tend to have larger phoneme inventories and less phonotactic restrictions than the lexical level does?,"In English, for example, \[u\] and \[ɪu\] don't contrast at the lexical level in English, but they contrast the interjections /u/ (""ooo, that's a nice car!"") and /ɪu/ (ie: ""eeww, that's disgusting"")

Another example is that at the lexical level, /ɛ/ and /æ/ cannot be word final, but there are interjections like ""meh"" (/mɛ/), ""eh"" (/ɛ/), ""bleh"" (/blɛ/),  ""ahh"" (/æ/) and ""nah"" (/næ/)

There are a bunch more examples in English but this isn't an English only phenomenon.

In Dakota, vowel stress can only be on the first or second syllable, and this is rigid because the stress shifts when prefixes are added, yet **stress appears on later syllables in interjections**.

In Luiseño, from what I've read *(admittedly a small amount)*, there are claimed to be three phonemic vowel lengths, but **""double long"" vowels seem to only appear in interjections**.

Also keep in mind that the examples I gave, the way I see it, cannot be interpreted as paralinguistic gestures like ""shhh"", ""psst"", ""hmmm"", ""bzzzz"", ""brrr"", etc.. I was very careful with the examples I chose to give, because although onamonapia can explain things like ""bzzz"", ""brr"", ""pssst"", and so on, it doesn't explain Dakota stress irregularities in interjections, nor /u/ vs. /ɪu/ in English interjection, etc.

When it comes to the average number of vowels I could not find much reliable information on either the English or the Greek statistic.

There is also suffixes and prefixes to add to the equation as well. This is harder in Greek as most word endings change when you make them plural.

linguistics,Why do linguists often feel the need to fight prescriptivism? Isn't prescriptivism itself a naturally occurring part of language?,"First, to clarify: I know that linguistics is descriptive. I have read several posts on this subreddit and others stating that there is no dichotomy between descriptivism and prescriptivism in linguistics, and that all linguists are descriptivists (although I hear different things about how linguistics is practised in Eastern Europe). I am aware of this.

That said, I'm not sure why linguists (or people with linguistics qualifications) on the internet seem bent on insulting anyone with prescriptive beliefs. Most of the time, the gist of the message seems to be: 'Descriptivism is science; prescriptivists are no better than flat-Earthers.' There is a marked tendency to treat the prescriptivist as stupid or dangerous, when most of the time they are just repeating a bit of traditional grammar they learned in school. Why demonise them? Prescriptivism makes normative judgements in language. This seems, well, normal to me, because human beings in general tend to make normative judgements on a lot of things. Such judgements are a naturally occurring feature of human behaviour. Prescriptivism has occurred naturally in many languages since antiquity, and influences the way languages have developed. 

For example, the modern Turkish language is a product of language planning in the 1930s, replacing Persian and Arabic loanwords with newly-coined words from native Turkic roots. An essentially prescriptive policy intended to ""purify"" the language (whatever you might make of that) and moreover one that *worked*. Ottoman Turkish is said to have been 88% Arabic and Persian in its vocabulary; Modern Turkish is 89% Turkish and only about 7% Arabic and Persian. Clearly, the prescription was successful and had a real effect on Turkish usage. I don't know, maybe if a modern-day linguist had been around to criticise them, the Turkish language planners would have decided prescription was useless and given up.

Rather than acknowledging prescription as a substantial influence on language and giving prescriptivist thinkers their say, linguists tend to treat prescriptivism as a social evil, something to be resisted and fought. Why?",1624531113,r_Hodgeheg,4

linguistics,"How are Arabic Numerals, and symbols like &lt;&amp; % = +&gt;, morphemic?","

&gt;### 2.2 Relationship to Language

&gt;A primary consideration for us is to determine what linguistic level graphemes
represent. In the Roman alphabet, the letters are related to some level of the phonology;
however, **the numerals &lt;1, 2, 3&gt; etc. are all related to morphemes [emphasis mine]**. All writing
systems seem to have some variation as to the linguistic level involved, but we
can often usefully speak of the level of language which is primarily related to the
graphemes of a writing system.

Henry Rogers, *Writing Systems* (2004), p 13.

&gt;This taxonomic scheme has a certain amount of validity to it, but on closer
examination, it is problematic. First, writing systems are taxonomically 'messy'.
Writing systems are mixtures of some sort or other. Sometimes, the mixture is
relatively small and can be set aside. Finnish is often cited for its simple one-to-one
relationship between grapheme and segment. We saw in chapter 9 that there are
three minor exceptions to this relationship, and also, like most modern writing
systems, Finnish uses **Arabic numerals, as well as symbols such as &lt;&amp; % = +&gt;,
which are clearly morphemically based [emphasis mine]**. If Finnish were our worst case of typological
mixture, we probably would not worry a great deal.

One could refer to thighs in English as, well, thighs of course, and “hams” rarely. But it is still valid. 

In Chinese (Mandarin), 腿 means both leg and ham, while 大腿 means thighs.

linguistics,would it be wrong of me to completely avoid teaching my future child my native language?,"I (F22) am originally from Russia but my parents and I moved to America when I was 3 years old.

linguistics,"Inter-word phonemes; phrasal phonemes… just basic allophones, or something more?","Usually pairs of sounds are said to be in contrastive distribution when swapping them can (or does) create a new word. 

But what I want to talk about is something I've never read about, only noticed for myself, but I'm sure the phenomena has a formal name, so **if anyone knows that name, please inform!** For now, I'm calling them phrasal phonemes.

The aspirated and tenuis plosives are said to be in complimentary distribution in English. I'll use /k/ to briefly summarize the distribution.

**/k/ is aspirated \[kʰ\] when:**

*1. It's the onset of a stressed syllable, whether that's before a vowel (ie: ""kick""; \[kʰɪk\]) or a liquid (ie: ""clan""; \[kʰlæn\]) \[exception: rule #3).*

*2. It's the first sound of a word before an unstressed vowel (ie: ""constrain""; \[kʰən 'streɪn\])*

**/k/ is tenuis \[k\] when:**

*3. It's in an /sk/ onset cluster (ie: ""skill""; \[skɪl\])*

*4. It's the onset in an unstressed syllable (ie: ""token""; \['tʰoʊ.kən\]) \[exception: rule #2\]*

*5. It is the final sound of a word and the next word starts with a vowel (ie: ""pick any""; \['pɪk '*[*ɛ.ni*](https://ɛ.ni)*\])*

*As a side note, this is at least the distribution for my speech. Perhaps the distribution isn't the same for you.*

&amp;#x200B;

Why do allophones exist? It seems like some allophones just exist for **articulatory convenience**. Palatalization happens because it's more convenient to use a palatal or post-alveolar consonant before a front vowel because the tongue is in the same area.

Some allophones seem to exist to **expand the articulatory cues between similar sounds**, such as vowel lengthening in English when there is a voiced coda. This can help distinguish ""wheat"" and ""weed"", especially when the final plosives are unreleased, and ""bus"" and ""buzz"", especially when the final /z/ is partially or fully devoiced in pausa.

But what I'm here to inquire, discuss about is that some seeming allophones seem to have the function of **distinguishing minimal pairs on the phrasal level** (hence ""phrasal phonemes""). Here are some examples that distinguish between three levels of voice onset time in English if our analysis takes pace on the phrasal level instead of the word level.

&amp;#x200B;

**Example #1:** ""pecan"" \[ˈpʰiˌkʰɑn\], ""peak on"" \[ˈpʰiˌkɑn\], ""pee gone"" \[ˈpʰiˌgɑn\]

*""Don't peak on the man making his pee gone as he eats a pecan""*... a pretty silly sentence, but hey it works!

This isn't not a suitable example for many speakers, such as those that cannot copula drop (""pee gone"") and in general the pronunciation of ""pecan"" varies a lot depending on the dialect, but the cot-caught merger shouldn't effect the harmony between the /ɑ/ or /ɔ/vowels.

&amp;#x200B;

**Example #2:** ""key pit"" \[kipʰɪt\], ""keep it"" \[kipɪt\], ""key bit"" \[kibɪt\]

Maybe not the best example as the stress on ""it"" might be reduced, but if it's in pausa it will have some stress.

&amp;#x200B;

**Example #3:** ""we came"" \[wiˈkʰeɪm\], ""weak aim"" \[wiˈkeɪm\], ""we game"" \[wiˈgeɪm\]

""Weak aim"" might not sound idiomatic to some people, but for me ""weak"" can be used to describe any lacking ability or skill, ie: ""your dribbling is weak"", ""your presentation abilities are weak"" or ""their point guard has a weak passing game""

&amp;#x200B;

And the following two examples have \[ɾ\] distinguishing a phrase from \[tʰ\] and \[d\]

**Example #4:** ""a tall"" \[ə'tʰɑl\], ""at all"" \[ə'ɾɑl\], ""a doll"" \[ə'dɑl\]

* *""I don't know a tall man!""*
* *""I don't know at all man!""* (formally written like ""at all, man""… but at least for me, that comma doesn't indicate any prosodic pause)
* *""I don't know a doll man!""* (somewhat nonsensical, but let's say a ""doll man"" is a man who collects dolls)

&amp;#x200B;

**Example #5:** ""may taze"" \[meɪtʰɪez\], ""made As"" \[meɪɾeɪz\], ""may daze"" \[meɪdeɪz\]

* *""you may daze off after the introduction""*
* *""you made As last semester""*
* *""you may taze me after I urinate""*

There are a lot more which just contrast an aspirated plosive and a tenuis plosive, such as ""sea kit"" and ""seek it"", but I thought it was only salient to document phrases that contrasted all three.

&amp;#x200B;

**Discussion**

Anyway, these feel more important or essential than other allophones. Like if I look at this from a language teaching perspective, it seems like it's more important to teach these ""phrasal phonemes"" than other allophones. Typically, if allophones aren't used, the pronunciation might sound ""off"" or sound less natural, but it never changes the meaning. But the examples I provided, meaning is changed depending on the ""allophone"" used. Of course, which allophone is used is completely predictable. So paradoxically, it is simultaneously contrastive and predictable.

**Do you think these should be considered different phonemes or not?** I see arguments for both sides. Like, allophones don't contrast meaning with each other; you can't find minimal pairs or minimal triplets by switching allophones. But on the other hand, phonemes aren't predictable via phonological processes, and individual words cannot contrast with these pairs / triplets.

**How important should the phrase level be when deciding if certain sound pairs are in contrastive distribution? Should this decision be exclusive to word level analysis?** I don't know, which is why I called them phrasal phonemes. My current stance is that they aren't ""phonemes"" but they also cannot be analyzed as being in ""complimentary distribution"", so they're something different.

My last question is: **Do any of you know any other examples of this ""phrasal phoneme""**, whether that's in English or another language?

Also, would someone still be able to say damn if they were referring to a hydroelectric dam? Or would they curse 1 second, then draw a blank when referring to the nonvulger noun? Can someone in this situation still use curse words for their meaning (like f@$% to refer to intercourse) or only shout them out when angry or in pain?

The word my peers say is of a river, which makes sense but I cannot see any other state saying such as, well. They don't have the river. It simply wouldn't make sense.  
Another example I can think of is I used to hear little kids counting with 'Alligator' so, they'd say 1alligator2alligator3alligator to space the words and keep to seconds. Most people want to count faster than seconds and that's why I think these words are put there the way they are.

linguistics,Vowel length notation - any way to represent an extra long vowel?,"hey, I was wondering if there's any way to mark vowels that are very long.

here's an example; I recently encountered the Hebrew word ההעתקה - 'the copying' (which would probably be transcribed as something like haha'ataka) for most young modern Hebrew speakers it seems to be realized as an extra long vowel, 3 times the length of a regular a.

basically, adjacent syllables that have the same vowel tend to merge if they have the letters א/ע/ה (h/') separating them. 

so I know sometimes long vowels are represented like this  ā   
but I don't feel like it really gives the reader a good idea of how long the vowel actually is. it would seem accurate for a word like אהבה - love (ahava) where only 2 vowels merge, which sounds much more like a typical long vowel by what I've heard so far from various languages. writing āva is pretty much a perfect phonetic writing of the word. 

so id love to know if there's any easy way of representing such thing, that would be really great :D",1624328647,shirkshark,8

linguistics,I'm trying to debunk the myth that the Tsez language of Dagestan has 64 seperate noun cases.,"I made a video about it if anyone's interested. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHI4gMLNl0c&amp;t=17s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHI4gMLNl0c&amp;t=17s)

I see this mentioned a lot in linguistic circles, but I managed to trace it back to a grammatical sketch that... isn't very good.

[http://www.mariapolinsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Tsez\_Final.pdf](http://www.mariapolinsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Tsez_Final.pdf)

According to this, Tsez apparently has 8 syntactic cases and 56 locative cases, except that it counts 2 different forms of the genitive as two seperate cases, it counts 2 different forms of the equative (which i wouldn't even call a case seing as it can be added to numerals and adverbs), and the 56 locative cases are actually just all the different realisations of a single locative suffix that combines morphemes into 3 different slots.

linguistics,"What really is the definition of ""sexual act""?","I'm not sure where this question is appropriate. I'm posting here because it has to do with definitions, but please let me know if there are more appropriate subreddits (I'm also not here to see what someone subjectively finds ""gross"", this is supposed to be an educational post, so if there is something in this post you find ""gross"", please do not read any further). 

I want to know what it means when someone says they just had ""sex"". 

""Sex"" is not just ""an activity in which one's genitalia is stimulated by the genitalia of another"", no. There are different types of ""sex"", such as oral sex in which one's genitalia is stimulated by the mouth of another, and anal sex in which one's genitalia is stimulated by the anus of another. 

There's cunnilingus and analingus. Cunnilingus is an activity in which a woman's genitalia is stimulated by someone else's mouth or tongue. It's a type of oral sex. Analingus is an activity in which someone's anus is stimulated by someone else's mouth or tongue. 

But that's where I'm confused. So far, everywhere I've looked oral sex has been defined as ""when someone uses their mouth to sexually stimulate the genitals of someone else"". Anus is not a genital, so how can analingus be considered oral sex? 

Either the definition of oral sex should change to include analingus, or we should consider analingus another form of sex, different from oral sex. 

But then there are many other questions. If analingus is a form of sex, or sexual activity, eventhough there are no genitals involved (it's just mouth and anus), why wouldn't other forms of activity that do not involve a genitalia be considered sex? For example, kissing, which is when someone's mouth stimulates someone else's body parts, such as mouth, hand, etc, etc.

Why wouldn't kissing be considered a sexual act or sex, just as analingus is? 

And if oral sex is a form of sex eventhough only one genital is present, why wouldn't masturbation be considered a form of sex? There is a genitalia involved in masturbation, which is stimulated by the hands, or other objects such as toys. This is exactly similar to oral sex in which only one genital is present, so why wouldn't masturbation be considered sex, or a sexual activity? 

And if masturbation can be considered a sexual activity, why wouldn't that mean anyone who has ever masturbated is not a ""virgin"" anymore as they have already had sex, in the form of masturbation? 

Or why wouldn't that mean anyone who has ever had oral and/or anal sex is not a virgin anymore, as they have already has sex, in the forms of oral and anal sex? 

There are some people who still think they are ""virgins"" even if they had oral and anal sex. But if these two are forms of sexes, how can someone still be a ""virgin"" after having them? 

What even is the definition of ""virginity""? If it means ""someone who has never had sex"", then the sex includes oral and anal sex, and anyone who has ever had oral and anal sex, is not a ""virgin"" anymore. 

That's the case if masturbation and kissing are considered sex or sexual activity too. Anyone who has ever kissed someone somewhere, it doesn't have to be another mouth, or has masturbated even once is not a ""virgin"" anymore.

Theoretically, you can make up any distinction you want, and ask ""why isn't this random distinction coded in natural languages?""

linguistics,Expletive / Pleonastic / Paratactic negation in before clauses in English and Finish,"Hi everyone, I require your help. I am currently trying to find out about a particular instance of expletive negation i.e. expletive negation in so called before clauses. In German (and French as well though I won't go into this here) the negation in a negative before clause attached to a negative matrix clause is often 'expletive' i.e. it does not have a truthconditional effect and can be left out. E.g.:

&amp;#x200B;

1.  Paul will       nicht  in die Uni             kommen, bevor     er (nicht) geimpft      wurde

Paul wants  not     in the university come         before  he not     vaccinated was

Paul doesn't want to go to the university before he got vaccinated

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly, while the negator in the before-clause is optional, its presence is highly confusing (maybe even ungramamtical), if the negation in the matrix clause is absent:

2.  Paul will      ?/\*(nicht)  in die Uni             kommen, bevor     er (nicht) geimpft      wurde

Paul wants  not     in the university come         before  he not     vaccinated was

Paul doesn't want to go to the university before he got vaccinated

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to know if parallel constructions do exist in Finnish and English. For Finnish I have no clue, for English however, I did find a couple of instances via Google:

3.  Never say it won't work before you haven't tried at least once!

4. Don't go there before you haven't read my Kuala Lumpur city guide

Interestingly these two examples both include imperative matrix sentences ad I'm wondering whether this is obligatirily the case for English.

linguistics,What's the reasoning behind Proto-Polynesian having *w as opposed to *v?,"Not sure if this is the best place for this question but I haven't been having much luck trying to track down an answer in my searchings

The standard reconstruction of Proto-Polynesian has \*w, which becomes /v/ almost universally in Polynesian languages (actually even more universally than I thought until I looked at it again for this post)

Probably the most globally well-known Polynesian languages, Hawaiian and Māori (both from the Central-Eastern subfamily), are exceptions to this although even Hawaiian's /w/ has allophonic variation with \[v\]. Aside from these two, the few other Polynesian languages I can find with /w/ are apparently all fairly distant outliers in the majority non-Polynesian-speaking regions of Melanesia and Micronesia (getting my wordlists from [Pollex](https://pollex.shh.mpg.de/entry/waka.a/)).

So I'm wondering if anyone here knows any specifics behind using \*w rather than \*v in the reconstruction?

linguistics,The semantic nuances between the simple past and the perfect past in English,"***Purposes of this thread***

*1. I want to know if you guys have the same sense of the nuances I provide here*

*2. I want to know if you guys are aware of other semantic nuances between these two tense-aspects in English*

For me, in most contexts it seems that **the perfect past can be inconsequentially swapped with the simple past**; that is, no nuance is lost by using the simple past in place of the perfect past. Often times prescriptivists argue that the perfect past must be used to indicate the later of two past events when joined by a conjunction, ie: *""I had already lost the keys by the time he arrived""*, but for me at least, there is no difference if we use two simple past clauses *(""I already lost the keys by the time he arrived""*), not in meaning nor idiomatics.

But I was thinking of how to phrase something I wanted to say and by chance I used both the simple past and the perfect past in these thoughts, and I was talking about a recurrent experience in the past tense, using ""usually"", and when I used the perfect past, to me it gave the nuance of ""**distant past**"".

* *1a. ""What usually happened to me was that the effects of overtraining manifested within one day, not incrementally throughout a week.""*
* *1b. ""What usually had happened to me was that the effects of overtraining manifested within one day, not incrementally throughout a week.""*

And then I just thought of some more examples to see if the semantic effect remained

* *2a. They usually got drunk while they worked*
* *2b. They usually had gotten drunk while they worked*
* *3a. You usually boiled your cereal before you ate it.*
* *3b. You had usually boiled your cereal before you ate it.*
* *4a. I usually watched TV while stretching.*
* *4b. I had usually watched TV while stretching.*

To me, when the perfect past is used, it seems to be more **temporally distancing** and it can be even distancing in like a, ***""I disavow from it now tho""*** *type of way* (ie: *""I usually had used cheesy pick-up lines while tryna' meet women""*)

So does anyone else get a remote past or distancing sense with *""usually"" + the perfect past*?

I also have a hard time explaining this next one, but I also feel like there is a ""responsibility distancing"" or a type of ""**agency distancing**"" when I hear and use the perfect past instead of the simple past in simple sentences (*that is, sentences with only one clause*). For example, here's a dialogue:

* Person 1: ""Did you clean the kitchen yet?""
* Person 2: ""I had tried but…""

Or

*Person 1: ""Did you bake the birthday cake yet?""*

linguistics,"This week's Q&amp;A thread -- please read before asking or answering a question! - June 21, 2021","Do you have a question about language or linguistics? You’ve come to the right subreddit! We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1624273217,AutoModerator,150

linguistics,What's the opposite phenomenon to allomorphy?,"Hello there! Small premise: I'm relatively new to linguistics. I'm a sophomore at Sapienza University of Rome, where I study Linguistic and Intercultural Mediation. Last year, I took the exams of General Linguistics and of Portuguese Phonetics and Phonology. Next month, I'm going to take Portuguese Morphology and Syntax. However, while I was studying, I was assailed by doubt.

An allomorph is a phonetically different morph that realizes the same morpheme of another morph. For example, in Portuguese, **-es** is an allomorph of **-as** (and vice versa), as they both realize the morpheme **IND.PRES.2SG**:

* pt. *falas*  
fal-as  
speak-IND.PRES.2SG
* pt. *bebes*  
beb-es  
drink-IND.PRES.2SG

Is there an opposite phenomenon to allomorphy, that is when different morphemes can be realized by the same morph? For example, in French, the morphemes **IND.PRES.1SG**, **IND.PRES.2SG**, **IND.PRES.3SG** and **IND.PRES.3PL** are realized (phonetically speaking!) by the same morph:

* fr. *je* *mange* /ʒə mɑ̃ʒ/  
je mɑ̃ʒ-∅  
1SG eat-IND.PRES.1SG
* fr. *tu* *manges* /ty mɑ̃ʒ/  
tu mɑ̃ʒ-∅  
2SG eat-IND.PRES.2SG
* fr. *il* *mange* /il mɑ̃ʒ/  
il mɑ̃ʒ-∅  
3SG eat-IND.PRES.3SG
* fr. ils mangent /il mɑ̃ʒ/  
ils mɑ̃ʒ-∅  
3PL eat.IND.PRES.3PL

This is also the reason why the pronominal subjects can't be dropped in French. Otherwise, it would be impossible to understand the subject of the verb, even though this already happens, as *il mange* and *ils mangent* are pronounced in the exact same way.

At first, I thought that the same thing happens in English, as the morphemes **\*PAST.SIMPLE.1SG**, **...**, **\*PAST.SIMPLE.3PL** are realized by the same morph, **-ed**. However, the solution to this problem was easier than I thought: the morph **-ed** doesn't mark the verb's person and number, but only the tense, because it's the subject that marks them.

* en. *I worked*  
I work-ed  
1SG work-PAST.SIMPLE
* en. *you worked*  
you work-ed  
2SG work-PAST.SIMPLE

Coming back to my question, is there an opposite phenomenon to allomorphy?",1624208794,cawdtanem,3
linguistics,How does fundamental frequency of speech relate to formant ratios?,"TLDR: How does a higher fundamental frequency increase the ""frequency distance"" between formants?

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone,

I'm having real trouble understanding one small part of a paper called **'Major and minor music compared to excited and subdued speech'** 

link (no paywall):  [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel\_Bowling/publication/40896882\_Major\_and\_minor\_music\_compared\_to\_excited\_and\_subdued\_speech/links/5429126f0cf238c6ea7cf04b.pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel_Bowling/publication/40896882_Major_and_minor_music_compared_to_excited_and_subdued_speech/links/5429126f0cf238c6ea7cf04b.pdf)

I understand almost all of the paper and have a pretty good knowledge of the fundamentals of speech  production –or at least I thought I did.  What is driving me crazy is the following passage:

*The difference between the fundamental frequencies of  excited and subdued speech also affects the prevalence of specific formant ratios. Given the same voiced speech sound, the positions of the first and second formants are relatively stable between excited and subdued speech (as they must be to allow vowel phonemes to be heard correctly). The higher fundamental frequencies of excited speech, however, increase the frequency distance between harmonics, causing lower harmonics to underlie the first and second formants. As a result the F2/F1 ratios in excited speech tend to comprise smaller numbers and thus more often represent musical intervals defined by smaller number ratios. Conversely, the lower fundamental frequencies in subdued speech decrease the distance between harmonics, causing higher harmonics to underlie the formants. Thus the F2/F1 ratios in subdued speech tend to comprise larger numbers, which more often represent musical intervals defined by larger number ratios* (Pages 500 – 501).

&amp;#x200B;

1. If the positions of the first and second formants are **stable** between excited and subdued speech then how can a higher fundamental frequency ""increase the frequency distance between harmonics"" –what is meant by ""frequency distance"" in this case?
2. How does this increased frequency distance ""cause lower harmonics to underlie the first and second formant""? –what harmonics are being lowered?  (the formants have stayed where they are, the F0 has risen)
3. Not being able to understand 1 and 2 means that I can't understand how "" F2/F1 ratios in excited speech tend to comprise smaller numbers*""*

If anyone could shed any light on this I would be really really grateful

Many thanks,

linguistics,A career in linguistics and/or language/culture preservation,"Linguistics is a passion of mine, I love languages. While not being someone specifically interested in culture, I absolutely hate thinking of languages and other forms of culture and history being erased or undocumented. If I could help preserve endangered culture or language that'd be amazing. Other than that I made linguistics a hobby of mine, I've spent a lot of time studying and learning about it.

There's a few things I'm worried about though. I imagine linguists don't make much money in terms of salary... I've always been a person who want's to have my own house, property, pretty big but not extremely so. I wanted to be an astrophysicist for a lot of my life, and it actually seemed to be the only career I was interested in that made good money... $70k-$110k a year is a LOT. Expectedly, with that yearly payment there's also a lot of college you have to go through for it. In order to really work in astrophysics you have to gain a PhD, 8-10 years (at least) of rigorous uni... stuff, and I don't know if I can go through that without turning insane. There's various reasons (that I'm working on), but I'll just say I don't think it's the best idea just yet. So taking that in mind, you can imagine I don't fancy a job that pays a lot less... It might sound stupid, I *do* know with anything academic that pays well I should expect to do very hard work and to spend a long time. But things related to history, culture, literature, etc. all seem like they pay much less than other academic subjects with similar requirements. Which is very unfortunate because - other than physics - history/geography/geopolitics &amp; linguistics have been my hobby and passion. The best I can do is hope I can get myself to a point where I'm ready to take on a PhD for astro.

I'm also a very stay-at-home person, i.e. I'm not that fond of travelling to far away places to do work much. Which really conflicts with my wants to preserve culture and all, but... hey, I can get over it if it's my job. Travelling across the globe a lot and staying with some community for a while might be fun anyways.

Also I'm kind of bad at language learning (other than pronunciation and learning ABOUT the language), but that may be my own fault lol. Much worse is I've always hated and/or sucked at: Analysing texts (in English/Language class), writing constructed responses (in most classes), actually anything you'll find in your grade school native language classes other than memorising vocab.

So what I think I should do is major in physics or a similar or similar-paying field, and minor in linguistics... but I don't know, I'm nearing senior year in high school so my time to decide what I want to do to prepare me for life is running out. What are your thoughts?",1624170889,DeviantLuna,7

linguistics,Please critique my ideas on the subject of 'pronunciation vs. accent',"*tl;dr*  ***I don't see a clear difference between accent and pronunciation, to me an accent is the way you speak (pronounce) the words/sentences, it's the set of 'sound' elements that you use, and on the other hand every 'pronunciation' brings an accent along with it, there's no such thing as unaccented pronunciation, therefore it makes no sense to separate these two concepts. So those ESL teachers who make it a point to differentiate the two are either wrong or they're trying to be tactful about a controversial topic and in doing so end up describing a concept that's not exactly accurate. Am I right? Completely wrong? Please pick apart my reasoning.***

 

 Hey folks. So, basically I've taught myself English, and more recently I've been trying (also on my own) to delve a bit deeper into the phonological part of the language. Well, one thing that stood out and has been peeving me is the fact that 'mainstream' ESL teachers and content creators on the internet (and even native speakers of English who answer questions on ESL subreddits) all seem to fervently distinguish between pronunciation and accent (by accent I'm referring to the sociolinguistical concept).

To me that makes no sense, maybe I'm missing something, but if I understand correctly, pronouncing (along with the prosody) the same words differently (on a phonetic or phonemic level) is precisely what characterizes a certain accent, in fact, that's how phoneticians can describe different accents in the first place. For instance, the 'pronunciation' of the word 'certain' could be given as \[ˈsɛːɹtn̩\] for one Irish accent, \[ˈsɜːtn\] for a Southern English accent and \[ˈsɝːrtn\] for a General American accent, and to me there's no way one could pronounce 'correctly' (i.e. following the given model down to the allophones) and not sound like the one it's meant to sound. You could't read \[ˈsɛːɹtn̩\] and make it sound like the Southern English transcription.

From what I can tell, this whole 'accent =\\=. pronunciation' argument seems to be more based on common sense than on anything else. Maybe with the (noble) intention of making us ESL learners 'not worry too much' or not feel self-conscious about how we sound, which a sensitive issue, teachers will say things such as: 'work on your pronunciation but don't worry about your accent' or 'pronunciation is important but having an accent doesn't matter'.

When I hear that what I understand is that they're equating 'work on your pronunciation' with 'acquire enough elements of the English phonology to be intelligible' and 'don't worry about your accent' with 'don't go through the trouble of mastering every single element of one particular variety of English', so in fact it'd be a matter of 'how much' rather than 'whether' to make an effort to learn it or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I right in my way of thinking here, or at least on the right path? Thanks in advance!

linguistics,homophonic puns containing animals in Mandarin?,"I feel like Chinese people are obsessed with creating homophones containing animals or insects. A decade ago there were a couple that people named “the 10 Mythical Creatures”. Some were invented to get around potential censorship, but mostly people just used them for humour. A few examples:
草泥马 grass mud horse (llama) —&gt; F U
河蟹 river crab —&gt; censorship
雅蠛蝶 Yamie butterfly —&gt; derived from Japanese yamete (often heard in porn)

While most of these 10 mythical creatures are rarely seen now, new ones are constantly being invented as the online community grew larger and larger. Some of the newer ones include:
脆皮鸭文学 gay literature —&gt; crispy duck literature
鸭头 girl —&gt; duck head
乌鸡鲅鱼 I’m fking speechless —&gt; black chicken and spanish mackerel

Traditionally, there are also many associated with the Chinese new year. For example people would eat fish during spring festivals because it can form homophones with some sort of blessing. (年年有鱼)

I read that there are tons of puns in Chinese languages due to their smaller inventories and puns are a very important component of the languages. There are of course many other types of homophonic puns in Mandarin but I feel like they don’t stick around for that long compared to the ones containing living creatures.

How can it be that this sound isn't understood yet? And how can it be that this sound is only featured in Swedish?

If this sound were first found in a native Australian language or a Mayan language, something tells me it would have just been labeled as x^j or something and been done with it, but the fact that it's Swedish, perhaps one of the earliest languages they transcribed in IPA, it would have been an odd outlier. This is just my speculation of course.

Or maybe I'm wrong? Is this sound somehow really rare and special amongst world languages? 

Like what is with the one IPA character for 'that one sound in Swedish we haven't really figured out yet'? It just seems so odd given that countless other languages have been transcribed just fine.

linguistics,Mixing Politness Pronouns in French,"Hi /r/linguistics! 

Quick warning that this post contains spoilers for the show Call my Agent, I've tried to mark them where possible.

I've been watching the French Netflix show Call my Agent (Dix Pour Cent) recently, and I'm absolutely loving it. And while watching I've started to notice that the way characters use the politeness pronouns tu &amp; vous is completely different to what I'm used to in my native German.

A lot of the staff at the agency seem to switch pretty fluidly between formal and informal address, using ""tu"" in one scene and then ""vous"" in the next. I only remember one scene where Sofia openly asks Gabriel, &gt;!when he takes her on as a client!&lt;, if ""on peut se tutoyer?"". Other than that, it all seems implicit and I cannot for the life of me figure out what the rules are.

I haven't got to that part yet, but I read that there's a joke between Mathias and Noémie &gt;!after their affair has been going on for a while, he suddenly uses ""tu"" and she's all taken aback by it. I couldn't possibly imagine being intimate with someone and still addressing them formally,!&lt; that just goes against my instinct for how I relate to people around me. 

There are also some cases where an agent uses informal address to their assistant, while the assistant responds using formal address. In German this would be extremely disrespectful on part of the higher status person, the agent in this case. I can't think of any setting where a politeness imbalance is acceptable, outside of adults speaking to children. In German, if someone addresses me informally, I address them back the same way. 

I guess my question is, is this something the creators are using deliberately for humourous effect, or is politeness in French actually this fluid? Any input would be much appreciated!",1623923489,Idontevenlikecheese,17

The governor of Louisiana signed a bill that removed criminal penalties for possessing up to 14g of marijuana, making it a finable offense instead.

linguistics,Does Norwegian sound similar to Russian?,"hello!! :)
tldr; I am just wondering if anyone else hears this weird connection or (purely aural) similarities between the two languages, despite them not being historically/developmentally related (to my knowledge).
Can any linguists help me out here lol

(Context:) I am a native English speaker, am weakly/semi-fluent in Russian after learning in college (and now listen to a lot of Russian music), and have (newer/added) family in Norway (and grew up hearing bits and pieces). All of that is to explain that I am not a native speaker of either language, but my ears are quite familar with hearing both :] I do not speak Norwegian, though, and have yet to attempt learning it.


Before learning Russian (and therefore getting aquainted with the sound of it), Norwegian just sounded like what an English speaker would expect to me--Germanic + Scandinavian, lilted, kinda sweet tbh. After learning Russian, I would be on video calls with my family, get distracted, hear them speaking, and my brain would go, this sounds like Russian??? and then a few seconds later it would go away. I've been hearing these sort of similarities right when I hear Norwegian ever since. Just now I was listening to a song (new to me) where the artist sings in English, then sings in Norwegian at the end and in trying to identify it, I thought it was Russian at first with the words, 
""Nummer en: pust
Aldri, aldri hold pusten
Nummer to: pust langsomt
Og dypt
Nummer tre: ikke mist pusten
Nummer fire: om et problem oppstår, stopp og senk angsten med langsom, dyp pust""

I was trying to find explanations, and the only brainstorming I have is: 
These lyrics/this passage sounded like it could be Russian (to me) up until ""langsomt,"" with the sort of swallowed ng vowel... and as the vowels started to be more open/elongated. 
Is it the way that you hit/place the consonants in your mouth (e.g. in ""pust"" and ""aldri"")? A lot of languages have rolled/flipped r's, and r's are definitely less emphasized/shorter in Norwegian, so it's not just that. Is it the way that some words are constructed that sounds so similar; do the consonant combinations reflect Russian more than some other languages do? Plus they both use a good amount of palatization, but my family is from southern Norway where they don't  even really do that?? 
Or do the smaller letter pairings/chunks in Norwegian that line up with patterns in common Russian words (I am no linguist, I am sure there are better terminologies/ways to explain these things...)?

There is obviously a significant lilt with pitch accents for Norwegian that is not present in Russian, but I feel like there is still some similarity there? Am I crazy lol. In Russian, the length and quality of the vowel matters more, but the pitch direction of a phrase can change the meaning entirely, so pitch does still matter... In my personal experience with Russian, I feel like words consistently have specific ways in which they roll off the tongue--in that there are specific stresses/an emphasized vowel in each word that shape how the rest of the word as well. I know that it's not the same as a pitch-accent, but is there any connection between where pitch-accents are placed in Norwegian words and stresses are placed in Russian? They just sound so damn similar in my ear sometimes, I don't understand.


So yeah... I tried to do some research on these languages' linguistic histories, but every where I looked, I could not find any connections. Norwegian is a Germanic language and uses a variation of the Roman alphabet, while Russian is a Slavic language and uses the Cyrillic alphabet... They're both Indo-European, but many other languages are as well, that do not sound so eerily alike to me! I tried to see if there were historical reasonings that would facilitate any aural relationship between them, or a relationship with word construction/stress shapings, or vowel/consonant patterns (again, there are better terms for these that I don't know eek!)... but I couldn't find anything. 
There was a pigeon language between the two that developed, but that was after they were both pretty established. Does the geographical proximity have anything to do with it? You would think that if proximity did in fact have any affect, it would be more evident in their earlier developments or anywhere at all... Gahhhhh. 

I guess this connection is more phonological and less historical, but how does that make sense???? Bruh. Am I crazy.


*Also for less important context, Russian and English are the only two languages I speak, but I watch a good amount of ""foreign"" films/shows and listen to music in different languages often too (e.g. Spanish, East-Asian languages, Hindi, Arabic, French?)... so my ear is, ~somewhat~ attuned to listening to languages I either don't know at all, or know very select words from (I hope this doesn't sound annoying, I just want to clarify that these two languages aren't the only two I hear LOL)
And for clarities sake, I don't often listen to/hear German, Portuguese, the many languages throughout Africa (I am so sorry!!! I very critically need to expand on that and appreciate these languages/cultures better off-paper eekk), Baltic or Balkan, Middle-Eastern  languages other than Arabic, other Germanic like Danish, Dutch, and extant languages, or Oceanic/South-East Asian languages. 
Sooo there are many tongues I am not at all familiar with hearing that could/do carry similarities to Russian, and could attune my ear differently if I was.

linguistics,Languages where vowelless sentences are possible,"So I’m trying to compile a list of languages in which (grammatically correct) sentences containing no vowels are possible. I’ve already found a few languages with a relatively high frequency of vowelless words (Nuxalk, Czech, Miyakoan, and Shilha) where a few can be formed (Czech actually has a bit of it a penchant for it), but I’m curious about more, and online most of what I can find are blog posts or forum discussions where people frankly have no clue what they’re talking about and bringing stuff up like the so-called “vowelless English words” *sky*, *rhythm*, etc. or similarly supposed “vowelless” words in Welsh where y and w are used to represent vowels.

To clarify exactly what I’m *not* interested in:

- nothing where “y” or “w” are used orthographically to represent vowels. These are still vowel phonemes, it doesn’t matter which letters you use to represent them. This is something I literally learned in elementary school; “y” and “w” can act as vowels in English (and many other languages). They don’t count. Same with epenthetic unwritten /ə/ inserted in consonant clusters, or other orthographic quirks like “v” being a vowel in Cherokee or Old Latin. Semi-vowel usage of /j/ or /w/ is fine so long as it is in fact those phonemes and there are no accessory true vowels. Know the difference.

- joke coinages and neologisms that basically no one uses don’t count as vowelless words

- on a similar note; I’m only interested in natural languages here. I love conlangs, but anyone can construct a language without any vowels at all, so I feel like that’d kind of be cheating here 

- on the topic of the epenthetic schwa thing above; I know there are some languages where whether or not one occurs between some consonants is debated and maybe dialectal. That’s fine, just nothing where it’s pretty much a universal feature of pronunciation like in the English *rhythm*

- No. Abjads. Yes, I’m well aware there are writing systems where vowels aren’t written, I did (briefly) learn Hebrew growing up. These do not count; once again, just because vowels aren’t written does not mean they aren’t there. Mentioning Hebrew as a supposed example of a “vowelless language” is probably the second most common bad answer to this question after Welsh

- probably barely worth mentioning, but sign languages, while technically languages without any vowels, or consonants, obviously aren’t what I’m looking for here 

Sorry if that list comes off as pissy, I’m just *so* tired of getting these same non-answers based on totally mistaken reasoning and wanted to clear things up in advance. Thank you in advance for any legit examples",1623783045,regular_modern_girl,128

linguistics,Unfamiliar/niche usage of 'thought for',"My wife and I have an interesting relationship within English. We're both native speakers of English, she's from Kansas, I'm from Oregon, though we live together in Germany. The biggest difference in our backgrounds is that she's spent most of the last 20 years living in France or Germany. 

Needless to say, this has affected her English in all the fun little ways (such as ""When will we see us again"" from the German usage of uns) that you come to expect of speaking a more international English. 

Usually we can agree on an affected moment, though there are time that I've been surprised to find an oddity left over from her growing up in Kansas, just as I've been learning ones from my childhood (apparently words like klootch and skookum are not common). This time, however, we've come to an impasse.

When describing an item or actions intent, she will say things to the effect of ""Well, it was thought for this purpose"" or ""I don't think that this is what the item was thought for.""

I'm at a loss, and we can't agree on where it comes from. It's not directly a German construction, and I'm not good enough at French to know the difference. Googling has produced no usage I can find. But she is adamant that it's a standard usage in her experience, and has used it long enough that our daughter uses it in her English as well.

I'm not trying to make a gotcha out of this, far from. I just want to know where the heck this comes from. Maybe one of you is familiar with this usage?",1623670710,ThatGuyWhoPostsShit,10

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1623668418,AutoModerator,288

I want to improve my articulation, and I'm looking for well-established frameworks that I could apply when learning &amp; practicing how to properly communicate ideas.



Are there concepts/principles/theories which I could use when learning how to articulate? Here are some of my ideas, which may already have well-established principles out there:

1. Process of articulating (for example, step 1 is to formulate ideas, step 2 is to do this and that, and so on)

2. Patterns of expressing ideas (eg. expressing thoughts in a narrative format; or having an analytical approach of articulating an idea; or explaining an idea by being symbolic, etc.)

3. Dimensions/aspects of articulation (perhaps something like vocabulary, patterns of introducing an idea, order of ideas to present when speaking, etc.)

4. Considerations in articulating based on specific contexts (eg. how to appropriately deliver a message that is bad news for the receiver; or considering the relationship with the receiver in expressing your message, like your boss vs your friend; speaking in an informal setting vs delivering a speech)

5. Well-established rules on how to structure the words of a sentence / sentences of a paragraph in order to portray a specific feeling/meaning (eg. if you mention X before Y, the receiver would think/feel A; if you mention Y before X, the receiver would think/feel B; if you omit X and only express Y, the receiver would think/feel C)

6. Rules of communication in general (whether it be something technical in linguistics, or even something like eg. rules in building relationships through dialogue)




Do you know any well-established concepts (or maybe even articles) that may answer any of these things I have mentioned, or in some way could help explain the art of articulating ideas/feelings?

linguistics,Confusion regarding the Geordie accent's MOUTH and GOOSE vowels,"The modern Geordie accent is described as having a backed GOOSE vowel /u:/. The thing is, /u:/ is also described as being the traditional pronunciation of the MOUTH lexical set. The Modern Geordie accent now uses /aʊ/ for most words which once had /u:/, though there are exceptions where /u:/ is still used. Now this where my confusion begins. The northernmost accents of England, as well as the Scots language, never participated in the Great Vowel Shift of /u:/ to /aʊ/, but the GOOSE vowel itself was never raised to /u:/ but rather was fronted and raised to  /y:/ or /ʉ:/. Now this begs some questions:

1) Why does Geordie have a backed GOOSE vowel? Was the vowel once fronted but later backed? Or was it always backed? If it was always backed, (see the next question)

2) Does Geordie variably merge the MOUTH and GOOSE lexical sets? That is, can the words ""town"" and ""toon"" rhyme? Or is there some subtle difference between these vowels?

3) Is it possible that once Geordie adopted the /aʊ/ diphthong as a possible pronunciation in the MOUTH lexical set, that this caused them to completely abandon the traditional /y:/ GOOSE phoneme and instead transfer their traditional /u:/ of MOUTH to GOOSE? Which in turn would make the GOOSE lexical set use /u:/ exclusively, while MOUTH would vary between the introduced /aʊ/ phoneme and the traditional  /u:/.",1623449305,MasterLinguist,6

I'm not going to talk badly about my mentor because she's been helpful but not to the extent to which I need it, really. That's why I'm here. 
Also, I'm not a native English speaker and I come from a third world country that's far away from the US.

I have already established what a language variety is, a dialect and accent but still, what I'm confused about now is what dialect to investigate because honest to God, I'm not sure if Standard American English has one unified dialect. I read that there's a Midland dialect, for instance. 
Moreover, Labov's studies are mostly focused on dialects in terms of pronunciation but since I'm not able to collect the data and analyze speech, my mentor told me to focus on syntax.

Then, I haven't been able to find a lot, if not any, literature about prestige linguistic forms in American dialects. I'm panicking because my deadline is approaching and I don't have the access to any database to retrieve the books related to anything similar to my topic. I also don't have any money to purchase books on google so all in all, I have 10 books about Sociolingusitics in general and a lot of articles about language and gender written from the femminist point of view.

When speaking to a North Korean, do you immediately realize it? Would it be akin to an American English speaking person hearing a British English speaking person?

What do you think when you hear it? I have read it can be mistaken as “rude” but do you know it’s a North Korean so you don’t get offended, or do people actually sometimes think they’re just a rude South Korean person?

linguistics,Dark L (ɫ) in Brazilian Portuguese?,"For some time now I’ve been struggling to come to terms with the pronunciation of Brazilian Portuguese, more specifically with the letter L.

Most sources I’ve come across distinguish between three possible realizations: /l/, /w/, and /ʎ/. This is all pretty clear. 

However, when listening to certain words supposedly pronounced with a light [l]-sound, I seem to be picking up on a dark [ɫ]-sound. 

Take the pronoun pair “ele” vs “ela” (he/she) as an example. They’re supposedly pronounced as /ˈe.li/ and /ˈɛ.lɐ/, respectively. What I hear, however, is /ˈe.li/ and /ɛ.ɫɐ/. The [ɫ] also seems to be present in other words like “lapa” and “vila”.

From what I’ve gathered the sound is commonly found in European Portuguese in word final position, but I can’t seem to find any evidence of it being present in the Brazilian spoken variety. Why is this? Am I imagining the sound as a result of proximity to the rather closed [ɐ], or is there another reason? Is the dark L merely an allophone of the phoneme /l/, and if so, what is the tendency among native speakers to use one or the other?

linguistics,Interesting Etymology of the Korean word chacihata (차지하다),"Hi! I'd like talk about a very extreme case of [spelling pronunciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelling_pronunciation) that happened in Korean.

In Korean, there is a very common verb 차지하다 *chacihata* that means ""to claim, to take up (space)"". Here are some example sentences (all romanization is done in Yale):

* 우리 반은 여학생이 80%를 **차지한다**. *wuli pan-un yehaksayng-i palsip pulwo-lul* **chaciha-n-ta**

  Our class-TOPIC female_student-NOM eighty percent-ACC **take_up**-PRES-DECL

  ""Female students take up 80% of our class.""

* 카이사르는 루비콘 강을 건너 정권을 **차지했다**. *khaisalu-nun lwupikhwon kang-ul kenn-e cengkwen-ul* **chaciha-yess-ta**

  Caesar-TOPIC Rubicon River-ACC cross-CONN power-ACC **seize**-PAST-DECL

  ""Caesar **seized** power by crossing the Rubicon River.""

This Modern Korean word *chacihata*, comes from the Middle Korean word *kozomalta* ""to deal with"". How in the world?

To understand this, you need to know how [Idu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idu_script) works. Idu is a writing system that was used to write Korean using Chinese Characters, until it slowly faded out of usage after the invention and proliferation of Hangul. In Idu, Koreans often used a certain Chinese character with a related meaning to represent a certain Korean word or a sound. If you know Japanese, this is very similar to kun'yomi, and it's called 석독(釋讀) *sektwok* (literally 'meaning-reading') in Korea. In other cases, Koreans used a Chinese character with a related pronunciation to represent a Korean word or a sound (音讀, *umtwok* ""sound-reading""), or a mix of the two systems, where the first part represents the meaning, and the second part represents the (partial) sound (末音添記法, *malumchemki'pep* ""final sound addition method""). I will focus on *sektwok* in this post.

For example, in Classical Chinese, the character 是 (pronounced /d͡ʑiᴇ/ in Middle Chinese, 시 *si* in Sino-Korean) meant ""this"". ""this"" in Korean is 이 *i*. So, 是 is used to represent the sound 이 *i* in Idu (*sektwok*). But also, 是 was used to represent the Korean sound *si* too (*umtwok*).

Then how do you write *kozomalta* in Idu?

First, you break the word apart: *kozomalta* is a compound that consists of two parts, *kozom* ""tool, material"" + *alta* ""to manage"".

Now, what's a Chinese character that has a meaning similar to *kozom* ""tool, material""? It's 資 (MC /t͡siɪ/, *co* in Sino-Korean) which means ""money, material"". However, the character 資 looks too complex, so let's just take the top part 次 (MC /t͡sʰiɪ/, Sino-Korean *cho*) and use that to write *kozom* instead. 次 has a meaning on its own, ""second"", but let's just ignore that.

What about *alta* ""to manage""? Actually, *alta* is a homophone: it can also mean ""to know"". The Chinese character for ""to know"" is 知 (MC /ʈiᴇ/, Sino-Korean *ti*). So let's use 知 to write *alta*.

So, combining the two characters above, we get 次知, which represents the Middle Korean word *kozomalta*.

As you can see from the discussion so far, writing a Korean word in Idu is not that difficult. However, *reading* it successfully back to the intended word is much more difficult to figure out! So, a lot of the time, people just read the Chinese characters using Sino-Korean pronunciation instead (*umtwok*), even though it was intended to be read using some other method (e.g. *sektwok* or *malumchemki'pep*).

Over time, as more and more people read 次知 as the Sino-Korean pronunciation *choti* instead of proper *sektwok* reading of *kozomalta*, the meaning shifted as well, from ""to deal with"" to ""to be in charge of"" to ""to claim"" and ""to take up (space)"". Also, historical sound changes made *choti* into *chaci* (vowel shift *o* &gt; *a*, palatization *ti* &gt; *ci*). Along with this, with a verb-making suffix -*hata*, it became the modern form *chacihata*.

The original form of the word, *kozomalta*, still survives in Modern Korean dictionaries as 가말다 *kamalta*, but its usage is extremely rare. (I was only able to find two occurences in any Modern Korean corpus.)",1623317160,mujjingun,41

linguistics,Reduplication of 'too',"Something I notice that I do without even thinking about, that I'm not aware where I got this from or who else does it, is the reduplication of 'too'.

As in ""I hope it's not *too* too crowded"" with a sort of stress placed on the first 'too'.

The way that I interpret this meaning, is that 'too too' is an excess of something in a situation where more excess is allowed than 'too'.

For example, If 1 is just the right amount and 10 is way too much, then 'too' is maybe a 3 and 'too too' is maybe a 7.

The difference between ""I hope it's not *too* too crowded"" and ""I hope it's not too crowded"" is that in the first sentence, I could tolerate a bit more of a crowd then in the second example.

Does anyone recognize this at all, does anyone else do this, and has there been any literature on the subject? (I did look it up but found nothing)

Edit: after thinking about it, I'd also do the same thing with 'that' and 'so' as in ""not *that* that bad"" or ""not *so* so common"" but I think these are less common.",1623277794,Strobro3,7

linguistics,Are Homophones necessary?,"In most cases homophones are used in very different context. In this case I don't think they are necessary, you can use one word in different contexts and it makes sense. 

I personally verbally say their and there the same way, no distinguishes and doing this I never come into any problems. Where and were are different I pronounce them differently, but even if I said the same thing (making it a true homophone) they are completely different contexts, so using where or were in all cases would still make sense. The only cases homophones should be distinguished is in cases where context is the same such as I am fat, or I am phat, either case its confusing, one I am large the other I am muscular, saying it out loud is confusing. 

Tbh, in either case, the case where distinguishing is unnecessary (their and there), and distinguishing is necessary (phat and fat). In the first case distinguishing it is unnecessary context fixes the problem, so why make the distinction, in the other case distinguishing is necessary, but because they sound the same you verbally have to state the distinction, otherwise what your trying to convey could be wrong. So it just seems like homophones are completely broken, either you are writing unnecessary distinctions other than because that's how it is, or their needs to be a distinction, but verbally their isn't making it confusing.

TL:DR, when two different homophones are **only** used in **different** contexts, their is no need to distinguish the two, when homophones are **only** used in the **same** context, they should verbally be different and not homophones to begin with. Either case homophones are useless. 

So am I just being stupid, or are homophones actually useful?",1623258188,Skippers101,2

linguistics,Art is strange in Sweden,"Please let me know if this question would work better in r/translator!

In Swedish it’s quite common to combine the words “konst” and “konstigt” (art and strange/weird) to play with the alliteration. It’s quite common that even museums or other institutions use these types of alliterations in their educational programs. For example: a children’s activity could be called “konst eller konstigt?” (art or weird?).

I’m wondering if this is common in other languages too. To describe art as something odd. Or is it just the fact that it’s an alliteration that has led to the consistent pairing of art and strange/weird in Sweden? If it is, I wonder how that affects how Swedish speakers think of art. Being trained from a young age to make the connection between konst (art) and konstigt (weird).

I think there is an etymological connection between both “konst” and “konstigt” as they seem to be derived from the German “Kunst”. However these days the words are completely separate in meaning.

As an art educator I guess I’m bothered by the habit of saying that art is weird! I guess the reason behind it is to open up for discussion and to acknowledge that art indeed can appear strange sometimes. But I worry that it mostly cements the idea that arts is something crazy.

I would happily accept suggestions on texts that could help me understand if there indeed a potential connection between the use of certain words and changes in how people behave. I remember reading something about how humans are more likely to believe something if it rhymes. Eg. “an apple a day keeps the doctor away”.",1623237751,Kattbild,19

linguistics,Is or has eastern Norwegian shifted closer to East NGmc?,"The traditional divide between East NGmc (Swedish and Danish) and West NGmc (Icelandic, Faroese) I feel accounts fairly well for some of the main structural differences these two zones have, but I feel like at least eastern Norwegian, exemplified by Austland dialects and bokmål, is in many ways closer to East NGmc than West. The features that currently come to mind:

* strong and 1st weak presents merged with 2nd/3rd weak presents (bm. *jeg kommer, jeg ligger* sv. *jag kommer, jag ligger* VS is. *ég kem, ég ligg* nn. *eg kjem, eg ligg*)
* partial monophthongisation (bm. sv. *ben, øst/öst* VS is. nn. *bein, aust*), with numerous exceptions (da. sv. *ø/ö* VS bm. nn. *øy* is. *eyja*)
* geminate depalatalisation (sv. *ligga* bm *ligge* VS is. nn. *liggja* (+ variants))

There are of course things that e.g. bokmål doesn't do that ENGmc does (such as unmarked possessive constructions of the type PRON + INDEF as opposed to DEF + PRON), and some that nynorsk shares with Danish that Swedish and bokmål don't do (nn. *born* da. *børn* is. *börn* VS sv. bm. *barn*); but this all paints me a confusing picture.

linguistics,Does English have less of a written-spoken difference than other languages with long literary traditions?,"Even ignoring extreme cases like Tamil or Arabic, where the formal variety has not been spoken colloquially since the Middle Ages, it seems like English has less fundamental (i.e. non-lexical) differences between its spoken and written forms than many other languages:

* Many languages have various conjugations nowadays largely reserved to the written form: French simple past, Persian future, Welsh verbal morphology, Korean *hada* forms. There is nothing like this in English.
* Many languages have etymologically unrelated literary and spoken words for terms as basic as the prepositions ""in"" (Persian *dar* vs. *tu*) and ""to"" (Korean *ege* vs. *hante*), the conjunction ""and"" (Burmese *hníñ* vs. *né*), or the pronoun ""we"" (French *nous* vs. *on*). I can't think of anything like this in English.

And this isn't just an issue of formality, even children's books are often written in this literary grammar that nobody speaks in normally.

Even with the vocabulary, it feels that there's much more of a vocabulary difference between written and spoken registers in the languages I've mentioned above than in English.

And while some English dialects do have a big difference from the written standard form, there actually are many people who speak in a grammar close to the standard form, which I feel isn't the case for the languages I've mentioned above.

Apparently this is due to de-emphasis of ṣ in a manner similar to [Geers' law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geers%27_law) for Akkadian, but it seemed strange to me that it would become ś ([ɬ] in Ancient Hebrew) and not plain s. Unless. Some time ago, I read that Arabic ض, proto-Semitic ḍ, was likely originally pronounced [ɮˤ]. I also know that Hebrew letters ח and ע had double pronunciations in ancient Hebrew preserving different proto-Semitic consonants, so it made me think - maybe צ had two pronunciations as well? If צ in צחוק was actually pronounced [ɮˤ], it de-emphasizing and then devoicing to become [ɬ], the closest counterpart to [ɮ], seems to be much more likely than [sˤ] randomly becoming lateral [ɬ] instead of just staying at plain [s]. So צ seems to have had two pronunciations, the well known [sˤ] but also [ɮˤ].

I'm really not an expert on this, and I guess it depends whether you reconstruct  ancient Hebrew ṣ as pharyngealized, ejective or affricate, but this double pronunciation theory seems to me to make a lot of sense. It's just one word though, and I can't find another example of ṣ becoming ś. Also, the version of the word with ś  appears mostly in the later books of Proverbs, Job and Ecclesiastes so perhaps by that time ś had merged into s.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1623063613,AutoModerator,278

At which level of linguistic structure does this dialectal variation exist?"" I answered with syntactic, but the correct answer turns out to be morphological.

Both of these statements sound dreadfully reductionist to me, not least because the 1979 version of the IPA (which I have in print) lists ɕ and ʃʲ separately. Neither statement is cited. Are Wikipedia's editors just making things up or misunderstanding, or are these equivalences attested in some professional literature? If so, where?  
Likewise, Wikipedia's [own version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:IPA_navigation) of the IPA consonant chart lists the alveolo-palatals as being purely palatal ‘sibilant fricatives’, ç and ʝ being the ‘non-sibilant fricatives’.

linguistics,Designed languages for nation and identity building purposes vs more or less naturally evolved and standardised languages,"Modern Turkish and Hebrew are newly created languages (designed languages so to speak) on an older language basis, Ottoman Turkish, and Classical Hebrew respectively, to the point that mutual intelligibility between the two modern languages and their predecessors, respectively, is very hard if not impossible. Often this phenomenon of ""creating a new language"" so to speak, follows the creation of a nation/state or its reformation. Modern Hebrew and modern Turkish exist because of nation creating efforts, otherwise Turks would continue to speak Ottoman Turkish (or spoken varieties; Ottoman Turkish apparently had 88% of its vocabulary borrowed from Arabic and Persian, today's language is full of neologisms when these foreign words were replaced) , and Jews would continue to read Classical Hebrew and speak Yiddish, Ladino and many other languages.

I contrast this phenomenon with the more common one, where a certain dialect or variant will become the basis for the standard language during a unification or becoming a nation state (e.g. the Fiorentine dialect in Italian or High German variety as the basis for standard German, or the way Macedonian emerged from South Slavic (arguably Bulgarian) varieties). (I'm not sure where to classify Greek in this respect, is modern Greek a newly designed language or a natural continuation of a spoken variety?)

What is this phenomenon of creating a new language for nation building purposes called? I mean not the standardisation, but the design language phenomenon. What are the factors for it to succeed? It's amazing how quickly people became fluent in modern Hebrew and modern Turkish. It's an explosive success, was it only possible because of technology advancements like mass media (radio, tv, press)? What are some other languages like this?

linguistics,Better way to order english alphabet,"i propose a better way to order english alphabet, becos the original dont make sense. this ordering method can be generalised to order other langs' alphabet, and even IPA too.

rules for ordering letters:

1. vowels &gt; consonants

vowel order:

1. open vowels &gt; close vowels
2. front vowels &gt; back
3. unrounded &gt; round

(ie left to right, bottom to top on ipa vowel chart)

conso order:

1. conso articulation place front &gt; back
2. conso manner sonority low &gt; high (aspirated&gt;tenuis&gt;voiced, stop&gt;affricate&gt;fricative&gt;nasal&gt;approximant), then central&gt;lateral within the same manner
3. if a letter is pronounced differently from ipa, use the pronunciation in the language
4. if a letter can have &gt;1 sound, use the prototypical one (/ɡ/ for g, /ks/ for x)
5. if a letter is pronounced as a sequence of sound, put letter after the monoarticulated ones with the 1st sound of that sequence (/ks/ for x, and put it after all the k-like sounds and before g)
6. coarticulated sound letters treated similarly, but put any 2ndary and further articulations after the monoarticulated version (ie w after ɰ if language have both)
7. if multiple letters share the same sound, sort by their ipa pronunciation, but keep them grouped together insted of moving to new position

linguistics,Linguistic prescriptivism and non-native speakers?,"I live in a community where English is the lingua franca. There are frequently situations where people say things that would probably sound like a mistake to native English speakers, such as saying “borrow” when they mean “lend”, and vice versa. Most of the time the meaning still comes across, thanks to relevant contexts.

I got curious so I started reading around on this subject. One of the articles frequently mentioned is [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/\~myl/languagelog/archives/003588.html](http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003588.html). Based on what written there, if someone insists that people in my community use the words “lend” and “borrow” as explained in dictionaries, that would be considered inappropriate prescriptivism, as the meaning of the sentences are still clearly understood, so there’s no loss in useful distinction, and furthermore there’s no intentional twisting of words to promote some agenda. On the other hand, I’m hesitant to say this is a natural linguistic change, but rather an error on the part of the speakers when learning English: most of them, when explained what’s funny about the situation, realize that they’ve associated “lend” and “borrow” with the opposite words, respectively, in their own languages.

I find it interesting to think of this in comparison to an example in English: “I’m down for a game tonight” and “I’m up for a game tonight” both mean the same thing. Yet I can’t say for sure that the two situations are entirely similar, or even comparable.

What is everyone’s take on this?",1622801162,ensbana,24
linguistics,Is Japanese difficulty overrated compared to say French?,"Imagine you had 100 babies that had to learn French till like age 10 and 100 that had to learn Japanese.

Wouldn't Japanese be way easier?

French is supposedly an easyy easy language for Germanic speakers (Dutch, Swedish, english) but when I had to practise French I hated it because there are so many things you have to "" bruteforce""  into your brain that have no logical reasoning behind them. Like female words vs male words, grammar which has tonnes of exceptions.

While Japanese was modernized in 1900. The way you write it is exactly how youre going to pronounce it, there are no "" silent ""  characters or exceptions, it is a logical system. 

The Kanji will be difficult yes, but even those all have a logical reasoning. Theyre basically stylized pictogramsand if you understand the radicals you can get a good sense of what they mean even if you havent seen them before.


In general thisi s something I find with Japanese, it is all, very logical with only a few exceptions that you need to memorize and most of those also have a logical reasoning behind why they are exceptions. In my native language, and French, logical reasoning is only minor part of why things are written a certain way and tradition is more important.

linguistics,Vowel Harmony in Tamil?,"So, I'll start off by saying that I couldn't find any literature on this, but that's probably a given, with Tamil diglossia and this being a *very* spoken Tamil thing.

I noticed that when certain vowels occur next to some other ones, there are some shifts that happen. Let me given an example:

The word kēvalam(disgusting, ugly) is pronounced **[kæːʋʌlɔ̃]** by me. I'm not sure which dialect this usually happens to, but I feel like it's most modern dialects. Here's what I observed:

e -&gt; æ, o -&gt; ɔ (with lengths preserved) when they occur next to *a* (ə/ʌ) ā**, *e ē*, *o ō*.

This is really clear when we take conjugated forms of some works, for example

* kēḷu [keːɭɯ] (imperative of ""to ask"") and kēkkata [kæːkːaːdʌ] (""don't ask"") and kēlēn [kæːlɛ̃(ː)] (""please ask"")
* nēru [neːɾɯ] (straight, noun) and nērā(ka) [næːɾaː] (straightly, adverb)
* sollu [solːɯ] (""say"", imperative) and sollāta [sɔlːaːtʌ] (""don't say"")
* pēru [peːɾɯ] (name) and pēran [pæːɾʌ̃] (grandson)

Could someone point me to some literature about this, if it does exist? If not, could other Tamil speakers/linguists confirm if this is vowel harmony or if this is simply something else? And also, could someone confirm if their dialect does this too? And to what extent?",1622733618,OhItsuMe,17

So how would I put these on me CV? Are all three of them my mother tongue? I'm so confused. I'm quite fluent in all of them, but I'd say language A is the weakest. 

Is mother tongue the language you acquire first? What about the early (age 3) simultaneous exposure of the additional language B and C? Which are also stronger than the first one I acquired.

linguistics,Question about taxonomy of adjective classes,"I'm not a linguist, but a psychologist who is dabbling in NLP, so apologies if this is a silly or uninformed question...

Is there a name for adjectives that refer to actions or contexts? For example, ""He is silly"" has an adjective that describes a characteristics of an individual, but ""Bicycle riding is boring"" has an adjective that describes a broader context or activity.

Is there a term that differentiates between those two kinds of adjectives (or more kinds)? I've been hitting Google/Google Scholar, but I haven't been able to find much, perhaps because I have no idea what terms I should be looking for.",1622567042,malenkydroog,2

linguistics,Etymological insights shed new light on ancient oracle,"Runecentric is a new handbook on rune symbolism that employs Afrikaans, one of the youngest languages in  the world, among others, as a lens through which to dissect the archetypal origins and significations of the the runic mindset. The third most spoken language in South Africa, Afrikaans evolved from the Dutch vernacular of the seventeenth century settlers. It's a Germanic language derivative, related to Old High German and Old Norse. But why use Afrikaans as a nexus to the Nordic mindset, when the language would appear so watered down over time? Why not have chosen earlier Dutch, OHG or even ON itself? The answer is because that's been done already and also because the author is South African. Interestingly, it would appear that Afrikaans - as distant as it might seem from its northern ancestry - has retained nuggets of its etymological roots that still rings true, providing a tool that sheds nuanced insight into an otherwise well-aired subject.",1622562052,VitkiMuse,2

linguistics,"This week's Q&amp;A thread -- please read before asking or answering a question! - May 31, 2021","Do you have a question about language or linguistics? You’ve come to the right subreddit! We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1622458822,AutoModerator,196

I'm really interested in hearing other people's thoughts on this article. :)

I believe that the concept of “ungrammatical” or “ill-formed” word-sequences is a delusion, based on a false conception of the kind of thing a human language is. 
The remainder of the article explains his understanding of the concept of Grammaticality, and provides both theoretical and empirical arguments against it.

linguistics,"One of the theories about Etruscan proposes that it may be related to the Pre-Greek substrate: multiple linguistic features are shared by the 2 languages, but nowadays an autochthonous origin of the Etruscans is considered more probable than an Aegean origin. So is this theory still possible?","This may be a long post, sorry for that, a **TLDR is that most archeological and genetic evidence goes against this theory, while linguistic evidence (might) be in favor of it.**   
*I also included a summary of this post towards the end. The word list occupies a lot of space in this post, so don't worry, it's not as long as it looks; you can simply read the compared words without the explanations.*

I'll list the evidence against and in favor of this theory.

**EVIDENCE AGAINST THE THEORY**

The 2 main theories about the origin of the Etruscans propose that:

1. they were either autochthonous to Italy (possibly a continuation of the Proto-Villanovan culture);
2. hey had migrated from the Aegean sea, as claimed by two Greek historians: Herodotus, who described them as a group of immigrants from Lydia in Anatolia, and Hellanicus of Lesbos who claimed that the Tyrrhenians were the Pelasgians *(pre-greeks, considered the speakers of the Pre-Greek substrate language)* originally from Thessaly, Greece, who entered Italy at the head of the Adriatic sea.

Archeological and genetic research seems to point towards the first theory. I quote from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_origins):

&gt;According to modern scholars, and specifically etruscologists, all the evidence gathered so far points to an indigenous origin of the Etruscans. Moreover, there is no archeological evidence for a migration of the Lydians or the Pelasgians into Etruria. The earliest evidence of a culture that is identifiably Etruscan dates from about 900 BC: this is the period of the Iron Age Villanovan culture, considered to be the earliest phase of Etruscan civilization, which itself developed from the previous late Bronze Age Proto-Villanovan culture in the same region.

I feel that the [Italian article](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipotesi_sull%27origine_degli_Etruschi) is more complete, and offers more sources (especially regarding genetic research). Genetic analysis on Etruscan samples shows that there is **very little genetic difference between Etruscans and Latins (or, more generally, Indo-Europeans), but for some reason, the Etruscans maintained a Pre-Indo-European language.** The same situation is found with the Basque: they are genetically close to the 'Steppe peoples', but at the same time they're one of the few non-Indo-European speakers of Europe. This probably means that (in both cases) the IndoEuropean immigrating population mixed with the previous pre-IE population who lived in those lands during the Neolithic, and the pre-IE language was kept rather than the IE language.

This genetic and archeological evidence is the biggest evidence *against* the theory that Etruscan is related to Pre-Greek [(the non-Indo-European language spoken in Greece before Indo-Europeans arrived, which left many loanwords in the Greek language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Greek_substrate).

**EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF THE THEORY**

**SUFFIXES**

The previously mentioned evidence would point against the theory, but there are elements in favor of this theory too, like the following 4 suffixes:

* **the suffix** ***-nn-*** is found very often in both Etruscan and Pre-Greek, but never/almost never in Indo-European. For example, the ethnonym of Etruscans (their autonym at least) is '*Rasenna*', and many Etr. family names such as *Spurinna* have this suffix too. Pre-Greek examples are ἀγάννα, βλέννος, γίννος, λαχάννα, Δίκτυννα...
* **the suffix** ***-nt-*** is found very often in both Etruscan and Pre-Greek, but never/almost never in Indo-European. For example, the Roman family name '*Antonius*', which was of Etruscan origin. Pre-Greek examples are ἀσκάνθης, ὀκρίβας; φάλανθ/τος, Ἄβαντες, Μέλανθ/τ-, Πείρανθ/τ-, Γίγαντε, Κορύβαντες...
* **the suffix** ***-mn-*** is found very often in both Etruscan and Pre-Greek, and sometimes in Indo-European too. One of the major Etruscan deities, *Voltumna*, contained *-mn-*. Pre-Greek examples are ϝεδιμνος, ἴαμνος, βασυμνιάτης, κρημνός, λάμνα, λωρυμνόν, μέριμνα, ῥόδαμνος, σίγυμνον, σίδριμνον...
* **the suffix** ***-rn-*** is found very often in both Etruscan and Pre-Greek, but never/almost never in Indo-European. Robert Beekes considers it one of the major similarities between Etruscan and Pre-Greek. Etruscan examples are *Turnu*, *parniχ*, *marniu*; Pre-Greek examples are ἀκαρνάν (ἀκάρναξ), κυβερνάω, λιπερνέω (also λιφ-), σκέπαρνος...

*(The Pre-Greek words were all left in their Greek forms since we do not have direct attestation of Pre-Greek. I sometimes removed the Greek nominative endings when romanizing, since they are Indo-European).*

* The first 4 words are 'basic' terms, which makes it unlikely to imagine that they were loanwords.
* Welkhans *may* be a loanword - but the Minoans were never in contact with the Etruscans since the 2 civilizations lived in different periods.
* The 6th and 7th terms, *aska* and *ampile*, might be loanwords. The Greek words themselves are of Pre-Greek origin. It is very interesting to see that *aska* and ἀσκός match with Minoan *aka*.
* The 8th example, *mata(m)*, cannot be a loanword; the etymology of Greek μετά is unclear, so the 2 words either both have the same origin, or it is a (statistically rare) coincidence.
* The 9th example, *mutana*, is in my opinion one of the 'best' examples: it is not a loanword, it probably comes from the same root, and the 2 words have somewhat different meanings which are connected (which often happens with cognates).
* *tamna*, 'horse', is in my opinion another good example: it is probably not a loanword, it probably comes from the same root, and the 2 words have different - but related - meanings.
* *thap*, 'to consume', might be another good example: it is not a loanword, it probably comes from the same root, and the 2 words have different - but related - meanings. The only doubt here is whether the root is Indo-European or Pre-Greek: some etymologists say that δάπτω is IE, while others say it has a Pre-Greek origin, especially if it should be related to δεῖπνον (deîpnon, “meal”)
* The same goes for *themiasa*: probably not a loanword, may come from the same root, different but related meanings; some etymologists say θέμις is Pre-Greek, others say it is IE.
* *truna* and *turan* might be great examples: they are probably not loanwords, they probably come from the same root, the words have different but related meanings, and there is also a correspondence with (Pre-)Greek τύραννος: it may mean both 'ruler' and 'lady'. (A possible, but not necessarily relevant, observation: Pre-IE Europe/Balkans has been hypothesized to be a more women-centric society than the following IE societies; perhaps 'lady/princess' and 'ruler' weren't 2 terms as unrelated as they became in the following centuries).
* The 14th example, *arac*, may point to either ἱέραξ 'eagle' (but this word is more probably IE than Pre-Greek) or οὖραξ (the /o/ in Greek words from Pre-Greek was originally an /a/, and *-ουρ-* was originally /arʷ/ in Pre-Greek, so: *οὖραξ* &lt; \*arwak-)
* The 15th example, *eitua*, has also variants with *a-*; compare *aitua - aidoia* (P.G. form would be *aiduja*)
* The 16th example, *elaiwana*, seems a basic term that would difficultly be a loanword from Greek. Other IE languages had the same root, such as Old Armenian *ewł* 'oil', which points to (I cite) 'a borrowing from a Mediterranean Pre-Greek source'. Also compare ἐλαία from earlier *elaíwā*, 'olive'.
* The 17th example, *leth-*, also seems a term which would difficultly be a loanword from Greek, both because it is not identical/very similar to the Greek form (differently from other direct loanwords) and because of its meaning (most loanwords refer to physical/real things, not to abstract concepts).
* The 18th example, *littera*, is either a loanword from Greek, or it is a cognate with Pre-Greek. In both cases, the word is of Pre-Greek origin. I personally think it is a cognate rather than a loanword, because it shows the 'D/L' alternation, a distinct feature of Pre-Greek words which often gives forms which vary between D and L (example: Ὀδυσσεύς / Οὐλιξεύς -- Odysseus/Oulikseus); Beekes explains this variation as possibly pointing to /tɬ/ in Pre-Greek (e.g. *Utlukjeu*). If it is a cognate, the meaning couldn't originally be 'leather as writing material', but simply 'piece of leather', like it was originally in Greek too.
* The 19th example *maluwe* is, like the previous word, either a loanword from greek or a cognate with Pre-Greek. The word is of Pre-Greek origin, and Beekes reconstructs it as \*malwak-.
* The 20th example, *netsus*, might be a loanword, but the fact that it doesn't have the same meaning as the Greek word, but rather a related meaning, means it may be a cognate instead.
* The 21st example, *pulunza*, might be a loanword, but the fact that it doesn't have the same meaning as the Greek word, but rather a related meaning, means it may have the same origin.
* The same goes for the 22nd example, *sime*.
* The Greek form of *arim*, 'monkey', is a rare word, mentioned by [Hesychius of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesychius_of_Alexandria).
* The Greek word ἄπα, 'father', wasn't common either, but it [is](https://lsj.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%84%CF%80%CE%B1) recorded
* The 25th example, *cera*, might be loanwords from Greek, but the words come from the Pre-Greek substrate. Latin *cera* was taken from Etruscan, not Greek, so perhaps it has a substrate origin in both Greek and Etruscan, rather than being a loanword.
* The 26th example, *lithra*, is undisputedly considered of (pre-IE) Mediterranean substrate origin; the question is whether the Etruscan word comes from Greek/Latin, or from Pre-Greek (as a cognate).
* The 27th example, *morma*, might be a loanword.
* *tupi* and τυπή are probably cognates, but we don't know if they come from PIE or from Pre-Greek.
* *tur* and θύος are probably cognates, but we don't know if they come from PIE or from Pre-Greek.
* *tul* and *calanice* are weak examples; I included *tul* because of the related meaning (Etr. 'border', Gr. an island at the border of the world), and because the origin of Gr. Θούλη is unexplained (and in these cases the origin is likely to be Pre-Greek)
* κάμπτρα/κάμψα/κάψα are of Pre-Greek origin, so *capra* is either a cognate or a loanword.
* *apu/afu* points more to a cognate with ἅπτω than a loanword because of the variation in meaning.
* The last example is definitely a much 'weaker' link, which I decided to include because the 'Etruscan version' (= the version of the word if adapted to Etruscan phonology) of Gortun is, in fact, Curtun (there was no /g/ in Etruscan, so it would become /k/; there was no /o/ in Etruscan either, and it became /u/, eg. *Ruma* for Roma). It may be relevant if the 'migration theory' was correct.

Another possible common feature is the genitive/ablative of origin suffix:

* ***-akh*** in Etruscan (or ***-akj*** if it was palatalized, see paragraph on palatalization later)
* **-ak-** in Pre-Greek: many Pre-Greek words end in -akos, -akē, -aks, etc. which is **-ak-** when you remove the nominative ending; καυν**άκ**η, θῡλ**άκ**η, πιστ**άκ**η, φάρμ**ακ**ον, βατι**άκ**η...

We mustn't forget something: **we only know a few hundred Etruscan words, some of them even being IE-loanwords, and around 1000 Pre-Greek words. Not only do we have a relatively small word list, which makes it harder to find possible cognates; for many of these words (the vast majority of them) we only have the form in one of the 2 languages, not both.** For example, we know that 'daughter' was sec in Etruscan, but we don't know the Pre-Greek word for 'daughter'.

**PHONOLOGY**

Here are the phonetic inventories of the 2 languages:

||ETRUSCAN|PRE-GREEK|
|:-|:-|:-|
|STOPS|p pʰ   t̪ t̪ʰ   k kʰ|p pʲ pʷ ᵐp   t̪ t̪ʲ t̪ʷ ⁿt̪   k kʲ kʷ ᵑk|
|NASALS|m   n̪|m mʲ mʷ   n̪ n̪ʲ n̪ʷ|
|AFFRICATES|t̪͡s̪   ( ʧ )|(tɬ)|
|FRICATIVES|ɸ   s̪   ʃ   (xʷ)   h|(ɸ)   s̪ s̪ʲ s̪ʷ|
|APPROXIMANTS|j   w|j   w|
|LIQUIDS|l̪   r̪|l̪ l̪ʲ l̪ʷ   r̪ r̪ʲ r̪ʷ|
|VOWELS|ɑ  e  i  u|a  (e)  i  (o)  u|

\[My source for the Pre-Greek phonology is [Robert Beekes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_S._P._Beekes)' *Pre-Greek Phonology, Morphology, Lexicon*.\]

Note: the consonants in brackets, ʧ, xʷ, and tɬ, have been proposed but are either not accepted by the majority of experts (ʧ , xʷ) or only hypothesized briefly (tɬ)./ɸ/ is the only phoneme which included in the table which wasn't included in Beekes' work - it is my personal take on the alternation between /w/ , /m/ , and labial stops in certain Pre-Greek words (my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt though, since I am not a linguist). The Pre-Greek /e/ and /o/ are found in brackets because they were an allophone of /a/ when adjacent to palatalized consonants and labialized consonants, respectively. Beekes also wrote that probably not *all* of the labial/palatal versions of the consonants he lists were found in pre-Greek, since some of them are very rare in the world's languages.

The most obvious difference between the 2 inventories is, rather than the actual 'plain' phones (which are almost identical), that Etruscan has aspirated stops, while Pre-Greek has palatalized and labialized versions of both stops and resonant. This doesn't really have much importance in determining whether these 2 languages are related or not (take for example the IE family, which has languages with palatalized/labialized/aspirated consonants, and others with none of these variations), but it is worth mentioning that - according to some linguists specialized in Etruscan such as Helmut Rix and Mauro Cristofani - the language included /lʲ, rʲ, nʲ/, and the aspirated stops \[pʰ t̪ʰ kʰ\] were actually palatalized stops \[pʲ t̪ʲ kʲ\]. If this is true, it would make the languages more similar (although as I mentioned before these features aren't really useful to determine a possible relation between the two).

Some possible evidence for the theory about palatalized consonants:

* variant spellings such as amφare/amφiare, larθal/larθial, aranθ/aranθiia
* the city of Velχ was *Vulci in* Latin; \[wəlkʲ\] &gt; \[wulki\] seems more likely to me than \[wəlkʰ\] &gt; \[wulki\]

Another important similarity is that both languages don't have voiced-voiceless distinction.

**TO SUM UP**

* Genetic evidence points to an autochthonous or Central European origin of the Etruscans
* Archeological evidence also points to an autochthonous origin
* Etruscans had Indo-European genes, but they spoke a non-Indo-European language
* This language has some resemblance to the Pre-Greek, non-IE, language spoken in Greece (and possibly other areas such as the southern Balkans and/or Western Anatolia) during the Neolithic
* Some common (and non-loanword) lexicon
* A similar phonology
* Common suffixes not found in Indo-European, but often found in Etruscan and Pre-Greek (!)

**The question is: if the Etruscans were autochthonous to Central Europe (and then Italy), but they did, in fact, speak a language related to that spoken in the Aegean, how did this language arrive in Italy?**

My personal theory: the Neolithic population of Central Italy, which inhabited the region previous to the arrival of Indo-Europeans, Proto-Italics in this case (second half of the 2nd Millenium BC), had arrived in Italy during the Neolithic migrations (like the Neolithic inhabitants of Greece) and spoke a language related to Pre-Greek. The part about migrations is not my theory, it is [considered a fact (Cardium pottery migrations)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardium_pottery), while the part about the language is a 'logical' conclusion. When the Indo-Europeans arrived in Central Italy, some of them mixed with the Neolithic inhabitants of the region, and the Pre-IE language was maintained. This would be a similar situation to that which happened with the Basque, where the Pre-IE language was kept too, despite mixing with Indo-Europeans. Etruscan also contains many words of Indo-European etymology (even putting loanwords from Latin and Greek aside, words like *lautun*, 'people' &lt; PIE *hlewdʰ-*, 'people'), which may be explained if we assume that many words used by the immigrating IE speakers entered the Etruscan language when the pre-IE and IE peoples mixed. Alternatively, we know that the Villanovan culture originated from central European [Urnfield culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urnfield_culture) system; the latter is considered to be an IE-speaking culture, but nothing excludes that it may have included some pre-IE speakers from the Balkans. These speakers settled in Central Italy, then becoming the Etruscans.

Of course, **we don't know enough about Etruscan and Pre-Greek to** ***establish*** **if they are related or not,** all we can do is have theories.

linguistics,Eradicating English's last traces of grammatical gender through activist style guides,"Hello /r/linguistics. Recently I have read a lot about the history of ""they"" as a pronoun, and how it has been used since the 14th century to refer to people of known or unknown gender.

What sparked my interest specifically was the history of how grammarians treated the use of pronouns. Up until very recently, most style guides have completely rejected singular they, favouring a ""generic he"" or sentence re-formulation. Today the tables have turned. As women entered the workforce and an ideological shift toward gender equality occured, the field of linguistics underwent a change too. Grammarians became activists instead of historians, and suddenly the use of ""he"" to refer to someone who is not immediately obvious to be male was considered wrong. The same has happened to the terms spokesman, layman, and everyman, three terms which are wrong according.

While English has completely lost its grammatical gender and gendered inflections, many ""agent nouns"" retained their previous pronoun usage. ""Person"" is one of these. I have been corrected several times on my English essays for my use of ""generic he"", where a ""they"" is considered the correct alternative by ideologically motivated style guides. This despite ""he"" being what I would say or write naturally. Why is that? Enter a time machine and ask all my distant ancestors why they were not consistent with agent nouns. 

I feel pretty safe in claiming that the average English speaker uses a mixture of singular they and generic he in their language. I cannot speak for everyone, but I often use ""they"" when referring to an undetermined person, and ""he"" when referring to a specific person. Compare ""ask someone if they'd like a cookie"" to ""he's low HP, kill him"".

Generic he is part of my (and many others') natural spoken/written language, and hilarity ensues when I see people on the self-proclaimed online descriptivist flagship doing a conscious effort to alter their language to make it more ""correct"" or rather ""progressive"". The use of words like ""spokesperson"" and ""humankind"" have a very recent history, in fact almost correlating with the activist push for degenderization.

&amp;#x200B;

 It is very apparent that there Frankenstein words have had their etymologies be engineered, not spring from the spoken language. Singular they is obviously not something a blue-haired bespectacled feminist came up with, but precribed use of it is ridiculous. I was stunned when I was *corrected* for referring a redditor of unknown gender as ""he"" HERE. CORRECTED!

Why is singular they considered by so many to be ""incorrect"", despite it being part of so many people's natural language? In my view, ""they"" and ""he"" are in many cases practically synonyms, and consistent use of one of them should not be prescribed, as practically no one chooses one consistently in their natural language.",1622216213,infractionhook,5

linguistics,Looking for literature on mismatch between attitude and production,"Hello fellow linguists! I'm looking for references, either theoretical or empirical, on the mismatch between attitude and production (what speakers say they do, versus what they actually do.) 

For example, when asked, participants *say* that they use a particular form in everyday speech, and that the use of this form is important to them because it is prescriptively correct, but in their recorded speech, said form is nowhere to be found. 

I'm looking for either a theoretical approach that explores this mismatch, particularly in relation to prescriptive norms, as well as studies that share this same finding. I've spent some time reading through Preston's Theory of Folk Language, but the focus there seems less on prescriptivism and more on regionalism, which is not necessarily relevant for my case. 

I know I've read papers on this, and it's well known in the field that speaker attitude and behavior often don't coincide, but I'm having trouble actually finding **citations** that explain this.

linguistics,"As an American, I have noticed that people in the UK have a completely different attitude towards the N word. What’s your opinion on the matter?","My experience in the US and Canada with the N word is radically different than with other peoples experiences of the word in other countries. The more I talk to UK citizens, the more I see that there is a completely different attitude towards the word. In my part of the world, the N word is casually used in general conversations among so many different types of people. Over here, people see the word in less negative light than our UK counterparts. People over here differentiate between the word that ends in A and the one that ends in ER. Like the Spanish word from which it originates, people see that different variations can take on different meanings. I think that people in the US started to use the word in a way that stripped power from its previous meaning. This of course is not universal amongst all Americans. However, younger generations have reinvented the word and use it more liberally. Where I’m from, it doesn’t matter what race you are. Everyone uses the word with each other without second thought. Like I said though, this isn’t necessarily the norm with everyone but more-so younger people. That’s not to say that it is exclusively a generational thing though. 

When I talk to people in the UK though, I’d be hard pressed to find individuals that share the same mentality and sentiment towards the word. Over there it takes on a more negative connotation where people associate the word with racism and slave ownership. They use the word thats ends in A interchangeably with the one that ends in ER. I even read an article once where someone had the misconception that people use the word that ends in ER as a word meaning friend. The general attitude, thats I’ve encountered, over in the UK is that it is racist and only blacks can use it. Obviously this is all anecdotal. Seeing how this is a big world with a lot of people, I was curious as to what others experiences are with this word. What’s your opinion on the N word?",1621976505,JohnDoeIsMoe,6

linguistics,Latin or Greek?,"Hello,

Where I live has a lot of ancient sites and ruins and I get to visit them and old towns at certain times of the year. 

The thing is that the places have both Latin and Ancient Greek names. I would like to learn one of these languages in order to explore more about the history of my ancient country. By Greek I mean probably medieval Greek since ancient Greek would be too hard and I don't plan to learn Greek as a tool for communication in the near future. Another reason I'd like to learn one of these languages is that it would be cool to learn them and It would make me more cultured. Also the submersion and the thought of these languages used to be spoken on these lands thousands of years ago, and now again is pretty excitting to me..

linguistics,"I have a question about the use of gender-neutral pronouns ""they/their/them"" when referring to non-binary people in English","English isn't my first language and in my native tongue Portuguese we don't have normative gender-neutral pronouns widely used by people in normative and/or informal discourse when referring to non-binary people.

Most of the texts written in Portuguese use either masculine or feminine  pronouns in its argumentative structure and when referring to  people/objects/animals, where some linguistic rules applied to the termination of the words are taken by the speakers when they define a given word as masculine or feminine.

That is, the speakers define the word's gender and not the person's. Even so, it is common to people extend the understanding of the word's gender to the person's gender too. This is why a lot of people are pushing  political agendas in order to create gender-neutral pronouns in a romance and very gendered language like Portuguese -- which I believe  it's also happening in other romance languages too.

On the other hand, we actually have some gender-neutral words in Portuguese, like *presidente*, which means *president* in English. Despite that, many Brazilian presidents were male and when people usually hear such a word, they understand not only the word but  also the person associated to it as male.

In  English, I believe, when native speakers hear a word like ""secretary"" they can't define the gender. The equivalent, in Portuguese, would be *secretári****a*** to a female secretary and *secretári****o*** to a male secretary, with *secretári****os*** referring to the plural of both male and female secretaries, and *secretári****as*** only indicating female secretaries.

Although I have read a lot of English textbooks on several subjects since I  started studying the language, I've been exposed to gender-neutral pronouns applied to non-binary people only recently after Demi Lovato has announced *their* non-binary identity.

After their Wikipedia page was updated with the new pronouns, I noticed that I have never seen that sort of English language structure in any other  texts I've read before, i.e., the person who updated the new pronouns seemed to avoid using ""they/them"" when referring to *Demi Lovato* and used, several times, only the name *Lovato* repeatedly to talk about *them*.  It's different when we look at other people's Wikipedia biographies who don't identify as non-binary and we can observe the use of pronouns  ""she/her/her"" or ""he/his/him"" alongside with the person's name instead of only her name written a bunch of times.

Does the kind of linguistic structure used in [Lovato's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Lovato)  are usual or unusual in English normative writing and/or everyday conversation among native speakers when referring to non-binary people?  If I write an essay talking about a non-binary person or a person who I  don't know the gender and apply that kind of structure, would it be correct in normative English?

In a  text structure like the following, how does a native speaker  distinguish if I'm referring to a group of people or to a single non-binary person?

""Jennifer is non-binary and uses the pronouns they/their/them. Jennifer and their friends went to the Shopping Mall yesterday to buy some stuff. *They* had a lot of fun.""

Does a native speaker understand that I'm referring to Jennifer and their friends and not Jennifer alone? Or should I have substituted ***They had a lot of fun*** for ***Jennifer and their friends had a lot of fun*** like in Lovato's Wikipedia text structure?

Or, if I want to refer to both Jennifer and their friends, could I put ***They and their friends had a lot of fun***, using ***They*** **referring to** ***Jennifer alone*** and ***Their friends*** ***to Jennifer's friends***? Would it be confusing to a native speaker?

If I have let the structure *They had a lot of fun*, would it be ambiguous? If I have used the structure found in Lovato's  Wikipedia Page, wouldn't it be redundant to repeat their name several times and not using different equivalent pronouns to their non-binary identity, giving a more even reading?

I'm sorry if you didn't understand what I was talking about. It's my third year studying English and I don't know how to properly formulate my reasoning yet. I know this is a delicate subject and I don't intend to offend anyone. I'm just worried about how this kind of structure can be confusing in a more complex text talking about non-binary people and  would like to know if there is a more efficient approach that could be taken.",1621967260,OwlFawkes,4

linguistics,Wondering if this is possible at all,"I came up with something called a ""character grid"", and I was wondering if it could work.

Essentially, you have a small square grid box, like a tic tac toe grid. In each of the squares would be a single character, and they were arranged in such a way that no matter how you read the grid (L to R, U to D, R to L, etc.), you could read something coherent, whether it was a word or a full sentence. For example:

|T|I|M|
|:-|:-|:-|
|E|I|S|
|N|O|W|

L to R, U to D, it would be TIMEISNOW (time is now)  
R to L, U to D (like Hebrew), it would be MITSIEWON (Mitsie won)  
U to D, R to L (like lit. Chinese), it would be MSWIIOTEN (Ms. Wii O' Ten...?)  
And so on with other ways of reading scripts (U to D, L to R, etc.)  


This example I gave doesn't exactly work as shown with that last example, so I was wondering if something like this is possible, where no matter how you read it you could read something coherent.  I imagine with languages like Chinese, you could get a full sentence out of. Japanese is another possible candidate using just kana.",1621896750,Reletr,5
linguistics,Is Russian considered to have four-way consonant distinction?,"Russian loves to distinguish palatalization. For example, нос is unpalatalized (hard) and means ""nose,"" while нёс is palatalized (soft) and means ""carried."" AFAIK, soft consonants are considered separate consonants to hard ones, even though the orthography uses vowel letters to distinguish (makes sense, we don't need 40 different consonant letters).

Does this, along with a voicing distinction, qualify Russian as a language with a four-way consonant distinction?

I am not talking about the already well defined ones such as the “un-in” merger into “æ̃” (in parisian french), but the currently ongoing changes. 

Here are the changes that I have noticed as a native Parisian french speaker (who lives in Paris) :

- full closing of the nasal vowel “ɔ̃” (already pronounced “õ”) to a nasal syllabic consonant “ɴ̩ʷ”
in very fast speed it can affect the following voiced plosive making it a syllabic consonant as well: “tombe” —&gt; “t̪ɴ̩ʷb”~“t̪ɴ̩ʷm”~”t̪m̩”

- beginning of a “ə-ɔ“ merger into “ɵ~ɔ” 
e.g. difficulties distinguishing “saurai” and “serai” 
“re-“ prefix realised as “ʁɔ” (“rocommencer”)

- weakening of “v” into “ɦ” or “ʕ” :
“voilà” “ɦʷala” ; “ça va” “saɦa”

unsurprising unstable R sound :

- “ɡʁ” and “kχ” can be realised as affricates, respectively “ɢ͡ʁ” and “q͡χ”

- depending on its position in the word, the R sound can be pronounced in various different ways, from “ɰ” and as far as a “ʢ”, all being allophones.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

These types of questions are subject to removal:

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.

* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",1621854014,AutoModerator,172
linguistics,"In some languages, like Nepali, and besides that where I have observed it i.e., Japanese and Korean, there are onomatopoeic words that have nothing to do with sound at all because the phenomenon does not have any sound; is this present in other languages and can they be classified as onomatopoeia?","By general definition, onomatopoeia concerns the mimicking of sounds in nature by human languages. They have a coherent but diverse variation across the world's languages and a lot of vocabulary is even derived from them.

However, in Nepali, and besides that, Japanese and Korean, where I have observed this happen, there are quite a number of onomatopoeic words that describe things that do not produce any sound at all. In these cases, it mostly concerns emphasis on the phenomenon rather than mimicking any sound at all.

In Nepali, both the sound producing onomatopoeia and the ones that do not concern any sound are classified as **अनुकरणात्मक शब्द** (literally, ""imitative word"") in grammar.

Some Nepali examples are:

स्याउको बोटमा फलहरु **लटरम्म** फलेका छन्। = ""There are plenty of fruits in the apple tree.""

 transliteration = Syāuko boṭmā phalharu **laṭaramma** phalekā chan. 

Syau-ko = apple-genitive suffix; bot-ma = plant/tree-locative suffix; phal-haru = fruit-plural (fruits); **lataramma** = onomatopoeia (concerns plentiful production of fruits), phaleka chan = present perfective of phalnu, ""to ripen, to be produced(of fruits)""

literally = ""The apple tree has produced fruits **lataramma**.""

&amp;#x200B;

म त पानीले **निथ्रुक्क** भिजें।  = ""I am completely drenched/soaked in the rain.""

 transliteration = Ma ta pānīle **nithrukka** bhijen. 

Ma = first person singular(I), ta = emphasis particle; pani-le = water/rain-instrumental suffix; **nithrukka** = onomatopoeia (concerns being absolutely drenched by water), bhijen = simple past of bhijnu, ""to be wet""

literally : ""I am drenched by rain **nithrukka**.""

&amp;#x200B;

आकाशमा **टहटह** जुन लागेको छ। = ""The moon shines in the sky.""

 transliteration = Ākāśmā **ṭahaṭaha** jun lāgeko cha. 

Akash-ma = sky-locative suffix; **tahataha** = onomatopoeia; jun = moon; lageko cha = present perfective of lagnu, (means many things, compound verb here of  ""jun lagnu"" = ""to shine (of moon), like gham lagnu = to shine (of sun)

literally: ""The moon shines in the sky **tahataha**.""

&amp;#x200B;

मैले उसलाई देखेर **मुसुक्क** हासें। = ""I saw him and smiled.""

 transliteration : Mailē uslāī dekhera **musukka** hāse.  

Ma-le (maile) = I-nominative suffix; u-lai (uslai) = him-accusative suffix; (Nepali has split ergativity so my naming of the suffix can be wrong so these two basically show the subject and object in the sentence); dekhera = form of dekhnu, ""to see""; **musukka** = onomatopoeia (concerns the activity of smiling) ; hase = simple past of ""hasnu"" to smile

literally : ""I saw him and smiled **musukka**.""

&amp;#x200B;

There are manyyyyy other such words. A non exhaustive list with some examples are:

Such as **टुलुटुलु** tulutulu(concerns watching in an amused manner),

**प्याच्च** pyachcha(concerns abruptly speaking something),

 **किरिङ्गमिरिङ्ग** kiringmiring (concerns untidy or unintelligible writing or scribbles),

 **धुरुधुरु** dhurudhuru (concerns intense crying), 

**झिलिमिली** jhilimili (concerns repeated flashing of lights), 

**ह्वारह्वार** hwarhwar (concerns raging fire),

  **डम्म** damma (of overcast clouds), 

**टपक्क** tapakka (of picking up something),

 **खिस्रिक्क** khisrikka (concerns slight sound or movement) , 

**मिलिक्क** milikka (concerns flashing of light, usually lightning), 

**फनन** fanana (concerns spinning), 

**झमक्क** jhamakka (concerns getting dark) and so on.

As we can see, in all the sentences and these examples, the onomatopoeia mainly seems to describe the event in a certain, vivid manner so they tend to work as adverbs. The only difference is adverbs are mostly universal in their usage and they can be used with any verbs. (walk slowly, write slowly, speak slowly, swim slowly, fly slowly etc.) these ""onomatopoeia"" have very specific usage that are only relevant and ""correct"" in the appropriate scenario. 

There are also sound producing, generally understood onomatopoeia in the same category. Such as:

बादलले **गड्याङ्गगुडुङ्ग** गर्दै छ; अब छिट्टै पानी पर्नेछ। = ""The clouds are rumbling; it will rain soon.""

 transliteration = Bādal-lē **gaḍyāṅgguḍuṅg** gardai cha; aba chiṭṭai pānī parnēcha. 

badal-le = cloud-subject; **gadyangudung** = onomatopoeia (concerns rumbling of clouds, thunder); gardai chha (simple imperfective of garnu, ""to do""); aba = now; chhittai = soon, pani = rain; parnechha = simple future of ""parnu"", (means many things, compound verb here as ""pani parnu"" = ""to rain"")

literally = ""The clouds are doing **gadyangudung**; now it will rain soon.""

&amp;#x200B;

धारामा पानी **तपतप** गर्दैछ।  = ""The water is dripping in the tap.""

 transliteration = Dhārāmā pānī **taptap** gardaicha. 

dhara-ma = tap-at; pani = water, **taptap** = onomatopoeia (concerns dripping of liquid), gardaichha = present imperfective of garnu, ""to do"")

literally : ""The water in the tap is doing **taptap**.

Both of these concern events that do produce sound. This phenomenon of words describing events that do not have any sound or mostly concern the way something is also occurs in Japanese and Korean. Thus, my question is, do these types of words have a specific category and do they occur in other languages besides the one explained here?

IANALinguist but I often need to translate texts from Chinese to English/French for others to read.

Of course, as a translator, I should be the one to translate the metaphors so that there is no ambiguity, but there are some cases where I need to keep the Chinese wording.

The Routledge Handbook of Chinese Linguistics has a chapter on metaphors but I'd like to find some research that compares how Chinese people see some concepts vs how we see them: a classic example I can think of is the word ""dog"", which is much more negative in Chinese than in English, and ""blood"", which in my understanding is more positive and less gory in Chinese people's imagination than in our western imagination.

linguistics,Experiment: Does writing a closely related language in your native phonemic spelling improve intelligibility?,"I just had somewhat of a shower thought: if a relatively closely related language (same language family, large amount of cognates) was written using your native language, would this improve or decrease the amount of intelligibility? 

For example, if one were to write German using Dutch phonemic spelling, would it then be easier for Dutchmen to understand the German language?

|German (translation of the above sentence) written using Dutch phonetic spelling:|
|:-|
|*Wenn man Deutsch mit der niederländischen phonemischen Rechtschreibung schreiben würde, wäre es dann einfacher für Niederländer um die deutsche Sprache zu verstehen?* |
|*Wen man Doitsj miet deem niederlendisjen fonemiesjen rechtsjrijboenk sjrijben wurde, were es dan einfacher fuur Niederlender oem die doitsje sjpraache tsoe versteeën?*  |

or vice versa; if Dutch would be spelled in the German manner, would it be easier to understand for German speakers?

|Dutch (translation of the above sentence) written using German phonetic spelling:|
|:-|
|Wanneer Nederlands op de Duitse manier gespeld zou worden, zou het dan voor Duitstaligen beter te begrijpen zijn? |
|*Wannehr Nederlanz ob de Dauze mannier chespellt sau worden, sau het dann fohr Dauztahlige behter te begreipen sein?*   |

The thing is though, that I'm not entirely sure about the answer to my question ... it's kind of tricky. 

In the above example I didn't see any increase in intelligibility when using the alternative spelling at first. In fact, I thought it might have decreased. Certain words (like German um vs Dutch om) certainly seemed easier to recognize using regular spelling, but the longer I look at these sentences ... I don't know, after some acclimatizing I'm starting to think the ""Dutchified"" spelling of the German sentence actually might just be easier to understand. 

I'm fairly fluent in German, but I'm not a native so it's somewhat more difficult to judge the Germanized Dutch sentence, but I it's starting to grow on me as well. Maybe some native speakers could add their two cents on this. 

I think similar examples could be made (please feel free to do so) for other languages, say for Italian/French, Polish/Croatian, Finnish/Estonian, etc. I'm quite interested in how different examples would work out in regard to intelligibility.",1621803170,Paixdieu,15

Phoneme 1: it is always pronounced [i], no matter the context. We can definitely analyze it as a /i/ phoneme.

Phoneme 2: if followed by a /ŋ/, it is realized as a [ʊ]. In every other case, including when in isolation, it is pronounced [u], therefore it makes perfect sense to analyze the phoneme as /u/.

Phoneme 3: it is always pronounced [y], so it doesn't create any issues. The phoneme can be analyzed as /y/.

Phoneme 4: it is pronounced [ɛ] when followed by /n/ and [ɑ] when followed by /u/ or /ŋ/. However, in any other context (including when in isolation), it is realized as [a], so it's perfectly fine to analyze the phoneme as /a/.



Now onto phoneme 5, which has not two, not three, but *four* distinct realizations:

[e] when followed by /i/, or when preceded by /j/ or /ɥ/ if there is no coda

[o] when followed by /u/, or when preceded by /w/ if there is no coda

[ə] **when followed by a nasal**

[ɤ] **when not followed by a coda or preceded by a glide, and most importantly, when in isolation**



So as we can see, the schwa is not only one of many realizations of its phoneme, but it's the one that occurs in the least amount of environments. Why is it not analyzed as a /ɤ/ rather than a /ə/, since it's literally the way native speakers pronounce it in isolation and [ə] is such a specific realization that exclusively occurs before a nasal?",1621799961,Lapov,36
linguistics,Is it common for the presence of phonemic vowel length distinctions to be hugely variable across dialects?,"I'm most familiar with English, which has a lot of variation in whether particular dialects have phonemic length distinctions. Middle English is likely to have had distinctions that were largely length-based, which have disappeared in all(?) modern dialects as a result of the Great Vowel Shift. A lot of modern dialects (like most of AmEng and West Country English) do not have any phonemic vowel distinctions that are purely length-based, whereas non-rhotic dialects (like standard southeastern British English and dialects across Oceania) have re-developed phonemic length distinctions along different lines.

I'm not that intimately familiar with any other language, but I've never heard of a dialect of Spanish (for example) that makes length distinctions, even though there are loads of dialects around the world. This might just be due to my inexperience with the language. 

Is the volatility of length distinctions just a coincidence in English? Is it a result of there being lots of relatively unconnected dialects? Is it because English dialects have large vowel inventories?",1621795855,Skipquernstone,26

linguistics,How do Bantu languages (Shona in particular) work?,"When I learn a language, I like to not only speak and study individual pieces of grammar but try to get some basic intuition for how the language works on a higher level.

Eg as an English speaker learning Spanish, if your mindset is to constantly convert English to Spanish in your head, you will progress slower and your Spanish will be unidiomatic. To truly understand how Spanish works, it's critical to realize that, compared to English, in Spanish there is a much stronger reliance on verbs being conjugated to contain information that has to be communicated through other means in English. There's also word classes (el and la) which verbs and adjectives have to agree with.

Reading about Bantu languages, there's a lot of talk about how they have lots of word classes, eg Shona having 21 mupanda. But do eg verbs and adjectives have to be conjugated to agree with the mupanda? Eg in Spanish el chico lindo vs la chica linda

Or are the mupanda literally just categories of things that don't really affect the rest of the sentence eg in German der schöne Mann vs die schöne Frau (junge being a der word and frau being a die word not really affecting the rest of the sentence)

linguistics,"""Mystery"" and ""Mr. E"": What are some minimal pairs in English that legitimately only differ by stress placement?","Often times when people talk and teach about vowel stress, they use homographic noun vs. verb pairs like ""produce"", ""record"" and ""addict"", and although these do have different stress placements, they don’t really have the same vowels because the unstressed vowel gets reduced to a schwa in at least one of the words.

* ""produce"": noun = **/'prɑ dus/** ...|... verb = **/prə 'dus/**
* ""record"": noun = **/'rɛ kɚd/** ...|... verb = **/ rə 'kɔrd/**
* ""addict"": noun = **/'æ dɪkt/** ...|... verb = **/ə 'dɪkt/**

With the pair ""mystery"" and ""Mr. E"", they legitimately have the same three vowels and the only difference appears to be which vowel has primary stress.

* ""mystery"": **/'mɪ stɚ i/**
* ""Mr. E"": **/mɪ stɚ 'i/**

I am sure that all of these minimal pairs would be between a single word and a phrase, or two phrases, as I don't think there are two lone words in English that differ only by stress without vowel reduction.

linguistics,Question from a non-linguist: What is the linguist’s perspective on co-opting or cultural appropriation of language?,"I can understand a desire for use of some words to be limited to some groups, especially if those words have origins in oppression of that group. But, there seem to be a lot of folks discouraging use of words by privileged groups, even when those words have a somewhat neutral meaning and apply universally to most cultures, and don’t have a specific oppressive context. 

I’m curious about your perspectives in general, but I am also specifically interested in how this movement to pause cultural exchange in the use and evolution of language is viewed in the context of the science and history of language development. 

Some examples.

Tribe: Apparently has Roman origins and could be used to accurately describe groups of humans from every part of the world at different times in history, but is labeled as appropriation due to relatively recent use to describe Native American groups. 

Squad: Apparently has origins in the French military, and to my memory, has primarily been used in military contexts until adopted by hip hop culture in recent decades. And even then, usage in hip hop has often been specifically for the purpose of evoking military imagery. 

Picnic: Has origins in 17th century France, but internet rumor mills have described it as a shorthand phrase related to the lynching of African Americans. 


Some more questions: 

Is the movement against cultural appropriation of language viewed neutrally, as an interesting development?

Is it viewed as a ridiculously futile attempt to hold back the tide of the natural mechanisms of language development?

Is it a welcomed, or exciting, or a relief of some kind?

What are your opinions on inaccurate understanding of the origins of these words? Is it misguided, or does it matter less than more recent context? If the words are inflammatory today (even if they are only inflammatory because someone decided to label them so, and sometimes even create a false history to go with that label), is the long history of the word irrelevant to future usage?

Are there past examples of words that evaporated from common usage based on misinformation in the context of abrupt cultural shifts?

linguistics,There is something wierd I noticed about my language (Hebrew),"The English suffix (a)tion have a Hebrew equivalents which are ציה and אציה (pronounced tzia and atzia). For example, animation in Hebrew is אנימציה (animatzia). I didn't understand why is that way, and how the suffixes developed, but I would like to know why is it that way. When I asked about it, people told me that it came from Russian, but it doesn't make sense because there's also another Hebrew suffix equivalent.

What I'm referring to is the Hebrew versions of the suffix (I)ty which are ות and יות (pronounced ut and your). For example, in Hebrew homosexuality is הומוסקסואליות (homosexualiut, sorry if I wrote the pronunciation of it wrong). So why did I mentioned this? Well that's because there is no (y)ut suffix in Russian, although I have preety bad Russian so I might be wrong. 

I would like to know:

1. If both come from Russian how they did developed?

2. If one did came from Russian while the other didn't, why it came from Russian?

3. Did it even came from Russian?

4. There's lots of other suffixes prefixes and suffixes in English that I'm not sure if they have Hebrew equivalents (anti, pro, ment, fy, Ify, ry, ery, ary, ence, ance, de, re, en etc.), How can I know if there is?

5. There are ones who might have. For example, for the suffix ess there's a few female Hebrew suffixes such as ה (only one letter, Pronounced as a), ית (pronounced as it), but there's also other female Hebrew suffixes but for plural version such as ות (pronounced as ot) and יות (pronounced as iot).

6. From which languages came the Hebrew suffixes and prefixes? I'll give examples to be more precise, sorry that I won't write in the Hebrew but only it the English pronunciation, it just really long to write:

A. Adjective suffixes- e (male version of a, exists only as a suffix for male only when the female is a), I (another male version) a (female version), et (female version), at (female version, not sure if regular version though or if it's of verbs), im (plural male version), ot (plural female version)

B. Verb suffixes and prefixes- י, ה, ת, א, נו, ים, ות, נ, תם, תן, ו
 A lot of them used for more one one type (of verbs) and pronounced sometimes differently

C. Nouns suffixes- ה, ות, יות

C. Ownership and relation nouns suffixes- י, תי, נו, תנו,

linguistics,I had my Swedish friend ask me a question which I wasn’t sure how to answer: female reporter/women reporter,"She asked me about the clause “the female reporter” as opposed to “the woman reporter”. I said, ‘women’, being the plural of the noun ‘woman’ doesn’t describe the subject of the clause. The clause, “the women reporter” goes “[determiner] [noun] [noun]”; it doesn’t make sense. What you want to do is describe the subject, ‘the reporter’. Female acts as both a noun and an adjective, so you can accurately describe the subject by using female. “The female reporter”, “[determiner] [adjective] [noun]”. 

But I noticed many reputable publications using ‘woman/en’ in place of ‘female’. Such as ‘women judges’, or ‘women reporters.

linguistics,Etymological vs Phonological Orthography,"Which one do you think is better? They both have clear advantages and disadvantages.

This question popped up in my mind while dealing with the Spanish verb ""haber."" It's spelling used to be ""aver"", which is exactly how it's pronounced. But this was changed to ""haber"" to reflect the Latin verb ""habere"" which it originates from.

At first, I thought this was stupid, since I was tired of the orthography of English and Korean. Both languages' spelling rules are more etymological than phonological, causing confusion to learners and native speakers alike. (Some of you may say that Korean orthography is perfectly phonological. In reality, it's more like French's. While it's entirely possible to figure out pronunciation from spelling, the reverse is impossible because of complicated spelling rules.)

Then I thought, without etymological spelling, it would be difficult to tell that ""he"" and ""ha"" are just different inflected forms of ""haber.""

Based on the spelling reforms I've seen so far, linguists seem to prefer etymological spelling while the common folks absolutely hate it. I can't be sure since I'm not really an expert on this matter, which is why I'm asking you people what you think about it.",1621437909,LA95kr,28

linguistics,Arabicization of speech among devout Muslims,"I've noticed this particular trend among some Urdu speakers who are devout (Sunni) Muslims - they seem to adopt Arabic words, phrases and even Arabic pronunciation, in place of their colloquial Urdu equivalents, when it comes to Islam-specific topics. 

For example, they replace the more commonly-used words ""namāz"" (prayer) and ""khudā"" (God) with the Arabic loanwords ""salāh"" and ""Allāh"" respectively.

Arabic phrases like ""Allāhu ā'lam"" (God knows best) and ""Jazākallāh"" (May God reward you) are used rather than Urdu equivalents like ""Khudā bahtar jāntā hai"" (God knows best) and ""Shukriyā"" (Thanks). 

Some speakers may also try to emulate as close a pronunciation to the original Arabic as possible for specific Arabic words rather than a standard Urdu pronunciation: for example, ""Ramzān"" is rendered ""Ramadān"", ""Kurān"" is pronounced ""Qur'ān"" with a glottal stop after the /r/, and ""Hadīs"" (Hadith) is pronounced ""Hadīt"".

These final examples are particularly interesting- I mean, the glottal stop in Qur'an that's not even part of Standard Urdu phonology! Very bizarre and very intriguing!

linguistics,What responsibility do linguists have to help the communities they study?,"I work as a linguist among a Bantu people group in West Africa. A French linguist came here and studied their language and music. He paid them, bought them food, drink, etc. When he had gathered data he went back to France. He called from time to time while finishing his dissertation. Once it was done he visited again and even gave out a couple copies of his dissertation. He returned to France and never called again. People from here called him from time to time but after awhile he asked them to stop calling. Now it is the consensus here that he was really a spy and was no better than the colonizers of the past. 

Another (national) linguist basically did the same thing. She came to one of the villages, studied the language, paid people gave them gifts and food. But once she finished her dissertation she has never been back. 

The people here feel used. Like these people came acting like they were helping this undocumented language, but really they were just getting data for themselves.

linguistics,Aspirated consonants in Mandarin,"Hi everyone!

I've been doing some reading on Mandarin linguistics, and particularly phonetics, recently. I encountered some discrepancies when it comes to the description of certain consonants.

I stumbled upon the following discrepancies:

1) Some sources claim that e.g. q t͡ɕʰ \[a+\] and j t͡ɕ \[a-\] are prepalatal affricates, and not alveolo-palatal affricates. Is this just a difference in terminology?

2) p pʰ \[a+\] - b p \[a-\] : are they bilabial or labial?

3) c t͡sʰ \[a+\] - z t͡s \[a-\] : alveolar affricates or dental sibilants?

The latter solutions (labial, dental sibilants) were taken from Francis D. M. Dow's *An Outline of Mandarin Phonetics*. Is this book still relevant or would you suggest I look up these problems in a more recent book? What is the must-read work about Mandarin phonetics?

linguistics,Dialect Dissection: Indie Voice/Cursive Singing - Updated!,"Hey, everyone! I’m the writer of the original indie voice article. I’ve been posting here for months saying I have some big update in the works, and I am pleased that [this big update is finally ready](https://www.acelinguist.com/2021/05/dialect-dissection-indie-voicecursive.html). It’s a total rewrite, I’ve added new examples, and the theoretical understanding has changed as well.

Some important new findings:

* Documenting features of “indie voice” that hadn’t been described yet, such as lack of aspiration in fortis consonants (/p/, /t/, /k/), the /ɛ/ vowel lowering to \[æ\], and the common realization of words like ‘down’ with \[aʊ\] (and not \[æʊ\]).
* Finding IRL examples of “indie diphthongization.” There had been discussion about whether this feature could be found in person or was particular to sung speech. I found examples, as well as a source potentially describing this feature.
* Expanding the register-based analysis of indie voice, and introducing a concept from language contact
* Everyone's always telling me to include Billie Holiday, and she's finally here :)

I feel like there’s more I could add, and there’s still a lot of uncovered ground on this topic. “Indie voice” is significantly larger and more diverse than the singular name would imply. But I have already spent more than three years working on unraveling indie voice, so I would love to take a break and read other people’s work on indie voice in the future.

I hope you all get something from this updated version of the article, and if you have any questions, fire away! I love talking about the methodology, and I went through multiple potential analyses of the final result.

linguistics,"English sign of infinitive change when used with ""try""","Hope everyone is doing well.

I recently became aware of a structure in English (my native language) that changes the sign of the infinitive when used with the auxiliary verb ""try"". I'm a university student minoring in linguistics, so I have some formal training, but I've only done research in phonology and phonetics. I did an informal poll across other people at my college and found I was not alone in having this construction.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples:

""And"" sign - *I will try and go to the store.*

""To"" sign    - *I will try to go to the store.*

&amp;#x200B;

""And"" sign - *I have to try and stop him!*

""To"" sign    - *I have to try to stop him!*

&amp;#x200B;

Both of these have the same meaning to me, only differentiating in formality; the ""and"" construction being more informal. This is different when compared to simultaneous and consecutive verbs, along with method verbs (verbs that can follow ""in order"").

*I will drink (in order) to forget Linda.*

*I will drink and forget Linda.*

&amp;#x200B;

*I punched my brother to make him remember what he did.*

*I punched my brother and made him remember what he did.*

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few questions:

1. Does this feature have a name? I don't know what to search in order to find some research on this topic.
2. How common is this feature? What dialects of English permit the ""and"" sign to be used?
3. Can you use a different auxiliary verb other than ""try""? I could only think of examples for this case. Must it be an auxiliary verb?
4. Are there any other cases where the sign of the infinitive changes in English? I am only aware of its removal when tense is applied.
5. Are there examples in your native language where this occurs?

* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

linguistics,"In the Nepali language, there is an aspect that denotes events that happened in the past time but were only recently known/realized by the observer. Is there a standard term for this aspect/grammatical feature and does it exist in other languages?","Good afternoon everyone! 

I hope everyone is staying safe and well.

Nepali verbs inflect for an **अज्ञात भूत** (agyāt bhūt literally, ""unknown past"") aspect of the past tense. It denotes events that took place in the past at an unknown time but were only known by an observer recently (who does not know when the event took place). This is one of the 5 aspects of the past tense. (simple, imperfective(ongoing/incomplete), perfective(complete), habitual and ""unknown""). The present and future tenses only have simple, imperfective and perfective aspects.

Real life examples of the ""unknown past"" would be a person realizing that someone has slept or eaten something or fallen asleep or gone home, without their initial presence or knowledge of so event.

1. **जोन त सुतेछ। (literally :** ***""(I just realized) John has slept.""*****)**
2. **तिमीले खाना खाएछौ।  (literally :** ***""(I just realized) You have eaten/had dinner.""*****)**
3. **मार्क घर गएछ। (literally :** ***""(I just realized) Mark has gone home.""*****)**
4. **म त निदाएछु। (literally :** ***""(I just realized) I had\* fallen asleep.""*****)** (I have used had in this translation because one cannot realize that one had fallen asleep until after they have woken up, so.)

Even though I have used ***""I just realized""*** for the conveyance of the meaning, there are no words denoting ""I just realized"" in the sentences. A more comprehensive meaning would be ""I don't know when it happened but I just realized that Mark has gone home."" for the third example.

 It could very well be represented as ***""John has apparently slept.""*** or ***""You have apparently eaten/had dinner.""*** or ***""Mark has apparently gone home.""*** or ***""I had apparently fallen asleep.""*** because the sentence does not state any pronoun in case of who is observing it. I just didn't use ""apparently"" explicitly because it tends to bring in evidentiality when all the events actually did take place and the speaker knew directly and there is no explicit evidential distinction in any tenses.

The sentences only convey the part after ""I just realized"". The inflection of the verb implies that the event happened in the past and it is not known when that was and the observer only recently realized the happening of so event and does not know when it took place.

The event also need not be complete or ongoing. In the first case of John, when the speaker saw him, it implies that he is still asleep. In the second case, when the speaker knew it, ""you"" had completed eating dinner. While in Mark's case, when the speaker knew it, Mark had already gone home so he could either be on the way or have already reached home. In case of one realizing that they had fallen asleep, they had already woken up by the time so the action of sleeping was complete and they only didn't realize when they had fallen asleep.

This is different than the supposedly analogous example I have given with the present/past perfect because a perfective aspect of all three general tenses does exist distinctly in the Nepali language.

1. **मार्क घर गएको छ। (literally :** ***""Mark has gone home.""*****)** 
2. **तिमीले खाना खाएको छौ।  (literally :** ***""You have eaten/had dinner.""*****)**
3. **मार्क घर गएको थियो। (literally :** ***""Mark had gone home.""*****)**
4. **तिमीले खाना खाएको थियौ। (literally:** ***""You had eaten dinner.""*****)**

In these scenarios, the speaker knows that Mark went home in the present (first case) and in the past (second case). Or that ""you"" had eaten dinner in the present or the past in the latter two cases. These are part of the **पूर्ण भूत** (""complete"" past in sentence 1. and 2.) and **पूर्ण वर्तमान** (""complete"" present in sentence 3. and 4.) aspects because they denote that the action that took place had been completed when an observer knew it.

Contrary to this, in the second case of the first three sentences, the speaker does not know when Mark went home and only realized recently. They also did not know when ""you"" had eaten dinner. But both of those events happened in the past. So this form is used.

I am sorry if this rather confusing; I have relentlessly tried looking for an analogous name for this ""unknown"" aspect or grammatical feature but I have not found anything similar or relatable and thus thought I should ask here. I do not know if this is some bizarre kind of evidentiality or mood masquerading among aspects either so some help in understanding this would be thoroughly appreciated.

Thank you!",1621237382,Nish_thp,52

I'm trying to figure out the best groups to talk to and keywords to search for.

I'm looking to connect to people and figure out my role in life.


I'm a highly sensitive person (atypical). Being sensitive, I have a nuanced nervous system and senses. I am very detail oriented and I can spot and sense things others may not see. I'm sensitive in a lot of ways and this can help in a lot of fields.  I have a lot of gifts to offer the world. I'm also a dancer and movement feeler. I've healed myself of incredible things. 


I'm a highly sensitive person and also very sensitive to communication ( resonance frequencies ). I don't really use my voice as it's very subtle and sensitive. Especially talking to people or listening to people, I am sensitive to their communication. And I will get sick frequently in my body if their communication frequency is dissonant to mine. My health is very effected by this concept. I don't know how to be in the world, people get very upset and don't understand that I don't use my voice. I'm like a mime but I haven't figured out how to navigate society and/or finding my voice and direction and place in life.

I traveled last year before the pandemic then stayed  in the country I traveled to for the pandemic. Currently I'm stuck here in a foreign country and my best friend of 10 years and support contact from abroad has dropped support and doesn't want to be my friend anymore so I'm trying to figure out where to live, make money and navigate this totally alone which has always been difficult for me because I get confused easily. I'm definitely heartbroken because I thought we were a team. I came from a difficult family structure so having a friend was amazing. 

I'm studying a lot of quantum manifestation thinking so I can create a beautiful life. I'm contacting a lot of random people, therapists, expat groups, farms etc but it's like my message is getting blocked from the universe because it's hard to get in contact with anyone. I have faith, but I have to want to figure out what I want. 

 I'm an inventor type person.  I want to collaborate with others and build a healthy world. I like people who are down to earth, smart, reasonable, open minded. I appreciate everyone though lol. I like unusual ideas and being able to explore those with people who take it seriously though. Who like nature, food, homes, building society, urban design, community design, global health, people who like to play and build crazy inventions to play on like trampolines and play equipment, primitive building, climbing trees. Inventors and practical openminded caring people who like to plan. I also like talking to kind, caring, gentle people who value humanity but also value each individual. Caring about people.

Why? It makes more sense to write it with the apostrophe. We don't write ""the cats bowl"", we write ""the cat's bowl"". So why can't ""its bowl"" be written as ""it's bowl""?

And before you say ""*it's* is a contraction of *it is*"", just that a spelling is used for one thing doesn't mean it can't be used for another. In the phrases ""the cat's sleeping"", ""the cat's been sleeping"", and ""the cat's bowl"", ""cat's"" means the contraction for ""cat is"" in the first, ""cat has"" in the second, and ""of the cat"" in the third. The same punctuation is used for three different things. Nobody complains, because the context makes it unambiguous what it means.

In fact, historically, ""it's"" was what everybody used, and thus is was considered correct. Then ""its"" became more common, and people for some reason decided that ""it's"" should be incorrect. Yet people constantly use it that way. Apparently it's okay that people changed the punctuation back then, but they're not allowed to change it now?

linguistics,Please explain descriptivism to a non-linguist,"I came upon the terms ""descriptivism"" and ""descriptive linguistics"" for the first time today, but they seem to pertain to a question that has puzzled me for years:

What is the test of correct use of language? 

Today I came upon the phrase ""could care less"" which has always sounded ridiculous to my ears. Though I know this to be common in American English, I can conceive it as nothing but a bastardisation or miscomprehension of ""couldn't care less"". But when reading a Reddit discussion on the matter I found a self-described descriptivist (clunky, I know) declaring that whatever ""sounds right"" to Native speakers **is** right. 

This seems akin to the odious proposition that an idea is true if enough people believe it. I heard a similar argument made years ago, when ""literally"" got a new dictionary definition that was opposite to its original (and, in my view, true) meaning. More importantly, this vague definition begs these questions: 

How many native speakers must accept a usage case or definition before it is deemed correct?

Supposing such a threshold could be firmly defined, how would anyone determine when it had been met?

I appreciate the desire to democratise language and validate local dialects, but if the boundaries of correctness are forever expanded, surely everything becomes correct and ""correct"" ceases to be a meaningful designation.

I know my own arguments are not watertight (e.g. language evolves naturally and English could be said to be no more than a bastardisation of Latin (which in turn is a bastardisation of...), language and ideas are not perfectly analogous, I have ignored the importance context etc. etc.).

linguistics,"Recursion, Chomsky, and the Pirahã language","Hello everyone :)  
This post stems from a question I meant to ask [Dan Everett at his AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nar5c1/my_name_is_dan_everett_and_i_am_a_linguist/). Since I missed the AMA and I'm still quite confused about this subject, I'm wondering if any of you can help me understand it.

Essentially I'm trying to understand what people mean by 'recursion' in linguistics, especially as it relates to the debate between Chomsky and Everett over whether or not recursion is a universal property of language, and whether the lack of recursion in an individual language (Pirahã) would refute its universality.

What I understand by recursion is, essentially, the capacity to insert sentences into larger sentences, creating new sentences that are still grammatically correct. For example: ""he wants to eat"" can become ""he says that he wants to eat."" It's pretty obvious that in English this process could theoretically go on forever: you can stick together however many ""he says that"" or ""he wants to"" and the result is still grammatically correct, although it gets harder to follow (""he says that she says that they said that he wants to say that they said that....."").

Is my understanding of 'recursion' correct?  
And if it is correct, can anybody explain to me how Everett's research into the Pirahã language proves that this feature is not present in Pirahã?   
I haven't been able to find any actual examples of the language showing how somebody would express the concept ""he says that he wants to eat"". It seems logical to me that if you can express the concepts ""He says that he wants"" &amp; ""He wants to eat"" in Pirahã, it would follow that recursion is possible in the language, by which I mean that the sentence ""he said that he wants to eat"" would be totally understandable and grammatically correct, as would be larger more recursive variations. Everything that I've read/heard about Pirahã seems to skirt around the issue, and the main claim seems to be that Pirahã *doesn't show* recursion. But just because people aren't using recursion in everyday speech doesn't mean that speakers wouldn't readily understand a recursive sentence, and consider it grammatically viable.

I then said his first statement is incorrect and said today even though it’s a nice day he would rather go to the gym than play golf today. If he truly would rather play golf then he would go play golf today. 

He vehemently disagreed with me and said he needs to go to the gym because he needs to stay in shape.

He is confusing action vs result, and there for making a false statement by saying he would always rather play golf than go to the gym on a nice day. If that were the case, then he would play golf today. 

His desire to stay in shape outweighs the enjoyment he gets from golf. Therefore when making a simple decision and comparing the actions only, he would actually rather go to the gym than play golf today.

linguistics,My (uni paper) take on - How language and priming affect perception (Cognitive-Linguistics),"Imagine a blue horse skiing across an Olympics rink. It is amazing how our minds can create a vivid image of something we have never seen before using language, a hallmark of human existence. **I will be exploring the ways in which language affects our perception of the world – on an individual, social and global level. I will then be exploring the ways in which priming effects in media enhance language’s effects on our perception.** 

**Language structures** **affect how we remember things**. A study in eye-witness memory (Fausey, Boroditsky, 2010) found that English speakers remembered the agents of accidental events better than did Spanish speakers due to their agentive language; an English speaker would say “he dropped the vase” while a Spanish speaker would say “the vase was dropped”. Grammatical gender too affects the way we describe objects – “bridge” is feminine in Spanish and masculine in German, so speakers describe bridges as “beautiful” and “strong” respectively (Boroditsky, Schmidt, Phillips, 2003). Language affects how an individual remembers events and objects. 

Different structures of the same language can **denote the formality of social situations**. According to the Accommodation Theory (Giles, Coupland, Coupland, 1991), as social creatures, we deliberately converge our language patterns to fit in with the crowd. A local might code-switch to the less formal language structure to signal intimacy with fellow locals but use proper English when overseas to be perceived as educated – like a Singaporean saying “Is that so?” instead of the Singlish “Where got?”. Therefore, the language used in social situations affects one’s perception of its formality.  

Different pronunciations of the same language could also be used to **denote identity**. As found by Labov (1963) on Martha’s Vineyard, locals subtly and subconsciously varied their pronunciation to differentiate from standard American pronunciation norms brought over by mainland Americans holidaying there. The same can be said of different accents belonging to different states/countries, and an individual’s strategic choice to use the various accents available to them. These links between language structure/pronunciation and perceived identity becomes more important in our globalizing landscape. 

Language structures in media are crafted to **affect perceptions of stereotypes and agency**. Following the Marked Versus Unmarked theory (Jakobson, 1932), news like “Millennials are broke” frequently generalizes large groups of people like who depart from the insider group’s social norms. According to the Us Versus Them theory (Gumperz, 1982), this divide portrays the outsider group as inferior. The phrasing of headlines, like “Government raises tax” versus “Tax gets raised”, also affects our perception of agency. In this way, media language brings our attention to specific aspects of an event and specific traits of large groups, which is especially important to be aware of in the current fight against fake news. 

An interesting theory which further informs our perception of media language is the **cognitive phenomenon of Priming** (Horner, Henson, 2008), where exposure to a stimulus (the prime) influences its later identification and classification (the target). Priming is commonly used in media language, especially in advertising, **to create associations** and build desire for frivolous products. It is also used in propaganda - the Bush campaign launched a television ad containing a frame with the word “RATS” in a scaled-up font size during his campaign against Democrat Al Gore (Weinberger, Westen, 2008) to create negative associations for the democrats. Priming is therefore extremely dangerous as it builds subconscious perceptions/stereotypes. 

One form of priming is **associative priming, where item recognition improves after a related stimulus**. Associative priming is frequently used in subliminal marketing – as found by Vicary (1955), “priming consumers with the name of a thirst-quenching beverage makes it more likely that they will choose that beverage”. In another study, participants who had been primed by words associated with elderly stereotypes walked slower than those who had not been (Bargh, Chen, Burrows, 1996). Through the perceptions created by associative priming, language can be clearly seen to affect our behaviour. 

Another form is **repetition priming is when item recognition improves the more it is repeated**. This is most commonly seen in the bombardment of brand and slogans through various mediums. For example, celebrities are often used to endorse products since we can recognize faces even when they were seen in a different context and even with poor explicit memory of the face (Bruce, Carson, et al, 1998). A linguistic example is Nike’s “Just Do It” slogan, which increased Nike’s worldwide sales from $877 million to $9.2 billion from its launch in 1988 to 1998. Repetition priming gains credibility due to the Illusory Truth Effect – where familiarity is confused with credibility. 

Ultimately, the languages we likely grow up with affect our understanding of the world on an individual, social and global level, as described above. **As influential linguist Edward Sapir (1949) wrote, “The worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same worlds with different labels attached”.** While we discuss the influence on language on perception, the debate between the blurred lines of influence between language, culture and thought continues. It is therefore important to be aware of the influence of language in the ways we create our identities, treat each other and consume information.",1620754883,tartdesigns,7

* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

linguistics,"Linguists, is there any ambiguity in this word problem.","When I was 6  
My sister was half my age  
Now I’m 70  
How old’s my sister ?  

My position is that here is not enough information provided to be able to say. It could mean that my sister was half my age at that time, or half of six. Or that my sister was half my age now, half of 70. The reader is forced to make an assumption. The most common assumption is that it refers to the person’s age at that time, but neither one is correct or incorrect because it’s simply not specified. It’s intentional ambiguity to cause arguments. 

And an arguer states that:  
There's literally only one way to read it. ""when I was 6"" ""my sister was half my age"" meaning she was 3 when they were 6 ""now I'm 70"" you can do the math. If they didn't include the ""now"" when saying they were 70 then maybe your argument would have a leg to stand on but right now your simply dead wrong and doubling down like a fool

linguistics,Dark l pronunciation: the only pronunciation that I can't work out perfectly for a very long time,"For many years, I have a problem with pronouncing dark l in the right way. It is the only sound that I cannot pronounce correctly so as not to cause me problem.

To briefly mention my English backgrounds, I grew up in many different countries and have a mixed accent that tend to change depending on who I'm talking. I think for the 'l' sound I have the Korean accent and that gives me the problem.

I have read and seen so many posts and videos on how to pronounce the sound but I'm not sure if any of them worked for me or if I'm making the right sound. So I recorded myself pronouncing the same words with different ways I found on the internet. I would like it very much if you guys could tell me about it. I know my vowel sounds are not good here, but you guys can skip on them because I was focusing on the l sound.

&amp;#x200B;

I uploaded the files on Soundcloud because I couldn't upload them here: [https://soundcloud.com/user-331811824/sets/dark-l-pronunciations/s-NChzoSPbUff](https://soundcloud.com/user-331811824/sets/dark-l-pronunciations/s-NChzoSPbUff)

&amp;#x200B;

So here are the words that I pronounced and the ways I used to pronounce them:

Bill, felt, feel, pal, will, tell, all, ball, table, little, mall, shall, real, deal, seal, pill, doll, girl, world, poll, roll, bull, cool, full, fool, dull, null, rule, pull, pool, tool

Ways:

1. comfortably

2. In a Korean way

3. the way I learned from a video by an English girl

4. pulling the back of my tongue up

5. the way I learned from this (most likely) American girl living in Japan. She said to pull the tongue back first and then touch with my tongue tip the alveolar ridge (the area behind my upper teeth)

6. Making the sound by narrowing the space in the back of my mouth. I was doing this by narrowing the space between the back of my tongue and the soft palate (or even further inside. I'm not sure)

7. I followed a video by a Korean guy who said to make the sound as if you're making the sound in your throat.

&amp;#x200B;

linguistics,Why is written English so similar to spoken English?,"Most other languages with literary traditions of some time depth seem to have significant diglossia. With French, for example, there are noticeable grammatical differences between typical written French and typical spoken French: negation with *ne*, the acceptability of the *redoublement du sujet*, the simple past tense, and so on. Significant written-spoken differences also exist in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, despite the fact that all three had major language reforms within the past century specifically to make the written language more vernacular (言文一致).

And this isn't even getting to languages with full-on diglossia even today, like Arabic, Tamil, or Mongol (as used in China).

By contrast, it seems like written English is much more affected by spoken English—the main differences just seem to be in terms of vocabulary, without these sorts of grammatical differences. The distinction also seems much more permeable; people write English novels in quite colloquial language, but it would be very strange to write a Korean novel in the conversational speech level.

I have been reading Chomsky for a long time now and his book ""On Languages"" piqued my interest in Linguistics. Soon after, I started solving linguistics puzzles as a way to introduce myself to the subject. Earlier this year, I wrote the National Linguistics Olympiad and failed miserably. And mind you, I went in prepared for the Olympiad. I has solved the previous year papers made available by the organizing committee and I made sure that I solved all the questions exhaustively without leaving any part. One thing, I realized while I was writing the exam was the fact that the technique I employed to solve these puzzles was time-consuming, cumbersome and somewhat primitive.   
After the Olympiad, one of the organizer was kind enough to give me the instructors material that they use to teach the students who qualify that Olympiad. However, the techniques mentioned in the material were a little bit shrouded with ambiguity for I am totally uneducated in linguistics and its terminology.   
I have already been through this subreddit's wiki but nothing helped me in particular.

linguistics,Passives of Ditransitives,"I hope I have posted in the right location—I couldn't find the answer in beginners' textbooks. Essentially, I'm perplexed by agreement phrases in passivised ditransitives.

I've been (re-?)teaching myself syntax from the third edition of Andrew Carnie's *Syntax: A Generative Introduction*. I've been grappling with one of the exercises for chapter 14 on Expanded VPs (essentially v, AgrO, AgrIO). In the workbook, a number of related sentences are given for diagramming practice:

1. The waiter sent a free drink to the charming man.
2. A free drink was sent to the charming man.
3. The waiter sent the charming man a free drink.
4. The charming man was sent a free drink.

It's with sentence four that I run into difficulties. (The first two aren't actually ditransitive, right?) Carnie describes the passive *be* as selecting directly for a VP, rather than an AgrOP as an active v would do. Without AgrOP, the theme of the verb cannot be assigned accusative case &amp; thus for joint reasons of case assignment &amp; EPP moves to spec T where it takes the nominative.

However, in the solution for this problem the complement of the passive *be* is not a VP, but instead a vP. The complement of the lower v is AgrOP. The complement of the main verb moves to spec AgrOP; the spec of the lower vP moves to spec T. Here's an image of the tree: [https://imgur.com/a/1olO65l](https://imgur.com/a/1olO65l)

I have not been able to find anything on-line that confirms this, but it seems to me like a better characterisation of the passive construction is *not* that the passive v selects directly for a VP (it does not do so here) or that it drops AgrOP (AgrOP remains here), but rather that the highest level agreement phrase is axed. In this case, it's AgrIOP that is removed. Because in sentence 3, AgrIOP's complement was a vP rather than a VP, the passive v takes a vP complement (rather than the VP given in Carnie's description). Am I getting this right?

I'm aware that Minimalism has developed ways to address syntax without agreement phrases. However, my expectation is that I'll understand more recent theory better if I have a solid grasp of its development.

linguistics,How many tenses are there in English?,"At my university there was a hotly debated topic in the linguistics department, namely, how many tenses are there in English?  


When I was training to be an EFL teacher, I was taught that strictly speaking, English only has 2 tenses. The reasoning was that the technical definition of a tense is when an inflectional morphological change has occurred, so the only two examples of this in English would be the present simple, with the 3rd person singular *-s* suffix, and the past simple, with the *-ed* suffix. Temporal information could also be conveyed using the perfect constructions, or with the modal verb *will* to convey future actions, but these are not tenses, so I was told.   
However, at my university the various professors had differing views on this, some stating the use of the modal verb *will* to convey future actions is in fact a tense. It was all very controversial.  


Rodney Huddleston in his enormous book *The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language* states there are two 'tense systems'. **Primary tense**, he says, is present simple and past simple (or preterite as he says), is contrasted with **Secondary tense** which includes perfect (*have* \+ participle) and non-perfect. So this is another subtly different view on the matter.

But I can't formalize that intuition at all, and I'm curious whether anyone has. Might it have something to do with the ordering of affixes, too?",1620500217,yaikiyawun,7

LINGUISTICS:  the study of language(s).

I.    Idiolect:  [idio__self____    lect____speech____]     an individual variation on a language.

    HUH?  You are your own instrument.  Nobody speaks/communicates exactly like you.
    These three factors make your speech unique:

    A.    Suprasegmental features:  [supra___Above, beyond______    segmental______The parts/individual elements______]
                    [ It is not what you say, but how you say it.]
        l.  pitch levels--high/low sound frequency
            a.  English has 4 pitch levels.  Spanish has 3.  The highest level is used to register great excitement or to call attention.  Sustained usage of this highest level is extremely annoying to the listener. (See notes below. A1 pitch)

            b.  Little or no change in pitch is monotone.  Sustained usage of the same level is boring to the listener.
        
       2.  juncture--space/time between words
        a.  small juncture=nervousness, excitability, insincere (trying to convince/confuse)
        b.  large juncture=slow, struggling to think

    B.    Pronunciation:  is affected by
        l.  shape of the nasal passage    3.  vocal chords
        2.  palate                                       4.  teeth

    C.    Word Choice/Vocabulary.  You are your own dictionary.  The words you know and choose to use are affected by:
Teacher presents each category and gives an example or two. Afterwards students are divided in groups of four and they have to brainstorm examples and each category.

        l.    you are male or female/Your gender identification
        example #1 ____darling__
 Explain: A girl can say that’s a darling dress. What if a man says to another man that’s a darling tie? 
        example #2. Go Girlfriend
Explain: A girl can say, You go girlfriend. Can a man say the same thing to another man?
        
       2.  Age--your generation vs other generations
        example #1 far out, wicked 
Explain: Those are expressions from your grandparents generation to expressive great approval.
        example #2 _____________
Explain:_____________________________________________________________________________
        
       3.  Socio-economic level--socio=what you like to do, interests, level of education, friends economic=what you do for a living.  Your vocabulary is influenced by your interests, friends, job, level of education, etc.      jargon=job related vocabulary
           
         example #1 Dolly
Explain:  a hand truck used to haul heavy objects. Not a child’s toy  

        example #2 _____________
Explain:_____________________________________________________________________________

        4.  Geography/geographic area--where you live/what country/what area of that country

        example #1. Fixin’s
Explain:  Side dishes or condiments like Turkey dinner with all the Fixin’s

        example #2 _____________
Explain:_____________________________________________________________________________

                                                      
II.    Dialect:  [di two/Multiple_    lect_speech___]  a shared social or geographic variation on a language.    Texans speak differently than New Yorkers.  You can tell a Yank from a Brit, a Brit from an Aussie.  

    A.  Pronunciation  Canadian pronunciation of House or about versus American pronunciation. British pronunciation of schedule versus American.

      B.  Word Choice Americans say hood of a car/British say the bonnet. The British say biscuit/Americans say cookie.     

Show addition IIB

Mexican Spanish, Argentina Spanish, Iberian Spanish are dialects of Spanish, not different languages.  When people say speak American, they are referring to the various American dialects—Bostonian, Southern, etc. American is NOT A LANGUAGE!!!!!!!!


III.    Language:  mutually intelligible means of communication.
In the long, long ago in the distant past, if people who spoke different dialects were separated by time and space, those dialects could become so different that they morfed into different languages. There differences became so great that they could no longer communicate easily. 


IV.    Family:  a group of related languages.  
    A.  Romance (Latin based):  Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, etc.

    [English is special.  Much of its vocabulary is Romance/Latin based, but English grammar is a mixed of Romance and Germanic influences.  You can thank the Angles/Saxons (Germanic) and the Romans/Normans (Romance).    Remember the Norman invasion of 1066!!

    B.  Germanic:  German, English, Norwegian, Swedish, etc.

Stereotype:  a general statement meant to characterize an entire  group/category, usually negative.

Linguistics lecture page 3

Did you ever wonder why English has one word for the name of the animal but a different word for the meat of the same animal?

Pig but pork.                                     Puerco.......carne de puerco                        
Cow/Cattle but beef.                        Res............carne de res
Bird/Chicken but poultry.                 Pollo...........carne de pollo

“Pig”, “cow”, “chicken” come from the Germanic based language of the Anglo-Saxons. The lower classes, who took care of the live animals, used those words for them, but hardly ever got to eat them. The Anglo-Saxons had been conquered by the French speaking Franks. So, the lower class Anglo-Saxons referred to the animal in the field as a pig, but when the pig was prepared as food and served to the upper class Franks, the French word was used, pork.... And that’s why English has one set of words for living animals and a different set for their meat. Over time, the Germanic Language of the Anglo-Saxons merged with Latin French of the Franks to result in English. English vocabulary and grammar are a combination of the two influences.

The two influences can also be seen when forming plural nouns in English.

Latin influence… Add an S to the end of the noun to make the plural.

                   Hat… Hats         Car… Cars

Germanic influence… Make an internal change to   Woman… Women          Man....Men

Spanish never ha a Germanic influence. So, in Spanish, we add an S to the end of the noun when the noun ends in a vowel. If the noun ends in a consonant, we add ES.

Coche....Coches                    Uva......Uvas
Reloj...Relojes                       Rincón.....Rincones

A1 Explanation of pitch levels

English has four levels (from level one being the lowest, to level four, the highest), whereas Spanish has three levels. These are relative pitches, as everybody's basic pitch level will be different. Level two is known as the “mid” pitch, with level three being slightly higher, and level one slightly lower.

English.   A typical intonation pattern in English is with “informational” questions. Usually, when someone asks “where are you going?” in a natural setting, the pitch pattern starts on level two and moved up to level three.

Spanish.   If we apply the English intonation to Spanish information questions, it will sound wrong to them. Spanish speakers use a falling intonation, or a rise and then a fall for added emphasis.  The Spanish pitch starts a level two and then moves down to level one. So, An English speaker may not recognize this as a question. This is why, sometimes your world language teacher may ask you to repeat, and you wonder why because you think you have the correct grammar and vocabulary. The teacher may just want to work on your pitch.

SNL. Example of pitch… He doesn’t care what they say, it’s how they say it.

linguistics,Where to start with linguistics? (as a language learner),"Hi,

I'd really appreciate of your well-informed opinions on where I should start with linguistics.

I am a university language student, and I am very much interested in learning about linguistics, particularly as a means to better understand the languages which I learn. I doubt I'd be so interested in the areas of linguistics that appear more theoretical, or at least don't have as much of a practical application in gaining a more comprehensive understanding of current modern languages. Of course however, if you think learning about those things is important and relevant, then please say so, since it is likely that I am just making an uneducated assumption to the extent of their relevance to better understanding the languages which I learn.

I would really like to have the resources, knowledge, critical thinking abilities to understand where the languages I learn came from, what contact they have had (or currently are having) with each other and with other languages, and why they are the way they are. I understand this might sound vague, but I think that's simply because I don't yet have the information required to appropriately express what I want to learn. If you think that I should provide more specific information, then let me know, and I'll do so.

If it would be of help in providing me with advice, then I can partially explain a question that I am still looking for the answer to. I don't want to state too much information, because I'm thinking of making this a research question, and don't want somebody to steal it lol (sorry). I have also checked the relevant language's linguistics journals and searched the internet pretty heavily (imo), but I can't find the answer to this at all: in one of the languages I learn, there is a letter which differs in its pronunciation depending on its phonetic surroundings/quality (those might not be the right terms, sorry). However, there is also another possible pronunciation which occurs, where it sounds like it is either deleted or rendered into some sort of semi-vowel (I can't quite tell, and don't know enough about the sounds to tell). Is linguistics the kind of thing to learn about to begin to be able to answer this type of question? And is this the sort of thing one could turn into a dissertation? Again, if I need to be more precise, then please let me know.

Thanks for reading this, and thanks very much in advance for any replies.

linguistics,Are mixed-origin names fairly recent?,"This may apply to other European-language countries as well, but (non-English) “English” names (ie typical names in English-speaking countries) come from various linguistic origins.

I know, in English it sounds dumb. But for some/a lot of Dutch people it also sounds dumb in Dutch. 

The argument is that a lot of people already used this grammar and a lot of people disagree with it. They will say that it's wrong. (I personally use both)

But wasn't it a rule that if many native speakers speak in a certain way that that would become a new rule and a valid way of speaking a language.

linguistics,Revival Effort of an Endangered Language,"Wunya ngulum! So I was born and raised in South East Queensland where the Gabi-Gabi people Used To live. I had the thought a while ago that I should learn their language out of respect. After a bit of research I learned that while the Gabi-Gabi people are still definitely around, the language is nearly wholly dead; no speakers, very little recorded speaking, and I can only find one book pertaining to it and one of its dialects (the Butchala dialect, circa. 20 speakers), which I have found at the state library.
I am definitely not expecting anyone here to know a lick of Gabi-Gabi, but I was hoping that someone would be able to give some advice on how I might go about conducting a revival effort? For anyone outside of Australia, just know that the racism here is still thick in the air; a shocking amount of pakeha still consider the Aboriginal people to be animals, but that is a problem for another post. My point is that the culture, language, and history is not taught in schools at all, and so resources are dearth. 
I feel like if I can get my hands on all the material I find, and use it to start piecing the language back together, I can begin to learn it. I believe that if I can connect to the community, I can share my knowledge and give back to the people that once tended to the land on which I was born.
Thoughts? Advice? I'm honestly kinda stuck on this, it's very shunned to do really anything nice for aboriginal people, me being white and all, but I believe that if this can work, and the people can reclaim their language.

linguistics,When a foreign language makes it an obligation to determine something that can be left undetermined in your own language.,"It’s in the title. Have you ever come accross this phenomenon? Do you know what it’s called?

For example, if your native language is Polish and you’re learning English, you’re perfectly satisfied with the sentence: ""Cat is on table"". Of course, you’ve heard your teacher’s explanation, ""the cat"" means the only relevant cat in your narrative context, while ""a cat"" means one cat among many other possible cats. Same thing with the table. But it gets really puzzling and challenging when they insist that choosing between ""a"" and ""the"" is not only an option, it’s an obligation.

Now let’s look at an English speaker learning Polish, whenever they use an infinitive verb, they have to chose between the following: imperfective (for ongoing or repeated actions) or perfective (for actions that are complete or exhausted). And here again, the English speaker can’t just say ""I need to call my friend"", they also have to determine whether they mean ""to call"" as a complete action or as an ongoing action.

Now imagine that our Englishman and our Pole are learning Thai. When they use a simple pronoun such as ""you"" or ""me"", they have to determine the age difference and the type of relationship (hierarchy, familiarity) between the people involved. When they qualify or count a noun, they must add a classifier, which is some type of generic category word. Very often there are several classifiers to chose from. So you can’t just say ""we have two solutions"" (counted noun) or ""we have a good solution"" (qualified noun), you need to chose a classifier which in this case can be the word ""story"" (story works as a classifier for many abstract nouns) or the word ""path"". So basically you need to determine whether you mean ""solution"" as a story or as a path.
 
A Thai speaker learning English will probably find it both interesting and difficult to have the obligation to chose a tense every time they use a verb, since verb tenses are undetermined in Thai (although they can also be defined by adverbs).

Please note that I’m not refering to cases where a language gives you the possibility to be specific where your own language is vague, whithout forcing you to be specific, but rather to cases when that becomes an obligation.

Btw, I´m not an English native speaker and I will make some mistakes in this text for sure, I´m sorry in advance.

What I was wondering is, why more archaic forms of English look and sound so nice and kind of natural in fantasy books like Tolkien's The Hobbit or LOTR but the same doesn't happen in Spanish. I assume that for this question to be answered I will  need a linguist that is Spanish or has studied Spanish. Thing is, the fantasy genre spins around English, but I have noticed that there's not so much written in Spanish, and those books in Spanish are written in a completely modern Spanish. I feel like more archaic forms of Spanish are looked down upon. It sounds old, but in a bad way, outdated and kind of ridiculous. There are not fantasy books in Spanish that I know that are written in Cervantes Spanish style for example. They don't seem to sound epic in Spanish, while in English the contrary seems to happen and I don't understand why. I mean, Tolkien can use a lot of archaisms in his books and it is still appealing to readers nowadays, but I can't imagine a Spanish writer doing the same and succeeding.

linguistics,Small ‘e’ over ‘y’? [orthography],"Hi! I remember some time ago I saw a post featuring an old grave marker in New England, which featured what I can only describe as “the letter y, with a significantly smaller e directly above it”. Reading through the comments someone claimed it was a shortening of the word ‘and’. 

I haven’t been able to find the post since then, and neither have I been able to find any corroborating information. So I wanted to ask a few questions:

- Is this true?
- Is there a specific name or term for the ‘grapheme’?
- Where did it originate? When did it fall out of style?
- Are there any other resources about this?

I'm trying to find out more about the history and etymology of [Ngai Hakka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng%C3%A1i_people). I'm pretty fluent in Ngai and I grew up speaking it with my mom. Funny thing is, I don't know anything about the people or the history. According to the wiki page, there are only 1,649 Ngai people living today. I can probably count all the times I've ever met someone who speaks Ngai on one hand. They were all elderly and were all surprised that someone like me could speak it fluently. (I'm 25, for context). I've met a couple of people my age who understood Ngai but couldn't speak it. When I was doing undergrad, my linguistics professor became interested in  Ngai Hakka and wanted to document this language. I guess this is what started this spark of curiosity.

In the transition between Old English and Middle English, all vowels at the end of words became schwa. In Late Middle English, these schwas disappeared. 

However, in monosyllabic words they were kept. Also, \[x\] and \[ç\] disappeared, thus allowing a few vowels to appear at the end of words, though due to breaking into a diphthong ending in /u/ and /i/ before \[x\] and \[ç\] respectively, the vowels are quite limited, with /a/ turning into /au/, which turned into /ɔː/. Also, /ij/ reduced to /iː/, creating a few more words with final vowels. 

The second and the third changes didn't allow ""a"" to appear at the end of words, and for some reason there weren't any monosyllabic words ending in ""a"".

linguistics,Single word vs sentence stimuli in multilingual speakers. How accepted is Michael Paradis on this issue?,"I'll quote from his forward in The Handbook of the Neuroscience of Multilingualism   
  

  ""Another widely applicable finding is that results cannot be generalized from single  
words to language in any study of multilingualism, including language lateralization,  
neuroimaging studies, pre‐surgical electrical stimulation, or diagnosis and therapy.  
Single words are the least likely candidates for investigating language representation,  
given that what makes language most specific as a cognitive function, namely the  
language system (phonology, morphology, syntax), is supported by procedural memory,  
whereas isolated words, being explicitly known form‐meaning associations, are  
supported by declarative memory and hence are less focalized in their cortical representation. Neuroimaging studies using single words as stimuli show no difference between  
monolingual and bilingual individuals, whereas studies that use sentences as stimuli  
do. Not only can results obtained with single‐word stimuli not be generalized to the  
representation and processing of language (in the way that one normally cannot  
generalize from a part to the whole), but experiments that use such stimuli address a  
component that differs radically from the language system.""

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

 * Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

 * Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

 * Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

 * Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

 * English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

These types of questions are subject to removal:

 * Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.

 * Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.

linguistics,Is SEE (Signed Exact English) considered a language?,"Hello all. I have been in a thread elsewhere where I am debating whether or not SEE (Signed Exact English) is considered a language. Another user is arguing that ASL (American Sign Lanuage) is a language and SEE is not, whereas I am arguing that both ASL and SEE are languages. The interesting bit, and point of contention, is in regards to how the two respective languages came about. I am here because I am now interested to see and hear what the linguistic community has to say and if anyone has anything to contribute. 

I will let you know that I am a native ASL user, but a lot of my native ASL was lost and replaced with SEE, and as a result I sign a blend of ASL/SEE. Signing is not my primary mode of communication- I actually primarily use spoken English as my language of choice and will identify as an English speaker, although not a native English speaker. I am fluent in both English and ASL/SEE blend, and have basic understanding of Spanish. 

For the sake of this question, I would like responses that put aside how one feels about SEE, because the language itself is highly controversial, hated, and despised among the Deaf community- and that is whole 'nother can of worms- so if possible, please keep opinions on that issue out as much as possible.

ASL developed naturally among the Deaf community, evolving much in the same way that spoken languages developed. SEE, on the other hand, came about due to English speakers with knowledge of ASL deciding that a ""better' signed language was needed to teach Deaf the grammar of English, and thus believed they needed to address the wrongness of ASL because it didn't follow English grammar and conventions. So SEE was purposely developed and then forced upon the Deaf community at large, and in many cases was forced upon the Deaf to such an extent that native ASL users were told that their language was wrong and/or incorrect and SEE was the correct language- (similar to how Blacks were told that AAVE was incorrect English.)

I argue that given the definition of what language is- both ASL and SEE are languages, however, I recognize ASL as being a natural or true language- as it developed similarly to how all languages are developed among a group of people or culture. SEE however is different- it was not developed naturally among a group of people- it was developed by native English speakers for another community- the Deaf peoples, and then systematically forced upon the Deaf community as a whole.

I argue that SEE is a language, but not a true language. Interestingly enough, as far as I know- SEE is the only language that was purposely created with the express intention for it to be used by a community that didn't create it. SEE was created by taking ASL and forcing it it follow strict English grammar, syntax, and conventions. As a result, signs had to be modified and/or invented to cover such instances where something in English didn't exist in ASL. For example, the -ed ending in English doesn't exist in ASL, so a hand-sign was invented expressly for signifying -ed on a verb. Walk vs. walked.

I am going to link the comment thread that started the debate on ASL vs SEE as languages. Start at the 4th comment down, as the ones before it address the question the post asked and isn't very relevant to the ASL vs SEE question I am here about. ([https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/n2s9ro/jehovas\_witnesses\_are\_sneaking\_into\_my\_apartment/gwpp7ef?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/n2s9ro/jehovas_witnesses_are_sneaking_into_my_apartment/gwpp7ef?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) 

If you don't want to follow the link, here is the back and forth, copied and pasted:

**Me:** A lot of Deaf who are my age and were mainstreamed picked up that blend because ASL was primarily used in schools until the big push to strictly use SEE (which failed massively). My particular age group had enough ASL mastery and were forced to switch to SEE. As a result many recognized the benefits of SEE to English because of its literal translation of English to sign.

A lot of Deaf that I meet who do well within the hearing world regardless of whether or not they are able to verbally speak English have, to some degree, an understanding of both ASL and SEE. Nearly all Deaf that fall into this category tend to either be mostly ASL or verbal English users by choice.

Very few use ASL/SEE blend. And even less use straight SEE.

**Them:** SEE was only supposed to be used for teaching english - so sad that teachers / administrators have convinced hearing parents to force their kids to use it. and it hurts interpreters! 

it’s not even a language &amp; it’s certainly not grammatically correct.

**Me:** SEE follows English grammar and structure- so technically it is a language. It is a literal word for word translation of English in sign. SEE actually has tense and endings like English does (-ed, -ing, -ly) and requires strict adherence to English grammar rules.

As far as I know, it's the only language to have been developed and forced onto a group of people.

For example, both Spanish and English follow their own grammar rules. So they have their own structure to say the same thing.

English: I live in the grey house.

Spanish: Vivo en la casa gris.

What SEE did was to take the signs, and put them in English grammar &amp; structure to make sign ""correct"" and thus, it was like forcing Spanish to follow English grammar or vice versa.

Applying that to the Spanish- English example, it'd be like English speakers forcing Spanish language to follow English grammar rules and vice versa.

English: I live in the grey house. 

Force English to follow Spanish rules: I live in the house grey.

Spanish: Vivo en la casa gris. 

Force Spanish to follow English rules: Yo vivo en la gris casa.

Then to make it worse, they invented signs to add English that doesn't exist (or isn't used often) into sign. Tenses in ASL typically are indicated by spacial location of the word signed and context. Run/ran/running, for example, all use the same hand sign- and is literally translated into English as ""run"" no matter which tense it would be if it followed English rules.

Instead run signed close to your shoulder typically translates into the past tense ""ran"", run signed in front of chest area close to the body translates to the present tense- ""run"", and run signed in front of the chest area but further out from the body indicates the future or present progressive form of run- ""running/will run.""

SEE forced tenses into literal signs- required signs to add -ly, -ing,-ed, -er, (etc.) and wouldn't accept these to be left out because then the English was wrong. This slowed the signing down dramatically, so it took 2-3x as long to say the sentence as it normally would otherwise.

SEE does qualify as a language, and does have a set of correct grammar and structure it needs to follow. On that qualifier alone, SEE is a language.

However, SEE didn't develop on its own through culture and natural development by a people. SEE was developed by native English speakers who knew and understood ASL and decided that the grammar and structure of ASL was wrong because it didn't follow English rules, so therefore ASL needed to be corrected, and forced to follow English conventions.

Imagine if native English speakers knew and understood Spanish- but decided that the language was structurally wrong and went and told all Spanish speaking peoples- ""Hey- you're speaking Spanish wrong- you need to order your sentences like this..."" and then forced Spanish words to follow English convention.

The same thing happened with AAVE, African African Vernacular English. Black people were told by English speaking white people that their English was wrong- and tried to force the Black community to speak ""correct English"" because they didn't or couldn't recognize that AAVE has its own pattern, grammar, and structure.

**Them:** sorry, no, SEE is not a language. it’s a system, using morphemes from ASL &amp; grammar from english. \[and it’s ugly\]. it resembles a language, but has no internal structure; instead it is kitbashed together from 2 true languages, and unlike PSE, is unnatural. also, it is the choice of few Deaf adults, who do actually use the pidgen/contact system of PSE.

SEE-II is not considered a language itself like ASL; rather it is an invented system for a language—namely, for English. from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing\_Exact\_English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_Exact_English)

Signing Exact English (SEE) is a sign system that matches signs with the English language \[ from a page that lauds SEE - [https://www.handsandvoices.org/comcon/articles/see.htm](https://www.handsandvoices.org/comcon/articles/see.htm)

Signed Exact English is a system to communicate in English through signs and fingerspelling. Signed Exact English, in most cases, uses English grammar (that is, you are signing English). from: [https://www.signingsavvy.com/blog/45/The+difference+between+ASL+and+English+signs](https://www.signingsavvy.com/blog/45/The+difference+between+ASL+and+English+signs)

**Me:** I see your point on it not being a language. I'd argue that it is, since it does have grammar, syntax, etc. however, I recognize that it isn't a true language since it didn't develop naturally.

Language is complex, but if it has rules and conventions that dictate the ordering, I'd consider it a language.

Since a lot of research involving ASL and SEE focuses on how ASL evolved, the link between the two and its connections to English, pros/cons of SEE with applications to teaching the Deaf the English conventions, and/or how SEE was designed with a goal in mind- there is very little about debating whether or not SEE is a language in and of itself.

However, language develops over time, and the fact that a small portion of Deaf people have adopted the use of SEE in their daily lives, means that SEE had started to become a language, and is recognized as a language among the Deaf community.

Most Deaf recognize SEE as a language, albeit a very hated and controversial language due to the fact that it was developed and forced onto the deaf community as a whole.

It may not be recognized academically yet as its own language, but it is relatively new- an infant as far as a language goes.

Is it a viable language? I don't know. But the fact that SEE has continued to be used, and is still around despite the fact that it is hated and despised by much of the very people it was created for and forced upon doesn't negate that it meets the basic criteria for what a language is.

There are several definitions for language. But what makes a language a language?

Henry Sweet proposes that “Language is the expression of ideas by means of speech-sounds combined into words. Words are combined into sentences, this combination answering to that of ideas into thoughts.”

Bernard Bloch and George L. Trager proposed that “A language is a system of arbitrary vocal symbols by means of which a social group cooperates.”

[https://www.britannica.com/topic/language](https://www.britannica.com/topic/language)

Both of these define language in terms of relation to vocality- the use of voice and sounds arranged in a way to communicate.

Note, by those two definitions- ASL wouldn't be considered a language because a vocal component isn't part of ASL. Given that ASL has only just begun to be recognized as a language of its own- those proposed definitions of what is a language do struggle a bit.

Noam Chomsky defines language as “a set (finite or infinite) of sentences, each finite in length and constructed out of a finite set of elements"" and by this definition ASL qualifies as a language. Furthermore, this same criteria can be applied to SEE, thus SEE also qualifies as a language.

Making a language that worked with all of these characteristics in a way that felt natural would be really difficult.

Lots of Malayo-polynesian languages also have a variety of foreign influences. Malay and Indonesian have Arabic, Dutch, and English influence, while Filipino has significant Spanish influence. I've noticed that native Malayo-polynesian words are seen as more informal than corresponding loanwords (aku vs saya for example). If you spoke a Malayo-polynesian reconstruction or Interlingua, maybe it would come off as uneducated or mean?",1619990440,Orangutanion,4
linguistics,Recording of UNKNOWN spoken language. Possibly 'Ancient Sumerian'. Who can help with translation?,"Someone posted this in another thread as part of an investigstion into their friend's experience.

The summary, according to the person who recorded it is as follows:

A meditation session over the phone, between friends, with psychic channeling intents. At one point the person on the other end, a French male without any connection to the Middle-East or Africa started speaking this language during the call. He apparently spoke for a while, not as himself, but a being from somewhere else. When asked, the 'voice' said through the guy, that it is related to Ancient Sumerian.

The metaphysical aspects are just for context and irrelevant to this. The recording exists, and it needs trsnslation. I am not a linguist and it beats me. It would really help me, the uploader and the two people who recorded it... and maybe your own curiosity, if we could descifer it.

Notes:

• The words 'Enki' and 'Ra' are relevant in this context.

• I transcribed the recording best I could in a made-up syntax to make sense of it. It sounds like a poem. The rythm of recitation is also very 'greek poem'-like.

• A few words towards the end are too whispered for me to transcribe.

• There seem to be pronouns, and there seems to be a story to it.

Thank you very much for any contribution you could bring. The main questions are:

**What language is it?**

**What does it say?**

To make a more specific example, let's assume that a non-Indo-European language was spoken across some islands of the Aegean, like the Cyclades and Rhodes; would it be realistic to think that the language might have survived after the Mycenean (and therefore Indo-European) colonization/conquest of the islands around 1450 BC, and perhaps continued to be spoken by farmers and other illiterate parts of the population during the Mycenean rule and during the Greek Dark Ages (so up to the 8th century BC)?

Herodotus, for example, [wrote (56-58)](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/1B*.html#56) about the Pelasgians and reported that the inhabitants of Placia and Scylace (in Ancient Mysia, so present-day Sea of Marmara) and of the 'city of Creston' (it is unclear if Creston referred to Kreston in Ancient Macedonia or to the Etruscan city of Cortona/Curtun) still spoke a non-Greek language, perhaps being or having originated from Pelasgian, during his times.

&gt;For the people of Creston and Placia have a language of their own in common, which is not the language of their neighbours; and it is plain that they still preserve the fashion of speech which they brought with them in their migration into the places where they dwell.

linguistics,Elsdon Pinyin,"Repost from r/ChineseLanguage

Hello everyone,

As my name suggests, I am deeply interested in languages. Chinese is my seventh which I started nearly ten years ago.

I have been spending some time trying to design a more consistent and efficient system of Romanising Mandarin Chinese with less letters and diacritics. I know this might seem a bit eccentric, and I have deep respect for both the Wade-Giles and Hanyu, but I am quite pleased with the result. I have got rid of &lt;w&gt; which, like Romance languages, is always represented by &lt;u&gt;, &lt;y&gt; which is always represented by &lt;i&gt;, and &lt;x&gt;, &lt;q&gt; and &lt;j&gt; because they are already palatalised allophones of &lt;s&gt;, &lt;c&gt; and &lt;z&gt; respectively. &lt;yi&gt; is just &lt;i&gt;, &lt;yu&gt; is &lt;iu&gt; and &lt;wu&gt; is also just &lt;u&gt;. I also turned &lt;ao&gt; into &lt;au&gt; to make it more consistent with the norm in European languages and its phonemic value.

The orthographical systems of Italian, German, Latin, Portuguese, Spanish, in addition to pre-existing pinyin systems, helped me create this.

This post is not an exhaustive representation of my system, but it can give you a feel for it.

**First tone** = double vowel (core vowel in diphthong), e.g. *maa*; *uaai*

**Second tone** = &lt;h&gt; final, e.g. *mah*; *uaih*

**Third tone** = acute accent + &lt;h&gt; final, e.g. *màh*; *uàih*

**Fourth tone** = acute accent, e.g. *mà*; *uài*

**Neutral tone** = no change, e.g. *ma*; *uai*

Example:

**Hanyu Pinyin**

Wo3 de wei4lai2 yu3 ta1 tong2zai4

Wo3 yao3 qu4 xun2zhao4 wo3 de zhen1ai4

Tao2 li da4hai4

Cai2neng2 rong2ru4 shi4jie4 de shou3 huai2

linguistics,Yod-dropping in 'curious'?,"I'm interested in something that I first noticed around 2010, and have encountered it a few times more since then, that some people seem to drop the yod after the first consonant in 'curious,' and occasionally in words similar to curious (furious, etc).

I've also noticed a few other people I know personally who do it (one of those is from Texas, and has a moderately noticeable accent), and here and there in the media.

Is this documented anywhere, or does anyone know why this is occurring? It's fascinating to me, because I know that yod-dropping is very common with words like 'news' and 'student', but this phenomenon seems to be relatively new, or at least not common enough to make it sound like a ""normal"" accent variant to me.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**1.** Compose a coherent (Modern) English sentence at least five words long (without using proper names) that *consists entirely of* *non-native words and morphemes*.   
&gt;  
&gt;For the purposes of this exercise, we will count as “native” any English words that are traceable (according to AHD) back to a “Germanic root” (and that have not been borrowed into English), as well as words whose etymologies show a pattern “Middle English &lt; Old English”, whether originating in Old English (with no Germanic root specified) or descending directly from a specified Proto-Indo-European root (as in the standard type of “native” word discussed and illustrated in lectures).   
&gt;  
&gt;Note carefully the specification of non-native *morphemes,* in addition to non-native *words*! Thus there are some common native morphemes that you cannot use, including the following:  
&gt;  
&gt; • the verb ending *-s* that marks 3 sg. forms (“he/she/it” forms, like “he/she paints”, etc.). This means that even though *paint* is a borrowed word, you cannot use the actual form *paints* (as in “she paints”).  
&gt;  
&gt; • the ending *-(e)s* that marks plural forms of most nouns (like *cat**s*)  
&gt;  
&gt; • the dental suffix of “weak verbs” (thus a form like *painted* cannot be used, even though *paint* is borrowed)   
&gt;  
&gt; • the *-ly* ending (used to make adverbs; thus *clear* is borrowed, but *clear**ly* cannot be used)   
&gt;  
&gt; • the suffix *-ness* (used to make abstract nouns)  
&gt;  
&gt; • the negative prefix *un-*  
&gt;  
&gt; • the suffix *-ing* (in all of its meanings/usages)  
&gt;  
&gt; • definite and indefinite articles, including *a/an/the/some*  
&gt;

It’s just something I can feel. Even the most perfect English from Americans here, I can still hear small inflections or vowel changes in tiny words with people who speak other languages but have fluent English.

linguistics,From which Germanic language did German originate?,"Disclaimer: I know German came from Early New High German, which in turn came from Middle High German, which in turn came from Old High German. But the question I want to know the answer to is which West Germanic language did Old High German come from? Having done some research, this is what I can only conclude. 

According to some linguists, the West Germanic languages could be traced to three major branches: **North Sea Germanic** (Ingvaeonic), **Weser-Rhine Germanic** (Istvaeonic), and **Elbe Germanic** (Irminonic). Out of the West Germanic languages, German, which originates from High German, seems to be the most ambiguous in origin. 

**North Sea Germanic**: 

* **Anglo-Frisian**
   * English/Scots (languages)
   * Frisian (languages)
* **Saxon**
   * Low German (language)

**Weser-Rhine Germanic**: 

* **Franconian**
   * Low Franconian
      * Dutch/Flemish/Afrikaans (languages)
      * Limburgish (language)
   * Central Franconian \**classified as Central German (High German)*
      * Ripuarian (dialect)
      * Moselle Franconian/Luxembourgish (languages)
   * Rhine Franconian *\*classified as Central German (High German)*
      * Hessian (dialect)
      * Palatine (dialect)
   * High Franconian *\*classified as Upper German (High German)*
      * East Franconian (dialect)
      * South Franconian (dialect)

**Elbe Germanic**:

* Alemannic (dialect) *\*classified as Upper German (High German)*
* Bavarian (dialect) *\*classified as Upper German (High German)*
* Thuringian (dialect) *\*classified as Central German (High German)*
* Lombardic (language) *\*extinct; classified as Upper German* 

Based on this list, we can rule out the possibility that German originated from the North Sea Germanic branch. However, it gets more complicated in the Elbe Germanic and Weser-Rhine Germanic branches. In those two branches, we see an overlap between the Upper and Central dialects of High German. This means that Elbe Germanic and Weser-Rhine Germanic branches are not synonymous to Upper German and Central German branches of High German. 

* Elbe Germanic =/= Upper German
* Elbe Germanic =/= Central German
* Weser-Rhine Germanic =/= Central German
* Weser-Rhine Germanic =/= Upper German

Additionally, we see that different languages Dutch/Flemish, Afrikaans, Limburgish, and Luxembourgish share the same branch as some of the German dialects. Based on this information, I can only conclude that the German language is a hybrid between the Elbe and Weser-Rhine Germanic branches, or the Upper and Central branches of High German. But which is the correct categorization? 

Initially, I hypothesized that the Elbe and Weser-Germanic branches used to be the original categorization, but overtime, parts of these branches assimilated into one language (High German) as the German states were being unified under Prussia after Napoleon dissolved the Holy Roman Empire, hence a standard language was needed. This would mean that the whole classification of Central and Upper German came as a result of the creation of the standard German language, which, in this context, makes more sense to divide in such groups, as the Elbe and Weser-Rhine model would prove to be archaic and irrelevant for including other languages like Dutch and Luxembourgish (some Germans don't even see this as a separate language).

But then I checked the date Old High German was spoken (750 - 1050 AD). This completely debunked my hypothesis, as Prussia did not even exist then. Then I reformulated a new hypothesis that perhaps the assimilation of parts of the Elbe and Weser-Rhine Germanic branches was already occurring way prior to even the Holy Roman Empire (800 - 1806). But what event could have led to the assimilation of the two branches? Geographic contact perhaps? From my understanding,

""A language is a dialect with an army and a navy."" - Max Weinheirt.

This means that all languages are dialects that possess a political status, as they are enforced and protected by a government. As mentioned, some Germans don't see Luxembourgish as a different language, but instead a dialect of German. However, this notion that Luxembourgish is a language comes from the fact that Luxembourg is its own country, with its own political system, separate from Germany. Therefore, delineating the boundary between language and dialect is purely arbitrary. Additionally, languages and dialects flow in a geographic continuum. Someone from Berlin may perceive the German spoken in Switzerland or Alsace as a different language from German, but someone from Baden-Württemberg may think otherwise, as they all speak a form of the Alemannic dialect of German. It is all relative to proximity. 

The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 granted independence to most of the non-German speaking part of the Holy Roman Empire, including Switzerland, which is predominantly German speaking today. Did that mean that most of the head of the German states did not perceive Swiss German as a form of German? How come today linguist consider Swiss German to be part of Old High German? 

Based on the list, it seems that at one point, Dutch and some of the German dialects used to also be one language (Frankish). But overtime, they diverged, for some unknown reason, and the German Franconian dialects ended up assimilating with the dialects of the Elbe Germanic branch to form Old High German. But how come the Low Franconian dialects that became Dutch did not assimilate to become High German as well? We see Switzerland and Austria break away from the Holy Roman Empire, yet their main language are still considered a form of High German. Is the Elbe, Weser-Rhineland, and North Sea Germanic model just wrong? What do you think?",1619637726,Lissandra_Freljord,44

Sidebar: I'm not saying colonialism led to a better world. That would be to leave the baby in the with the bathwater. There are better ways for humanity to grow than to subjugate entire nations. We can see that now.

But spreading better political systems is good. Immigration and emigration can be good. Improving  countrys trade and access to resources can be good. Technology is changing rapidly (duh). But so is culture. A global culture is emerging. International awareness is increasing. Where an individual could only trust his countrymen 50 years ago, now people play games together around the world and share the same memes and news cycle. A global conscious is growing.

I believe this is good.

That is why I seek a word for ""good"" colonialism. If global culture is good, then its spread is good. If international community is good, then its spread is good. If a global conscious is good (I believe this will allow humans to fight even less, share more, reduce emissions, and understand our place in the universe more), then again, spreading it and growing it is good. 

So what is a word that captures this optimistic view of things?",1619583973,_Bad_Ideas_,3

linguistics,How much closely did old tibetan pronounce the letters in the spelling of tibetan words (script or wylie)?,"In many ways, it seems likely to me that old tibetan did pronounce nearly all of them, as unusual as that may seem for modern Lhasa tibetan. But I met a native speaker who argues firmly against this idea and says that languages like ladakhi (who still pronounce many consonants that Lhasa tibetan doesnt) simply developed in a way that they started to pronounce those letters some day, while others stayed ""original and true to old tibetan"" which would essentially imply that old tibetan didn't pronounce the letters and simply added them in to distinguish homophones, but it makes no comments on why certain letters are silent and others arent, or how the silent letters affect vowel qualities (such as bod being phö) and tones in those tibetic langs that do not pronounce them, as opposed to those liek ladakhi who do (and dont have tones as well). Apart from this, the fact that some homophones are grammatically distinct forms of the same word (in the sense of verb tenses to be precise) and are written with distinct spelling for each form make me wonder if what the native speaker believes has any truth to it. And it doesn't help that the tibetan script was invented from brahmi, a highly phonetic script itself. Why would tibetans borrow such a script and use it completely differently from its phonetic values from the very start of writing their language? 

So how was old tibetan most likely pronounced, and what were the likely phonological changes, so that I may know if there is truth to what the native speaker believes or if it is just to be taken with a grain of salt?

I'm curious though, because if we always calculate the information of a word based on the probability of that word in a corpus, does this not assume that we, as humans, have access to probability distributions in corpora?

linguistics,Fluency vs. acculturation in pluricentric languages: Idiomatic expressions,"I was discussing this yesterday and thought it would be interesting to hear other people’s opinions. Basically, I was arguing that when it comes to pluricentric languages, it’s possible for someone to be 100% fluent, in any meaningful sense of the word (that is, in any sense that does not exclude any group of native speakers), without necessarily being privy to/able to understand all cultural references in wide usage in one or more countries where the language is spoken. In particular (and that was the critical point of the discussion), I was arguing it was true even when those references were crystalized in idiomatic expressions.

In English, for example, you have expressions such as “to hit/knock it out of the park,” which is exceedingly common in day-to-day usage in the US, but I strongly suspect there are native speakers who wouldn’t know what it means. After all, it’s closely related to sports (baseball in particular) that are not universally popular.

There’s a second group of expressions that have little or no cultural implications, but which I feel are particular to certain circles/industries, say,  business or higher education. “To take a holistic approach” would be a good example here. This is likely to be used in every English-speaking country, but only by some speakers.

Finally, there’s a third kind of idiomatic expression that I feel would be understood everywhere. “The light at the end of the tunnel” is an example of this kind: it draws its meaning from sensory experience, and traces an analogue to a situation everyone can easily conceive of.

Is this distinction reasonable, and has it been studied?",1619532334,phonologynet,7

What's the source-filter theory about? What formants can tell us? etc.

This is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.

**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**

 * Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.

 * Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.

 * Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.

 * Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.

 * English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.

We’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.

If you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.

**Discouraged Questions**

linguistics,What is a word?,"I was talking with some people about a [conlang](/r/tokima) (**con**structed **lang**uage) and we ended up arguing over whether it was isolating or synthetic. Looking at Wikipedia ([[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_language), [\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolating_language)) didn't help, since classifying a language as either isolating or synthetic needed us to determine the word-to-morpheme ratio. I argued that in the conlang-in-question, each word was one morpheme and therefore the conlang was isolating. However, one of the people I was talking with argued that the division between words is purely orthographic, and since we couldn't determine a way of separating words that doesn't rely on orthography, we had no way of determining if the conlang was isolating or synthetic.

How do we determine what is a word without relying on orthography, and how do we determine if the conlang is isolating or synthetic?",1619424800,EkskiuTwentyTwo,3

linguistics,French rhotic,"Hi there. I've been trying to find out about the development of the rhotic in the 18 century, and found a lot of conflicting information online. 

Some claim it comes from low class dialects from as far as 17th century (referencing Molière), while most claim it came from upper-class trying to imitate the king's speech manners (seems like an example of folk linguistics to me). 

It seems though, that it did most likely first emerge in the upper classes. The accent of Incroyables and Merveilleuses is said to have ""a very weak, almost non-existing R"", which may just be how people, used to the alveolar trill, perceived the uvular sound (a trill of a fricative?)

So anyway, is there any concrete evidence on

- when and how did the uvular R emerge?

- what was its realization in upper-class accent in the 18th century after the revolution?

linguistics,"Looking for native speakers of Catalan, Sevillan, Basque, Czech or Polish to beta-test a Machine Learning conjugator.","Hi everybody!

I am looking for people who are are a native speaker of Catalan, Sevillan, Basque, Czech or Polish and are willing to beta-test the software, mlconjug3.

A couple of years ago, I made a [post to announce the release of mlconjug](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/bb8400/mlconjug_a_python_library_to_conjugate_verbs_in/),  a Python package/library to conjugate verbs (even made-up verbs, or verbs coming from slang and not covered in traditional conjugation tables) in French, English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian using Machine Learning techniques.

Since then, mlconjug has had a lot of success with thousands of students of foreign languages using it as a standalone application to improve their conjugation skills, but it has also been incorporated as a library dependency in more than a dozen different python software projects ranging from traditional NLP tasks using Machine Learning, to twitter bots, Voice Assistants, and even games.

It has also been used in several Academic publications, for example: [""Generative Grading: Near Human-level Accuracy for Automated Feedback on Richly Structured Problems""](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09916) where it is used for automatically grading students essays, and  United States citizenship exam questions.

I released a new and improved version of the software, called [mlconjug3](https://github.com/SekouDiaoNlp/mlconjug3) as it is only compatible with Python 3.x, and had many enhancements and bug fixes. The accuracy of the conjugations models has improved a lot and I am in the process of implementing regional European languages (in beta version for now), like Catalan, Sevillan, Basque language, etc... as well as slavic languages (Czech and Polish for now).

Those new languages should be available in the beginning of summer and I am looking for native speakers of the languages that are in beta status to test the software and check that the conjugated forms are correct.

You can install mlconjug3 from [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mlconjug3) or [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mlconjug3).

Peace,

linguistics,Are phonetic rules considered as plagiarism?,"So, I'm an undergraduate student and I was given the task of comparing the phonetics of English and the phonetics of my native language. My paper wasn't too long (about 1000 words) but it was adequate and very informative. The deal is, in my paper I included lots of phonetic rules such as; ""Velar stop consonants have palatal allophones before front vowels"",  ""when y immediately follows a consonant, change the y to i and add es"" etc. These rules aren't anyone's own work, these are strictly common knowledge and can be found on millions of books, websites and so on.

As far as I know plagiarism is taking others' ideas, data, discovery, information and making it look like it's yours. This varies in different disciplines but generally if something is considered general knowledge or a common concept, it is NOT regarded as plagiarism.

Now, my paper was graded 54/100 by my phonetics lecturer. I e-mailed my lecturer to ask why, and he responded with this: ""You're homework has a lot of plagiarism and this is unacceptable."" He didn't specify exactly which parts were plagiarised but I am sure that it was the part that I included phonetic rules. I find this extremely unfair and I think he doesn't know what plagiarism is. He also depends only on the turnitin score and doesn't check the papers by himself to see if it's actually plagiarism. In the academic community it is well known that sometimes turnitin can be incorrect and the teacher always has the check the paper by him/herself to be sure.

linguistics,"Are there any examples of ""lucky"" foreign accents? (I don't know a term, but I'll explain what I mean below)","Say someone speaks English, from London. If they learn French, they're likely to have an identifiable English accent in their French. Same goes if they learn Portuguese, Japanese, or most other languages.

But I imagine the features of an English accent in another language change in importance and relevance between the other languages. Isn't it theoretically possible that an English accent in another language - say Khmer - could actually have similar enough sounds as to actually *not* be very different from native speech of that language? I know the situation isn't true for Khmer, but I'm just throwing out a random language because I don't know any that it is true for.

Or is it the case that there's just too much possible variation and actual specificity in human language for what I'm describing to actually happen?

I also imagine that my question (like most) has aspects of degree. It would make sense to me that an English accent would be more apparent in Kiswahili than in Dutch. But I'm curious about the possible extreme where an accent actually helps pronunciation significantly in a foreign language.

The word roots with **Ara** 'wheel', 'radius' etc. but the word **arya**\- 'master' 'lord', 'noble' so Europeans figured who else can be this and this is where the myth of ""European Invasion"" came about, and what this means is the mythical invasion of europeans into the East. This finally was dismissed in 1960's after the fall of radical Nazism, no one wanted that theory. But around the same time Mariua Gimbutas made a theory based on another popularity, PIE cult begins. See Europeans cannot fathom that language has spread form east to west. They read all these sound laws, and then called them Grimms law. This is to take away from Sanskrit. But essentially the theory of PIE is a HUGE CONFIRMATION BIAS. See PIE is a cult, it's not real. The reason there is an (\*) next to the word, is to let you know, its made up. That's right remade, recreated.After reading academic journals, you come to realize the flaws in these papers. This is especially true when comparing it to Sanskirt. There is a huge push to make words originate in Europe. These people have ZERO understanding of Sanskrit and the peer review conducted are conducted by people who have a superficial view of Sanskrit and don't understand it. So they cannot tell if the words in comparison are a real close match.

Let me show examples.(Cambridge Press, Indo-European Linguistics: An Introduction, James Clackson)Page 49  


|Sanskrit|Latin|Greek|English|Meaning|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||\-fīdēs-|peíthomai|bide'|'trust'|
|budh||punthánō|bode|'make aware'|
|bandh|\-fend-||bind|'daub'|
|bāhu-||pēkhu||'fore-arm'|

&amp;#x200B;

**First** mistake, the Sanskrit column has no equivalent as stated by the author. The word in Sanskrit is actually **vad** 'affirm', 'declare', 'address' but really it means 'to promise' which equates to 'trust'. **Second** mistake is the Greek **peíthomai** is actally **peítho** \+ **mai** which actually means 'I know'. You can see this in Hindi, **pata** **me** 'i know' and can be the same as 'addressing'. These both come from Sanskrit, but not as 'trust'. And for those of you who are morons that think they aren't related, Hindi **kaise hain** 'how are you', Greek **geia sou** 'hello' and the exact match would be in Hindi **kaise** 'hey'. THEY BOTH COME FROM SANSKRIT. The meaning **trust** has even a better equivalent in Sanskrit, **dṛṣṭa** 'to make visible', 'visible', 'apparent', 'noticed', 'regarded', 'considered' etc. which is the same exact meaning of **trust** 'having faith', 'firm belief', but also in pronunciation because **trust** = **dṛṣṭa**.

**Third** mistake, 3rd row, **bandh** = bind which does confirm to english. The Latin **-fend-** comes form 'offense', 'defense', 'fend'(I'm sure I can find a better Sanskrit match). But the meaning is explained as **daub**. **Daub** is defined as coat or smear with a thick or sticky substance . The Sanskrit word closest to this definition is **tip** 'to sprinkle', 'ooze', 'to drop', 'to leak'. Not only are the wrong words used, but the wrong meaning is too.

Understand, as to bring out history, the British would hang signs ""*No Dogs*, *No Indians*"". They didn't even want the input of Indians especially when it came to linguistics. And lets face it. What the west cowardly calls ""Arabic Numerals"" hasn't even been corrected because its actually called Hindu-Numerals, as it was Al-Kindi who named his books ""Kitāb...al-Hindīyyah"" regard and give respect and credit to Hindus. And so far, no history books have actually corrected it. And whats audacious is they still think Greeks created mathematics, because of someone in history who made a narrative based on falsehoods. But instead of thinking it's Indian Nationalism, maybe Indians like people to understand there's ""European History"" based on bias, and then their's actual history based on facts. There is ""European Linguistics"" and there is ""Linguistics"" based on facts.

What is true is European Languages are flooded with a phenomena called ""Semantic Shift"", the meaning keeps changing. But that's why Caste system was actually created, to adhere and stick actual meanings of words as well as spelling, scholastic pursuits by Brahmins, Ksatriya- defend the borders and protect people, Vaishya are the merchants and create economy, and Sudras do physical work. Thousands of years ago it wasn't about supremacy, it was about how each did their work because each are vital for this ecosystem to work. Vedas says, Sudra are the feet, Vaisyas are the thighs, Ksatriyas are the arms and hands, Brahmins are the mind or brain, the eyes are of god; without one of these it cannot sustain and work. That was how each regarded one another, same respect in their own field.

I am writing a paper in Linguistics, and I'll prove everyday words in English are actually Sanskrit words, But also connecting it to other languages where it'll be mind blowing, so much so the cultic practices of Linguistic Reconstruction will most likely be disbanded, and we will shift our understanding.

linguistics,Saphir hypotesis,"Hello people, I am new to this subreddit.
I have read about the Saphir-Whorf hypothesis about how language can influence our thoughts and behaviours.

I found it very interesting, and I have a question I'd like to discuss: at what extent is Saphir hypothesis acceptable before getting too extreme and difficult to accept?

He'd got a valid point in stating that if there is a concept that my language doesn't have a word for, it means that I cannot imagine it. How could the ancient greeks have thought about the word Astronaut, even though the words for universe and sailor already existed? There were no space missions at those times, so it is possible that they couldn't imagine any related word.

Let's think about europe before 1492, tomatoes were yet to be introduced from America, europeans didn't have a word for Tomatoes because they didn't know about their existence, hence their language didn't need to label a concept no one knew anything about. As a result europeans could not imagine the concept of tomatoes because european languages didn't have a word for it.

I don't see how this statement can be denied, as as long as a language is not aware of a concept it cannot label it and explain it to its speakers; as a result, its speaker cannot imagine that concept.

By ""caveman speech,"" I mean how the language demonstrates what early or primitive language is supposed to sound like - as an example, in English, you might hear something like ""Me want eat berry!"" or something like that (obviously it feels ridiculous typing it out lol). Although the majority of the times I've heard ""caveman speech"" it has been in my native language of English, as I've begun learning other languages I've noticed that often times the ways that other languages attempt to portray caveman speech is often similar to standard English grammar and vice versa. So, for example, I've noticed that, if the language has a case system and/or conjugates verbs based on person rather than relying on pronouns, these aspects tend to be dropped in caveman speech - just like how they are already absent in standard English grammar. On the other hand, when English tries to portray caveman speech, there is a tendency to drop articles, copulas, and to rely less on do-support - all of which are absent in the standard grammars of many other languages. To be clear, I don't think that there is anything particularly special about English in regards to caveman speech; the only reason I have specifically been using it as an example is because, again, it is my native language and the one I speak most proficiently.

She said the norwegian word ""kom"" is more inclined to suggest ejaculation, and that the english word ""come"" didn't have much of an impact. It depends on the language itself probably, or maybe the fact that english is her second language. I don't know...

But it's safe to say that a common denominator for languages are found within the meanings we attach to them. Both ""come"" and ""kom"" has undergone a strange semantic shift, and I have no idea how this evolution came about.

Any ideas?",1619045206,International-Cat176,1
linguistics,Simple explanation for the English Subjunctive,"I'm learning Spanish, which uses the subjunctive quite a lot. It is difficult to get an example of how it is used in English though for reference. My idea is that in English, we just say ""may"" or ""could"" to express the subjunctive, like ""he may go, if he wants"", or ""I killed the fox, so that the birds could live"".

linguistics,Is there a reason why some languages have something like the Rhythm Rule of English and others don't?,"In English, the citation form of the numeral expression *twenty-two* has the stress contour in (1a), not the one in (1b).

    (1a)   twenty-twó
    (1b) * twénty-two

However, when one concatenates it with a noun bearing primary stress (´), the stress contour of the word changes. Specifically, there appears to be a retraction of secondary stress (`) to avoid stress clash: (2b) trumps (2a).

    (2a) * twenty-twò mén
    (2b)   twènty-two mén

This phenomenon is entirely absent in Spanish:

    (3a)   veintidós
    (3b) * véintidos
    (4a)   veintidòs hómbres
    (4b) * vèintidos hómbres

Why? Is it because Spanish is syllable-timed and English stressed-timed? Is it because English **A N** structures constitute a single domain for stress rules while the Spanish ones don't? Is there anything interesting to say about how languages class w.r.t having these rhythmic effects in their stress systems?",1619033635,hunapolzki,13

linguistics,The Japanese r sound,"Now, I'm pretty sure this question has atleast appeared once on this subreddit, but I still have to ask, how one would classify the japanese r sound. From listening to japanese speakers and doing a fair amount of research I've deduced a few common realizations of the r phoneme in Japanese (in my opinion): 

-A [voiced alveolar tap ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_dental_and_alveolar_taps_and_flaps) [ɾ] (or also post-alveolar [ɾ̠])
-A  [voiced alveolar lateral approximant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_dental,_alveolar_and_postalveolar_lateral_approximants#Voiced_alveolar_lateral_approximant) [l] 
-A [voiced alveolar lateral tap](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_dental_and_alveolar_lateral_flaps#Alveolar)[ɺ]
-A [voiced alveolar plosive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_dental_and_alveolar_plosives) [d]

Those seem to be the main (and most common) ones. Ofc there's also more uncommon ones like: [ɭ], [r], [ɖ], [ɮ] and [ɽ](according to wikipedia), but those are less important. 

In conclusion, I wanted to ask for confirmation on whether or not this is correct (I figured this would be the best subreddit to do so).

linguistics,When are numbers part of a (specific) language?,"Hi everyone,

since some time I am wondering about the time when we can say that numbers are part of a language. So think like this: Arithmetics, counting and the like are not known in many language communities around the world. At some point, people from the outside came (missionaries, colonial officers, etc.) and brought the concept with them. Even if some form of counting was known before, many peoples have adopted a decimal system and integrated it into their language. 

Or another example: In a language I am doing currently research on, one of the speakers created a decimal system that works with native terms based on the model of English. But he and maybe some of his relatives are the only ones that use this system today. 

So I was wondering: What is the starting point? When can we say, oh now language XY has numbers, before it didn't have numbers? Note well: I am not talking about any type of quantification - of course people can always express concepts like 'some, nothing' or even singularity and plurality in one form or another. I am really talking about those things that symbols like 1,2,3,4,5,6... express.

I am especially puzzled by the fact that even in Indo-european languages - where we would think they all have arithmetics and numbers of course - children have to struggle many years through tough education to get them right.

So share your opinions, thanks.

People support the Quebec language laws/bill, say French is threatened in Canada. Well, if you need a law to save your language, you've already lost the battle.

When people travel to third world countries, there are many countries where, even though you won't know the local language; people will treat you with dignity and respect. There are countries like Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan etc. where people aren't trying to even rip a foreigner off, they are hospitable and treat guests like loyalty, even though many people there are poor, and have a hard time providing for their families, forget about supporting foreign guests.
