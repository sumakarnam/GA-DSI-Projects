    "\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa using extensive [data](../datasets/train.csv) about various features of the house (79 features about the size, quality, amenities etc.). A detailed description of the dataset can be found in the [data description](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt)\n",
    "\n",
    "The house prices are predicted using a Linear Regression model and the model was tuned to minimize root mean square error on the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Statement: As the observed house prices have a log normal distribution, in addition to predicting the house prices for the 878 houses in the [test data](../datasets/test.csv), this analysis aims to determine if predicting log prices instead of prices gives a better fitting model and to quantify the lift in R<sup>2</sup> if this is indeed the case."

    "These models had very similar performance, with the log price model outperforming the price model marginally on the test data (R<sup>2</sup> of 0.81 vs 0.82 on the test data). The RMSE on this particular training data was much higher for the log Price model compared to the price model (44008 vs 36203). This is likely an effect of some variance in the model and higher representation of some categories in the train dataset.\n",

    "- Conclusions\n",
    "    - The various iterations did not make a considerable difference to the model performance from the base model with R<sup>2</sup> of 0.81\n",
    "    - The mean encoded variables generally have the highest coefficients as expected across all the models\n",
    "    - The performance of the model with the mean encoding of the selected variables was considerably higher than when these variables were one-hot encoded (This analysis is not included in the report)\n",
    "- Further Improvements\n",
    "    - In cases where one of the features was dropped in favor of another due to high correlation between the two,\n",
    "    it will be interesting to see the effect of building a model with the dropped feature instead of the feature that was used (example: 'Garage Area' vs 'Garage Cars')\n",
    "    - Creating more interaction terms by using the product of the two highly correlated similar variables and analysing the effect on the model (example: 'Gr Liv Area' vs '1st Flr SF' and '2nd Flr SF')\n",
    "    - Building separate models for various groups of Neighborhoods\n",
    "    - Investigate other ways to address multicollinearity\n"
